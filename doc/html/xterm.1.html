<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
xterm - terminal
emulator for X 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>xterm</b> [-<i>toolkitoption</i> ...] [-<i>option</i> ...] [<i>shell</i>] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
The
<i>xterm</i> program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides
DEC VT102/VT220 (VTxxx) and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs
that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating
system supports terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH
signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), <i>xterm</i> will use the facilities to
notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized. <p>
The VTxxx
and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you can
edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the same time. To
maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix graphics will
be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit
in the window. This box is located in the upper left area of the window.
<p>
Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
considered the ``active'' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
output. This is the window that contains the text cursor. The active window
can be chosen through escape sequences, the ``VT Options'' menu in the VTxxx
window, and the ``Tek Options'' menu in the 4014 window. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Emulations</a></h2>
The VT102
emulation is fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat. Double-size
characters are displayed properly if your font server supports scalable
fonts. The VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise
complete. <a href='Termcap.5.html'><i>Termcap</i>(5)</a>
 entries that work with <i>xterm</i> include an optional platform-specific
entry, ``xterm,'' ``vt102,'' ``vt100'' and ``ansi,'' and ``dumb.'' <i>xterm</i> automatically searches
the termcap file in this order for these entries and then sets the ``TERM''
and the ``TERMCAP'' environment variables. You may also use ``vt220,''  but must
set the terminal emulation level with the <b>decTerminalID</b> resource. (The ``TERMCAP''
environment variable is not set if <i>xterm</i> is linked against a terminfo library,
since the requisite information is not provided by the termcap emulation
of terminfo libraries). <p>
Many of the special <i>xterm</i> features may be modified
under program control through a set of escape sequences different from
the standard VT102 escape sequences. (See the <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> document.)
<p>
The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good. It supports 12-bit graphics
addressing, scaled to the window size. Four different font sizes and five
different lines types are supported. There is no write-through or defocused
mode support. The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally
by <i>xterm</i> and may be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence
(or through the <b>Tektronix</b> menu; see below). The name of the file will be
``<b>COPY<i>yyyy<b>-<i>MM<b>-<i>dd<b>.<i>hh<b>:<i>mm<b>:<i>ss</i></b></i></b></i></b></i></b></i></b></i></b>'', where <i>yyyy</i>, <i>MM</i>, <i>dd</i>, <i>hh</i>, <i>mm</i> and <i>ss</i> are the year, month,
day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed (the file is created
in the directory <i>xterm</i> is started in, or the home directory for a login
<i>xterm</i>). <p>
Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily
available in this version of <i>xterm</i>. Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are
available only if they were compiled in, though the most commonly-used are
in the default configuration. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Other Features</a></h2>
<i>Xterm</i> automatically highlights
the text cursor when the pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights
it when the pointer leaves the window (unselected). If the window is the
focus window, then the text cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer
is. <p>
In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate
an alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area
of the window. When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced
with the alternate screen. Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window
is disabled until the normal screen is restored. The <a href='termcap.5.html'><i>termcap</i>(5)</a>
 entry for
<i>xterm</i> allows the visual editor <a href='vi.1.html'><i>vi</i>(1)</a>
 to switch to the alternate screen
for editing and to restore the screen on exit. A popup menu entry makes
it simple to switch between the normal and alternate screens for cut and
paste. <p>
In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to
change the name of the windows. Additionally, in VT102 mode, <i>xterm</i> implements
the window-manipulation control sequences from <i>dtterm</i>, such as resizing
the window, setting its location on the screen. <p>
<i>Xterm</i> allows character-based
applications to receive mouse events (currently button-press and release
events, and button-motion events) as keyboard control sequences. See <i>Xterm
Control Sequences</i> for details. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Options</a></h2>
The <i>xterm</i> terminal emulator accepts
the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as many application-specific
options. If the option begins with a `<b>+</b>' instead of a `<b>-</b>', the option is restored
to its default value. The <b>-version</b> and <b>-help</b> options are interpreted even
if <i>xterm</i> cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration
scripts: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-version</b> </dt>
<dd>This causes <i>xterm</i> to print a version number to the standard
output. </dd>

<dt><b>-help</b> </dt>
<dd>This causes <i>xterm</i> to print out a verbose message describing
its options, one per line. The message is written to the standard output.
<i>Xterm</i> generates this message, sorting it and noting whether a "<b>-option</b>"
or a "<b>+option</b>" turns the feature on or off, since some features historically
have been one or the other. <i>Xterm</i> generates a concise help message (multiple
options per line) when an unknown option is used, e.g., <dl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>xterm -z</b><br>
</dd>
</dl>
 </dl>
</dl>
<p>
If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled into
<i>xterm</i>, the help text for that option also is not displayed by the <b>-help</b>
option. <p>
One parameter (after all options) may be given. That overrides <i>xterm</i>'s
built-in choice of shell program. Normally <i>xterm</i> checks the SHELL variable.
If that is not set, <i>xterm</i> tries to use the shell program specified in the
password file. If that is not set, <i>xterm</i> uses <i>/bin/sh</i>. If the parameter names
an executable file, <i>xterm</i> uses that instead. The parameter must be an absolute
path, or name a file found on the user's PATH (and thereby construct an
absolute path). The <b>-e</b> option cannot be used with this parameter since it
uses all parameters following the option. <p>
The other options are used to
control the appearance and behavior. Not all options are necessarily configured
into your copy of <i>xterm</i>: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-132</b> </dt>
<dd>Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence
that switches between 80 and 132 column mode is ignored. This option causes
the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the <i>xterm</i> window will
resize appropriately. </dd>

<dt><b>-ah</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should always
highlight the text cursor. By default, <i>xterm</i> will display a hollow text
cursor whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the window. </dd>

<dt><b>+ah</b>
</dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should do text cursor highlighting based
on focus. </dd>

<dt><b>-ai</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables active icon support if that feature was
compiled into <i>xterm</i>. This is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i> resource <b>activeIcon</b>
to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+ai</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables active icon support if that feature was
compiled into <i>xterm</i>. This is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i> resource <b>activeIcon</b>
to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-aw</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed.
This allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next
line when when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text is output.
</dd>

<dt><b>+aw</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed. </dd>

<dt><b>-b</b><i> number</i>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between
the outer edge of the characters and the window border) in pixels. That
is the <i>vt100</i> <i>internalBorder</i> resource. The default is 2. </dd>

<dt><b>+bc</b> </dt>
<dd>turn off text
cursor blinking. This overrides the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-bc</b> </dt>
<dd>turn on text
cursor blinking. This overrides the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-bcf</b><i> milliseconds</i>
</dt>
<dd>set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the <i>cursorOffTime</i>
resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-bcn</b><i> milliseconds</i> </dt>
<dd>set the amount of time text cursor is on when
blinking via the <i>cursorOffTime</i> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-bdc</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b>colorBDMode</b>
to ``false'', disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color
</dd>

<dt><b>+bdc</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b>colorBDMode</b> to ``true'', enabling the display of
characters with bold attribute as color rather than bold </dd>

<dt><b>-cb</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the <i>vt100</i>
resource <b>cutToBeginningOfLine</b> to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+cb</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b>cutToBeginningOfLine</b>
to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-cc <i>characterclassrange</i>:<i>value</i>[,...]</b> </dt>
<dd>This sets classes indicated by
the given ranges for using in selecting by words. See the section specifying
character classes. and discussion of the <i>charClass</i> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-cjk_width</b> </dt>
<dd>Set
the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource to ``true''. When turned on, characters with East Asian
Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2. Otherwise, they
have a column width of 1. This may be useful for some legacy CJK text terminal-based
programs assuming box drawings and others to have a column width of 2. It
also has to be turned on when you specify a TrueType CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace)
font either with <b>-fa</b> at the command line or <b>faceName</b> resource. The default
is ``false'' </dd>

<dt><b>+cjk_width</b> </dt>
<dd>Reset the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-class</b><i> string</i> </dt>
<dd>This option
allows you to override <i>xterm</i>'s resource class. Normally it is ``XTerm'', but
can be set to another class such as ``UXTerm'' to override selected resources.
</dd>

<dt><b>-cm</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
It sets the <i>colorMode</i> resource to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+cm</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables recognition
of ANSI color-change escape sequences. This is the same as the <i>vt100</i> resource
<b>colorMode</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-cn</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode
selections. It sets the <i>cutNewline</i> resource to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+cn</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates
that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections. It sets the <i>cutNewline</i>
resource to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-cr</b><i> color</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the color to use for text
cursor. The default is to use the same foreground color that is used for
text. It sets the <i>cursorColor</i> resource according to the parameter. </dd>

<dt><b>-cu</b> </dt>
<dd>This
option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should work around a bug in the <a href='more.1.html'><i>more</i>(1)</a>
 program
that causes it to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width
of the window and are followed by a line beginning with a tab (the leading
tabs are not displayed). This option is so named because it was originally
thought to be a bug in the <a href='curses.3.html'><i>curses</i>(3x)</a>
 cursor motion package. </dd>

<dt><b>+cu</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not work around the <a href='more.1.html'><i>more</i>(1)</a>
 bug mentioned above.
</dd>

<dt><b>-dc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors: the
vt100 foreground and background colors, its text cursor color, the pointer
cursor foreground and background colors, the Tektronix emulator foreground
and background colors, its text cursor color and highlight color. The option
sets the <i>dynamicColors</i> option to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+dc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables the escape
sequence to change dynamic colors. The option sets the <i>dynamicColors</i> option
to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-e</b><i> program [ <i>arguments </i>... ]<i></i> </i></dt>
<dd>This option specifies the program (and
its command line arguments) to be run in the <i>xterm</i> window. It also sets
the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being
executed if neither <i>-T</i> nor <i>-n</i> are given on the command line. <b>This must be
the last option on the command line.</b> </dd>

<dt><b>-en</b><i> encoding</i> </dt>
<dd>This option determines
the encoding on which <i>xterm</i> runs. It sets the <b>locale</b> resource. Encodings
other than UTF-8 are supported by using <i>luit</i>. The <b>-lc</b> option should be used
instead of <b>-en</b> for systems with locale support. </dd>

<dt><b>-fb</b><i> font</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies
a font to be used when displaying bold text. This font must be the same
height and width as the normal font. If only one of the normal or bold fonts
is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold font will
be produced by overstriking this font. The default is to do overstriking
of the normal font. See also the discussion of <b>boldFont</b> and <b>boldMode</b> resources.
</dd>

<dt><b>-fa</b><i> pattern</i> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into <i>xterm</i>. This corresponds
to the <b>faceName</b> resource. When a CJK double-width font is specified, you
also need to turn on the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-fbb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that
<i>xterm</i> should compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they
are compatible. It sets the <b>freeBoldBox</b> resource to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+fbb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible. It sets the <b>freeBoldBox</b> resource to
``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-fbx</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not assume that the normal
and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters. If any are missing, <i>xterm</i>
will draw the characters directly. It sets the <b>forceBoxChars</b> resource to
``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+fbx</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should assume that the normal
and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters. It sets the <b>forceBoxChars</b>
resource to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>-fd</b><i> pattern</i> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the pattern for double-width
fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library was
compiled into <i>xterm</i>. This corresponds to the <b>faceNameDoublesize</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>-fi</b><i> font</i> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was
compiled into <i>xterm</i>. See also the discussion of the <b>iconFont</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-fs</b><i>
size</i> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into <i>xterm</i>. This corresponds
to the <b>faceSize</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-fw <i>font</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the font to be used
for displaying wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a font twice
as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text. If no doublewidth
font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font. This corresponds
to the <b>wideFont</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-fwb <i>font</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the font to be
used for displaying bold wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a
font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text. If no
doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font.
This corresponds to the <b>wideBoldFont</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-fx <i>font</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies
the font to be used for displaying the preedit string in the "OverTheSpot"
input method. See also the discussion of the <b>ximFont</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-hc</b><i> color</i> </dt>
<dd>This
option specifies the color to use for the background of selected or otherwise
highlighted text. If not specified, reverse video is used. See the discussion
of the <b>highlightColor</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-hf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that HP Function
Key escape codes should be generated for function keys. It sets the <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>
resource to ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>+hf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that HP Function Key escape
codes should not be generated for function keys. It sets the <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>
resource to ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>-hold</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn on the <b>hold</b> resource, i.e., <i>xterm</i> will not immediately
destroy its window when the shell command completes. It will wait until
you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the
menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL. </dd>

<dt><b>+hold</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn off the <b>hold</b>
resource, i.e., <i>xterm</i> will immediately destroy its window when the shell
command completes. </dd>

<dt><b>-ie</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn on the <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resource, i.e., use the
pseudo-terminal's sense of the stty erase value. </dd>

<dt><b>+ie</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn off the <b>ptyInitialErase</b>
resource, i.e., set the stty erase value using the <b>kb</b> string from the termcap
entry as a reference, if available. </dd>

<dt><b>-im</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn on the <b>useInsertMode</b> resource,
which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable. </dd>

<dt><b>+im</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn off the <b>useInsertMode</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-into</b><i> windowId</i>
</dt>
<dd>Given an X window identifier (a decimal integer), <i>xterm</i> will reparent its
top-level shell widget to that window. This is used to embed <i>xterm</i> within
other applications. </dd>

<dt><b>-j</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should do jump scrolling.
It corresponds to the <b>jumpScroll</b> resource. Normally, text is scrolled one
line at a time; this option allows <i>xterm</i> to move multiple lines at a time
so that it does not fall as far behind. Its use is strongly recommended
since it makes <i>xterm</i> much faster when scanning through large amounts of
text. The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and disabling smooth scroll
as well as the ``VT Options'' menu can be used to turn this feature on or off.
</dd>

<dt><b>+j</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not do jump scrolling. </dd>

<dt><b>-k8</b> </dt>
<dd>This
option sets the <b>allowC1Printable</b> resource. When <b>allowC1Printable</b> is set,
<i>xterm</i> overrides the mapping of C1 control characters (code 128-159) to treat
them as printable. </dd>

<dt><b>+k8</b> </dt>
<dd>This option resets the <b>allowC1Printable</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>-kt</b><i> keyboardtype</i> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the <b>keyboardType</b> resource. Possible values
include: ``unknown'', ``default'', ``hp'', ``sco'', ``sun'' and ``vt220''. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The value ``unknown'', causes
the corresponding resource to be ignored. </dl>
<p>
The value ``default'', suppresses
the associated resources <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>, <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>, <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>
and <b>sunKeyboard</b>, using the Sun/PC keyboard layout. 
<dl>

<dt><b>-l</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn logging on. Normally
logging is not supported, due to security concerns. Some versions of <i>xterm</i>
may have logging enabled. The logfile is written to the directory from which
<i>xterm</i> is invoked. The filename is generated, of the form <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XtermLog.<i>XXXXXX</i><br>
 <p>
or <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xterm.log.<i>hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX</i><br>
 <p>
depending on how <i>xterm</i> was built. </dd>

<dt><b>+l</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn logging off. </dd>

<dt><b>-lc</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn on support
of various encodings according to the users' locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL,
LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables. This is achieved by turning on
UTF-8 mode and by invoking <i>luit</i> for conversion between locale encodings
and UTF-8. (<i>luit</i> is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.) This corresponds to the
<b>locale</b> resource. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined
by <i>luit</i>. Consult the <i>luit</i> manual page for further details. See also the discussion
of the <b>-u8</b> option which supports UTF-8 locales. 
<dl>

<dt><b>+lc</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn off support of automatic
selection of locale encodings. Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales
or with <b>-u8</b> option, UTF-8 mode will be used. </dd>

<dt><b>-lcc</b><i> path</i> </dt>
<dd>File name for the encoding
converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with <b>-lc</b> option
or <b>locale</b> resource. This corresponds to the <b>localeFilter</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-leftbar</b>
</dt>
<dd>Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen. This is the default, unless
you have set the rightScrollBar resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-lf</b><i> filename</i> </dt>
<dd>Specify the log-filename.
See the <b>-l</b> option. </dd>

<dt><b>-ls</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that the shell that is started
in the <i>xterm</i> window will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0]
will be a dash, indicating to the shell that it should read the user's .login
or .profile). </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The <b>-ls</b> flag and the <b>loginShell</b> resource are ignored if <b>-e</b> is
also given, because <i>xterm</i> does not know how to make the shell start the
given command after whatever it does when it is a login shell - the user's
shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all. Also, <i>xterm&nbsp;-e</i> is supposed
to provide a consistent functionality for other applications that need
to start text-mode programs in a window, and if <b>loginShell</b> were not ignored,
the result of ~/.profile might interfere with that. </dl>
<p>
If you do want the effect
of <b>-ls</b> and <b>-e</b> simultaneously, you may get away with something like <dl>xterm
-e /bin/bash -l -c "my command here" </dl>
</dl>
<p>
Finally, <b>-ls</b> is not completely ignored,
because <i>xterm&nbsp;-ls&nbsp;-e</i> does write a <i>/etc/wtmp</i> entry (if configured to do so),
whereas <i>xterm&nbsp;-e</i> does not. 
<dl>

<dt><b>+ls</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that the shell that is
started should not be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal ``subshell'').
</dd>

<dt><b>-mb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should ring a margin bell when the
user types near the right end of a line. This option can be turned on and
off from the ``VT Options'' menu. </dd>

<dt><b>+mb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that margin bell
should not be rung. </dd>

<dt><b>-mc</b><i> milliseconds</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the maximum time
between multi-click selections. </dd>

<dt><b>-mesg</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn off the <b>messages</b> resource, i.e.,
disallow write access to the terminal. </dd>

<dt><b>+mesg</b> </dt>
<dd>Turn on the <b>messages</b> resource,
i.e., allow write access to the terminal. </dd>

<dt><b>-mk_width</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the <b>mkWidth</b> resource
to ``true''. This makes <i>xterm</i> use a built-in version of the wide-character width
calculation. The default is ``false'' </dd>

<dt><b>+mk_width</b> </dt>
<dd>Reset the <b>mkWidth</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-ms</b><i>
color</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor.
The default is to use the foreground color. This sets the <i>pointerColor</i> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>-nb</b><i> number</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the number of characters from the right
end of a line at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring. The default
is 10. </dd>

<dt><b>-nul</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables the display of underlining. </dd>

<dt><b>+nul</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
enables the display of underlining. </dd>

<dt><b>-pc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables the PC-style use
of bold colors (see boldColors resource). </dd>

<dt><b>+pc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables the PC-style
use of bold colors. </dd>

<dt><b>-pob</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that the window should be
raised whenever a Control-G is received. </dd>

<dt><b>+pob</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that
the window should not be raised whenever a Control-G is received. </dd>

<dt><b>-rightbar</b>
</dt>
<dd>Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen. </dd>

<dt><b>-rvc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables
the display of characters with reverse attribute as color. </dd>

<dt><b>+rvc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color. </dd>

<dt><b>-rw</b> </dt>
<dd>This
option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed. This allows the
cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost
column of the previous line. This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines and is encouraged. This option can be turned on and off from
the ``VT Options'' menu. </dd>

<dt><b>+rw</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should
not be allowed. </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> may scroll asynchronously,
meaning that the screen does not have to be kept completely up to date
while scrolling. This allows <i>xterm</i> to run faster when network latencies
are very high and is typically useful when running across a very large
internet or many gateways. </dd>

<dt><b>+s</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should scroll
synchronously. </dd>

<dt><b>-samename</b> </dt>
<dd>Does not send title and icon name change requests
when the request would have no effect: the name is not changed. This has
the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an
extra round trip to the server to find out the previous value. In practice
this should never be a problem. </dd>

<dt><b>+samename</b> </dt>
<dd>Always send title and icon name
change requests. </dd>

<dt><b>-sb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that some number of lines that
are scrolled off the top of the window should be saved and that a scrollbar
should be displayed so that those lines can be viewed. This option may be
turned on and off from the ``VT Options'' menu. </dd>

<dt><b>+sb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that
a scrollbar should not be displayed. </dd>

<dt><b>-sf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that Sun Function
Key escape codes should be generated for function keys. </dd>

<dt><b>+sf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for function
keys. </dd>

<dt><b>-si</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that output to a window should not automatically
reposition the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region. This option
can be turned on and off from the ``VT Options'' menu. </dd>

<dt><b>+si</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates
that output to a window should cause it to scroll to the bottom. </dd>

<dt><b>-sk</b> </dt>
<dd>This
option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review
previous lines of text should cause the window to be repositioned automatically
in the normal position at the bottom of the scroll region. </dd>

<dt><b>+sk</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar should not cause
the window to be repositioned. </dd>

<dt><b>-sl</b><i> number</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the number
of lines to save that have been scrolled off the top of the screen. This
corresponds to the <b>saveLines</b> resource. The default is 64. </dd>

<dt><b>-sm</b> </dt>
<dd>This option,
corresponding to the <b>sessionMgt</b> resource, indicates that <i>xterm</i> should set
up session manager callbacks. </dd>

<dt><b>+sm</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should
not set up session manager callbacks. </dd>

<dt><b>-sp</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that Sun/PC
keyboard should be assumed, providing mapping for keypad `+' to `,', and CTRL-F1
to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc. </dd>

<dt><b>+sp</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that the standard
escape codes should be generated for keypad and function keys. </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that <i>xterm</i> should start in Tektronix mode, rather than in VT102
mode. Switching between the two windows is done using the ``Options'' menus.
<a href='Termcap.5.html'><i>Termcap</i>(5)</a>
 entries that work with <i>xterm</i> ``tek4014,'' ``tek4015,'' ``tek4012'', ``tek4013''
and ``tek4010,'' and ``dumb.'' <i>xterm</i> automatically searches the termcap file in
this order for these entries and then sets the ``TERM'' and the ``TERMCAP'' environment
variables. </dd>

<dt><b>+t</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should start in VT102 mode.
</dd>

<dt><b>-tb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option, corresponding to the <b>toolBar</b> resource, indicates that <i>xterm</i>
should display a toolbar (or menubar) at the top of its window. The buttons
in the toolbar correspond to the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for
"Main Options". </dd>

<dt><b>+tb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not set up a
toolbar. </dd>

<dt><b>-ti</b><i> term_id</i> </dt>
<dd>Specify the name used by <i>xterm</i> to select the correct
response to terminal ID queries. It also specifies the emulation level,
used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence. Valid values
include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, and vt220 (the "vt" is optional). The
default is vt100. The term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to use.
(This is the same as the <b>decTerminalID</b> resource). </dd>

<dt><b>-tm</b><i> string</i> </dt>
<dd>This option
specifies a series of terminal setting keywords followed by the characters
that should be bound to those functions, similar to the <i>stty</i> program. The
keywords and their values are described in detail in the <b>ttyModes</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>-tn</b><i> name</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in
the TERM environment variable. It corresponds to the <b>termName</b> resource. This
terminal type must exist in the terminal database (termcap or terminfo,
depending on how <i>xterm</i> is built) and should have <i>li#</i> and <i>co#</i> entries. If
the terminal type is not found, <i>xterm</i> uses the built-in list ``xterm'', ``vt102'',
etc. </dd>

<dt><b>-u8</b> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the <b>utf8</b> resource. When <b>utf8</b> is set, <i>xterm</i> interprets
incoming data as UTF-8. This sets the <b>wideChars</b> resource as a side-effect,
but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from being turned off.
If you must turn it on and off, use the <b>wideChars</b> resource. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
This option
and the <b>utf8</b> resource are overridden by the <b>-lc</b> and <b>-en</b> options and <b>locale</b>
resource. That is, if <i>xterm</i> has been compiled to support <i>luit</i>, and the <b>locale</b>
resource is not ``false'' this option is ignored. We recommend using the <b>-lc</b>
option or the ``<b>locale:&nbsp;true</b>'' resource in UTF-8 locales when your operating
system supports locale, or <b>-en&nbsp;UTF-8</b> option or the ``<b>locale:&nbsp;UTF-8</b>'' resource when
your operating system does not support locale. 
<dl>

<dt><b>+u8</b> </dt>
<dd>This option resets the
<b>utf8</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-ulc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option disables the display of characters with underline
attribute as color rather than with underlining. </dd>

<dt><b>+ulc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables
the display of characters with underline attribute as color rather than
with underlining. </dd>

<dt><b>-ut</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not write a
record into the the system <i>utmp</i> log file. </dd>

<dt><b>+ut</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that
<i>xterm</i> should write a record into the system <i>utmp</i> log file. </dd>

<dt><b>-vb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one. Instead of
ringing the terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the window will
be flashed. </dd>

<dt><b>+vb</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.
</dd>

<dt><b>-wc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option sets the <b>wideChars</b> resource. When <b>wideChars</b> is set, <i>xterm</i>
maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters. If you do not set this
resource to ``true'', <i>xterm</i> will ignore the escape sequence which turns UTF-8
mode on and off. The default is ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>+wc</b> </dt>
<dd>This option resets the <b>wideChars</b>
resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-wf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should wait for the window
to be mapped the first time before starting the subprocess so that the
initial terminal size settings and environment variables are correct. It
is the application's responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.
</dd>

<dt><b>+wf</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not wait before starting the
subprocess. </dd>

<dt><b>-ziconbeep <i>percent</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Same as zIconBeep resource. If percent is non-zero,
xterms that produce output while iconified will cause an XBell sound at
the given volume and have "***" prepended to their icon titles. Most window
managers will detect this change immediately, showing you which window
has the output. (A similar feature was in x10 <i>xterm</i>.) </dd>

<dt><b>-C</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates
that this window should receive console output. This is not supported on
all systems. To obtain console output, you must be the owner of the console
device, and you must have read and write permission for it. If you are running
X under <i>xdm</i> on the console screen you may need to have the session startup
and reset programs explicitly change the ownership of the console device
in order to get this option to work. </dd>

<dt><b>-S<i>ccn</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option allows <i>xterm</i> to be
used as an input and output channel for an existing program and is sometimes
used in specialized applications. The option value specifies the last few
letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave mode, plus the
number of the inherited file descriptor. If the option contains a ``/'' character,
that delimits the characters used for the pseudo-terminal name from the
file descriptor. Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option
for the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor. Examples:
<br>
<pre>-S123/45
-Sab34
</pre></dl>
<p>
Note that <i>xterm</i> does not close any file descriptor which it did not open
for its own use. It is possible (though probably not portable) to have an
application which passes an open file descriptor down to <i>xterm</i> past the
initialization or the <b>-S</b> option to a process running in the <i>xterm</i>. <p>
The following
command line arguments are provided for compatibility with older versions.
They may not be supported in the next release as the X Toolkit provides
standard options that accomplish the same task. 
<dl>

<dt><b>%<i>geom</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies
the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window. It is shorthand
for specifying the ``<i>*tekGeometry</i>'' resource. </dd>

<dt><b>&nbsp;#<i>geom</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the
preferred position of the icon window. It is shorthand for specifying the
``<i>*iconGeometry</i>'' resource. </dd>

<dt><b>-T</b><i> string</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the title for <i>xterm</i>'s
windows. It is equivalent to <b>-title</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-n</b><i> string</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the icon
name for <i>xterm</i>'s windows. It is shorthand for specifying the ``<i>*iconName</i>'' resource.
Note that this is not the same as the toolkit option <b>-name</b> (see below). The
default icon name is the application name. </dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that
reverse video should be simulated by swapping the foreground and background
colors. It is equivalent to <b>-rv</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-w</b><i> number</i> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the width
in pixels of the border surrounding the window. It is equivalent to <b>-borderwidth</b>
or <b>-bw</b>. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly
used with <i>xterm</i>: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-bd <i>color</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the color to use for the
border of the window. <i>xterm</i> uses the X Toolkit default, which is ``XtDefaultForeground''.
</dd>

<dt><b>-bg <i>color</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the color to use for the background of the
window. The default is ``XtDefaultBackground.'' </dd>

<dt><b>-bw <i>number</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies
the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window. </dd>

<dt><b>-display <i>display</i></b>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the X server to contact; see <a href='X.7.html'><i>X(7)</i></a>
. </dd>

<dt><b>-fg <i>color</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option
specifies the color to use for displaying text. The default is ``XtDefaultForeground.''
</dd>

<dt><b>-fn <i>font</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal
text. The default is <i>fixed</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>-font <i>font</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This is the same as <b>-fn</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-geometry <i>geometry</i></b>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102 window;
see <a href='X.7.html'><i>X(7)</i></a>
. </dd>

<dt><b>-iconic</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should ask the window
manager to start it as an icon rather than as the normal window. </dd>

<dt><b>-name <i>name</i></b>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the application name under which resources are to
be obtained, rather than the default executable file name. <i>Name</i> should not
contain ``.'' or ``*'' characters. </dd>

<dt><b>-rv</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that reverse video should
be simulated by swapping the foreground and background colors. </dd>

<dt><b>+rv</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable
the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background colors.
</dd>

<dt><b>-title <i>string</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the window title string, which may be
displayed by window managers if the user so chooses. The default title is
the command line specified after the <b>-e</b> option, if any, otherwise the application
name. </dd>

<dt><b>-xrm <i>resourcestring</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies a resource string to be used.
This is especially useful for setting resources that do not have separate
command line options. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Resources</a></h2>
The program understands all of the core X
Toolkit resource names and classes. Application specific resources (e.g.,
"<b>XTerm.</b><i>NAME</i>") follow: 
<dl>

<dt><b>backarrowKeyIsErase (class<b> BackarrowKeyIsErase)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Tie
the VTxxx <b>backarrowKey</b> and <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resources together by setting
the DECBKM state according to whether the initial value of stty erase is
a <a href='backspace.8.html'>backspace (8)</a>
 or delete (127) character. The default is ``false'', which disables
this feature. </dd>

<dt><b>hold (class<b> Hold)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If true, <i>xterm</i> will not immediately destroy
its window when the shell command completes. It will wait until you use
the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the menu entries
that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL. You may scroll back, select text, etc.,
to perform most graphical operations. Resizing the display will lose data,
however, since this involves interaction with the shell which is no longer
running. </dd>

<dt><b>hpFunctionKeys (class<b> HpFunctionKeys)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not
HP Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys instead
of standard escape sequences. See also the <b>keyboardType</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>iconGeometry
(class<b> IconGeometry)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the preferred size and position of the application
when iconified. It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers. </dd>

<dt><b>iconName
(class<b> IconName)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the icon name. The default is the application
name. </dd>

<dt><b>keyboardType (class<b> KeyboardType)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Enables one (or none) of the various
keyboard-type resources: <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>, <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>, <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>
and <b>sunKeyboard</b>. The resource's value should be one of the corresponding
strings hp, sco, sun or vt220. The individual resources are provided for
legacy support; this resource is simpler to use. </dd>

<dt><b>maxBufSize (class<b> MaxBufSize)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specify the maximum size of the input buffer. The default is 32768. You cannot
set this to a value less than the <b>minBufSize</b> resource. It will be increased
as needed to make that value evenly divide this one. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
On some systems you
may want to increase one or both of the <b>maxBufSize</b> and <b>minBufSize</b> resource
values to achieve better performance if the operating system prefers larger
buffer sizes. 
<dl>

<dt><b>messages (class<b> Messages)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether write access to
the terminal is allowed initially. See <a href='mesg.1.html'><b>mesg</b>(1)</a>
. The default is ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>minBufSize
(class<b> MinBufSize)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specify the minimum size of the input buffer, i.e., the
amount of data that <i>xterm</i> requests on each read. The default is 4096. You
cannot set this to a value less than 64. </dd>

<dt><b>ptyHandshake (class<b> PtyHandshake)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>If ``true'', <i>xterm</i> will perform handshaking during initialization to ensure
that the parent and child processes update the <b>utmp</b> and <b>stty</b> state. The
default is ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>ptyInitialErase (class<b> PtyInitialErase)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true'', <i>xterm</i>
will use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the stty erase value. If ``false'', <i>xterm</i>
will set the stty erase value to match its own configuration, using the
<b>kb</b> string from the termcap entry as a reference, if available. In either
case, the result is applied to the TERMCAP variable which <i>xterm</i> sets. The
default is ``false''. </dd>

<dt><b>sameName (class<b> SameName)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If the value of this resource
is ``true'', <i>xterm</i> does not send title and icon name change requests when the
request would have no effect: the name is not changed. This has the advantage
of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round
trip to the server to find out the previous value. In practice this should
never be a problem. The default is ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>scoFunctionKeys (class<b> ScoFunctionKeys)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not SCP Function Key escape codes should be generated
for function keys instead of standard escape sequences. See also the <b>keyboardType</b>
resource. </dd>

<dt><b>sessionMgt (class<b> SessionMgt)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If the value of this resource is
``true'', <i>xterm</i> sets up session manager callbacks for <b>XtNdieCallback</b> and <b>XtNsaveCallback</b>.
The default is ``true''. </dd>

<dt><b>sunFunctionKeys (class<b> SunFunctionKeys)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
or not Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys
instead of standard escape sequences. See also the <b>keyboardType</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>sunKeyboard (class<b> SunKeyboard)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard
layout should be assumed rather than DEC VT220. This causes the keypad `+'
to be mapped to `,'. and CTRL F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of
the <b>ctrlFKeys</b> resource. so <i>xterm</i> emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately. Otherwise
(the default, with <b>sunKeyboard</b> set to ``false''), <i>xterm</i> uses PC-style bindings
for the function keys and keypad. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
PC-style bindings use the Shift, Alt, Control
and Meta keys as modifiers for function-keys and keypad (see the document
<i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> for details). The PC-style bindings are analogous
to PCTerm, but not the same thing. Normally these bindings do not conflict
with the use of the Meta key as described for the <b>eightBitInput</b> resource.
If they do, note that the PC-style bindings are evaluated first. See also
the <b>keyboardType</b> resource. 
<dl>

<dt><b>termName (class<b> TermName)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the terminal
type name to be set in the TERM environment variable. </dd>

<dt><b>title (class<b> Title)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies a string that may be used by the window manager when displaying
this application. </dd>

<dt><b>toolBar (class<b> ToolBar)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the toolbar
should be displayed. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>ttyModes (class<b> TtyModes)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies
a string containing terminal setting keywords and the characters to which
they may be bound. Allowable keywords include: brk, dsusp, eof, eol, eol2,
erase, erase2, flush, intr, kill, lnext, quit, rprnt, start, status, stop,
susp, swtch and weras. Control characters may be specified as ^char (e.g.,
^c or ^u) and <b>^?</b> may be used to indicate delete (127). Use <b>^-</b> to denote <i>undef</i>.
Use <b>\034</b> to represent <b>^\</b>, since a literal backslash in an X resource escapes
the next character. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
This is very useful for overriding the default terminal
settings without having to do an <i>stty</i> every time an <i>xterm</i> is started. Note,
however, that the stty program on a given host may use different keywords;
<i>xterm</i>'s table is built-in. 
<dl>

<dt><b>useInsertMode (class<b> UseInsertMode)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Force use of
insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP environment variable.
This is useful if the system termcap is broken. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>utmpDisplayId
(class<b> UtmpDisplayId)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should try to record
the display identifier (display number and screen number) as well as the
hostname in the system <i>utmp</i> log file. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>utmpInhibit (class<b>
UtmpInhibit)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should try to record the user's
terminal in the system <i>utmp</i> log file. If true, <i>xterm</i> will not try. The default
is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>waitForMap (class<b> WaitForMap)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should
wait for the initial window map before starting the subprocess. The default
is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>zIconBeep (class<b> ZIconBeep)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Same as -ziconbeep command line argument.
If the value of this resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output while
iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume and have "***"
prepended to their icon titles. Most window managers will detect this change
immediately, showing you which window has the output. (A similar feature
was in x10 <i>xterm</i>.) The default is ``false.'' </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following resources are specified
as part of the <i>vt100</i> widget (class <i>VT100</i>): These are specified by patterns
such as "<b>XTerm.vt100.</b><i>NAME</i>": 
<dl>

<dt><b>activeIcon (class<b> ActiveIcon)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
or not active icon windows are to be used when the <i>xterm</i> window is iconified,
if this feature is compiled into <i>xterm</i>. The active icon is a miniature representation
of the content of the window and will update as the content changes. Not
all window managers necessarily support application icon windows. Some window
managers will allow you to enter keystrokes into the active icon window.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>allowC1Printable (class<b> AllowC1Printable)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If true,
overrides the mapping of C1 controls (codes 128-159) to make them be treated
as if they were printable characters. Although this corresponds to no particular
standard, some users insist it is a VT100. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>allowSendEvents
(class<b> AllowSendEvents)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button
events (generated using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be interpreted
or discarded. The default is ``false'' meaning they are discarded. Note that
allowing such events creates a very large security hole. The default is
``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>allowWindowOps (class<b> AllowWindowOps)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether extended
window control sequences (as used in dtterm) for should be allowed. The
default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>alwaysHighlight (class<b> AlwaysHighlight)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
or not <i>xterm</i> should always display a highlighted text cursor. By default
(if this resource is false), a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever
the pointer moves out of the window or the window loses the input focus.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>alwaysUseMods (class<b> AlwaysUseMods)</b> </b></dt>

parameters for function key sequences even if those modifiers appear in
the translations resource. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>answerbackString (class<b>
AnswerbackString)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the string that <i>xterm</i> sends in response to
an ENQ (control/E) character from the host. The default is a blank string,
i.e., ``''. A hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup option. </dd>

<dt><b>appcursorDefault
(class<b> AppcursorDefault)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true,'' the cursor keys are initially in application
mode. This is the same as the VT102 private DECCKM mode, The default is
``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>appkeypadDefault (class<b> AppkeypadDefault)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true,'' the keypad keys
are initially in application mode. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>autoWrap (class<b>

<dd>Specifies whether or not auto-wraparound should be enabled. This
is the same as the VT102 DECAWM. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>awaitInput (class<b> AwaitInput)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the <i>xterm</i> uses a 50 millisecond timeout to await
input (i.e., to support the Xaw3d arrow scrollbar). The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>backarrowKey
(class<b> BackarrowKey)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits a <a href='backspace.8.html'>backspace
(8)</a>
 or delete (127) character. This corresponds to the DECBKM control sequence.
The default (backspace) is ``true.'' Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.
</dd>

<dt><b>background (class<b> Background)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the color to use for the background
of the window. The default is ``XtDefaultBackground.'' </dd>

<dt><b>bellOnReset (class<b> BellOnReset)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset. The default is
``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>bellSuppressTime (class<b> BellSuppressTime)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Number of milliseconds after
a bell command is sent during which additional bells will be suppressed.
Default is 200. If set non-zero, additional bells will also be suppressed
until the server reports that processing of the first bell has been completed;
this feature is most useful with the visible bell. </dd>

<dt><b>boldColors (class<b> ColorMode)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC,
i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15. These normally are the
brighter versions of the first 8 colors, hence bold. The default is ``true.''
</dd>

<dt><b>boldFont (class<b> BoldFont)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead
of overstriking. There is no default for this resource. </dd>

<dt><b>boldMode (class<b> BoldMode)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should be overstruck
to simulate bold fonts if the resolved bold font is the same as the normal
font. It may be desirable to disable bold fonts when color is being used
for the bold attribute. Note that <i>xterm</i> has one bold font which you may
set explicitly. It attempts to match a bold font for the other font selections
(<b>font1</b> through <b>font6</b>). If the normal and bold fonts are distinct, this resource
has no effect. The default is ``true.'' </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Although <i>xterm</i> attempts to match a bold
font for other font selections, the font server may not cooperate. Since
X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled. The font server claims to provide
the bold font that <i>xterm</i> requests, but the result is not always readable.
XFree86 provides a feature which can be used to suppress the scaling. In
the X server's configuration file (e.g., "/etc/X11/XFree86"), you can add
":unscaled" to the end of the directory specification for the "misc" fonts,
which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by <i>xterm</i>. For example
<dl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"<br>
 </dl>
</dl>
<p>
would become <dl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"<br>
 </dl>
</dl>
<p>
Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its own configuration
file. The same ":unscaled" can be added to its configuration file at the
end of the directory specification for "misc".

<dt><b>cursorBlink (class<b> CursorBlink)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to make the cursor blink. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>cursorColor
(class<b> CursorColor)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the color to use for the text cursor. The
default is ``XtDefaultForeground.'' <i>Xterm</i> attempts to keep this color from being
the same as the background color, since it draws the cursor by filling
the background of a text cell. The same restriction applies to control sequences

<dt><b>eightBitControl (class<b> EightBitControl</b>)</b> </dt>
<dd>Specifies
whether or not control sequences sent by the terminal should be eight-bit
characters or escape sequences. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>eightBitInput (class<b>
EightBitInput</b>)</b> </dt>
<dd>If ``true'', Meta characters (a single-byte character combined
with the <i>keys</i> modifier key) input from the keyboard are presented as a
single character with the eighth bit turned on. The terminal is put into
8-bit mode. If ``false'', Meta characters are converted into a two-character sequence
with the character itself preceded by ESC. On startup, <i>xterm</i> tries to put
the terminal into 7-bit mode. The <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource may override this.
The default is ``true.'' </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled "Meta",
but "Alt" keys are common, and they are conventionally used for "Meta".
If they were synonymous, it would have been reasonable to name this resource
"altSendsEscape", reversing its sense. For more background on this, see
the <b>meta</b> function in curses. </dl>
<p>
Note that the <i>Alt</i> key is not necessarily the
same as the <i>Meta</i> modifier. <i>xmodmap</i> lists your key modifiers. X defines modifiers
for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well as 5 additional modifiers which
are generally used to configure key modifiers. <i>xterm</i> inspects the same information
to find the modifier associated with either <i>Meta</i> key (left or right), and
uses that key as the <i>Meta</i> modifier. It also looks for the NumLock key, to
recognize the modifier which is associated with that. </dl>
<p>
If your <i>xmodmap</i> configuration
uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys, <i>xterm</i> will only see the Alt-key
definitions, since those are tested before Meta-keys. NumLock is tested first.
It is important to keep these keys distinct; otherwise some of <i>xterm</i>'s functionality
is not available. 
<dl>

<dt><b>eightBitOutput (class<b> EightBitOutput</b>)</b> </dt>

for both normal and bold fonts, <i>xterm</i> uses the <b>font</b> and related resources.
</dd>

<dt><b>faceNameDoublesize (class<b> FaceNameDoublesize)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specify an double-width font

<dt>- </dt>
<dd>The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded

<p>
If ``false'',
<i>xterm</i> checks for missing glyphs in the font and makes line-drawing characters

</dl>
<p>
Depending on the way your applications write to the
screen, there may be trailing blanks on a line. <i>Xterm</i> stores data as it
is shown on the screen. Erasing the display changes the internal state of
each cell so it is not considered a blank for the purpose of selection.
Blanks written since the last erase are selectable. If you do not wish to

The resource value (ignoring case) may be: <dl></dd>

<dt><i>true</i> </dt>
<dd><i>xterm</i> will use the encoding

as far as possible. This is realized by always enabling UTF-8 mode and invoking
<i>luit</i> in non-UTF-8 locales. </dd>

<dt><i>medium</i> </dt>
<dd><i>xterm</i> will follow users' LC_CTYPE locale
only for UTF-8, east Asian, and Thai locales, where the encodings were not

<i>xterm</i> will use conventional 8bit mode. </dd>

<dt><i>checkfont</i> </dt>
<dd>If mini-luit is compiled-in,
<i>xterm</i> will check if a Unicode font has been specified. If so, it checks
if the character encoding for the current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or Latin-9,
uses the appropriate mapping to support those with the Unicode font. For
other encodings, <i>xterm</i> assumes that UTF-8 encoding is required. </dd>

<dt><i>false</i> </dt>

<p>
Any other value, e.g., ``UTF-8'' or ``ISO8859-2'', is assumed to be an

list of supported encodings depends on <i>luit</i>. The default is ``medium''. </dl>
<p>
Regardless
of your locale and encoding, you need an ISO-10646-1 font to display the
result. Your configuration may not include this font, or locale-support by
<i>xterm</i> may not be needed. At startup, <i>xterm</i> uses a mechanism equivalent to
the <b>load-vt-fonts(utf8Fonts,&nbsp;Utf8Fonts)</b> action to load font name subresources
of the VT100 widget. That is, resource patterns such as "<b>*vt100.utf8Fonts.font</b>"
will be loaded, and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal
fonts. If no subresources are found, the normal fonts such as "<b>*vt100.font</b>",

whether or not the bell should be rung when the user types near the right
margin. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>metaSendsEscape (class<b> MetaSendsEscape</b>)</b> </dt>
<dd>If
``true'', Meta characters (a character combined with the <i>Meta</i> modifier key)
are converted into a two-character sequence with the character itself preceded
by ESC. This applies as well to function key control sequences, unless <i>xterm</i>
sees that <b>Meta</b> is used in your key translations. If ``false'', Meta characters
input from the keyboard are handled according to the <b>eightBitInput</b> resource.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>mkWidth (class<b> MkWidth)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should
use a built-in version of the wide character width calculation. The default
is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>modifyCursorKeys (class<b> ModifyCursorKeys</b>)</b> </dt>
<dd>Tells how to handle
the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to
add a parameter to the escape sequence returned by a cursor-key. The default
is ``2'': </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Set it to 0 to use the old/obsolete behavior. <br>
Set it to 1 to prefix modified sequences with CSI. <br>
Set it to 2 to force the modifier to be the second parameter. <br>
Set it to 3 to mark the sequence with a '&gt;' to hint that it is private. 
<dl>

<dt><b>modifyOtherKeys
(class<b> ModifyOtherKeys</b>)</b> </dt>
<dd>Like <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>, tells <i>xterm</i> to construct
an escape sequence for other keys (such as "2") when modified by Control-,
Alt- or Meta-modifiers. This feature does not apply to function keys and well-defined
keys such as ESC or the control keys. The default is ``0'': </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Set it to 0 to disable
this feature. <br>
Set it to 1 to enable this feature for keys except Tab and some special
control character cases, e.g., Control-Space to make a NUL. <br>
Set it to 1 to enable this feature for keys including the exceptions listed.

<dl>

<dt><b>multiClickTime (class<b> MultiClickTime)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds
between multi-click select events. The default is 250 milliseconds. </dd>

<dt><b>multiScroll
(class<b> MultiScroll)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not scrolling should be done asynchronously.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>nMarginBell (class<b> Column)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of
characters from the right margin at which the margin bell should be rung,
when enabled. </dd>

<dt><b>numLock (class<b> NumLock)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true'', <i>xterm</i> checks if NumLock is
used as a modifier (see <a href='xmodmap.1.html'><i>xmodmap</i>(1)</a>
). If so, this modifier is used to simplify
the logic when implementing special NumLock for the <b>sunKeyboard</b> resource.
Also (when <b>sunKeyboard</b> is false), similar logic is used to find the modifier
associated with the left and right Alt keys. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>oldXtermFKeys
(class<b> OldXtermFKeys)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true'', <i>xterm</i> will use old-style control sequences
for function keys F1 to F4, for compatibility with X Consortium <i>xterm</i>. Otherwise,
it uses the VT100-style codes for PF1 to PF4. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>on2Clicks
(class<b> On2Clicks)</b> </b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>on3Clicks (class<b> On3Clicks)</b> </b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>on4Clicks (class<b> On4Clicks)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>on5Clicks (class<b> On5Clicks)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specify selection behavior in response to multiple
mouse clicks. A single mouse click is always interpreted as described in
the <b>SELECTION</b> section (see <b>POINTER USAGE</b>). Multiple mouse clicks (using
the button which activates the <b>select-start</b> action) are interpreted according
to the resource values of <b>on2Clicks</b>, etc. The resource value can be one
of these: <dl></dd>

<dt>word </dt>
<dd>Select a ``word'' as determined by the <b>charClass</b> resource. See
the <b>CHARACTER CLASSES</b> section. </dd>

<dt>line </dt>
<dd>Select a line (counting wrapping). </dd>

<dt>group
</dt>
<dd>Select a group of adjacent lines (counting wrapping). The selection stops
on a blank line. </dd>

<dt>page </dt>
<dd>Select all visible lines, i.e., the page. </dd>

<dt>all </dt>
<dd>Select
all lines, i.e., including the saved lines. </dd>

<dt>regex </dt>
<dd>Select a ``word'' as determined
by the regular expression which follows in the resource value. </dd>

<dt>none </dt>
<dd>No selection
action is associated with this resource. <i>xterm</i> interprets it as the end
of the list. For example, you may use it to disable triple (and higher)
clicking by setting <b>on3Clicks</b> to ``none''. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<p>
The default values for <b>on2Clicks</b>
and <b>on3Clicks</b> are ``word'' and ``line'', respectively. There is no default value
for <b>on4Clicks</b> or <b>on5Clicks</b>, making those inactive. On startup, <i>xterm</i> determines
the maximum number of clicks by the <b>on</b><i>X</i><b>Clicks</b> resource values which are
set. 
<dl>

<dt><b>pointerColor (class<b> PointerColor)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the foreground color of
the pointer. The default is ``XtDefaultForeground.'' </dd>

<dt><b>pointerColorBackground (class<b>

<dd>Specifies the background color of the pointer. The
default is ``XtDefaultBackground.'' </dd>

<dt><b>pointerShape (class<b> Cursor)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the
name of the shape of the pointer. The default is ``xterm.'' </dd>

<dt><b>popOnBell (class<b>
PopOnBell)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether the window would be raised when Control-G is
received. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>printAttributes (class<b> PrintAttributes)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies
whether to print graphic attributes along with the text. A real DEC VTxxx
terminal will print the underline, highlighting codes but your printer
may not handle these. A ``0'' disables the attributes. A ``1'' prints the normal
set of attributes (bold, underline, inverse and blink) as VT100-style control
sequences. A ``2'' prints ANSI color attributes as well. The default is ``1.'' </dd>

<dt><b>printerAutoClose
(class<b> PrinterAutoClose)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If ``true'', <i>xterm</i> will close the printer (a pipe)
when the application switches the printer offline with a Media Copy command.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>printerCommand (class<b> PrinterCommand)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies a
shell command to which <i>xterm</i> will open a pipe when the first MC (Media
Copy) command is initiated. The default is a blank string. If the resource
value is given as a blank string, the printer is disabled. </dd>

<dt><b>printerControlMode
(class<b> PrinterControlMode)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the printer control mode. A ``1'' selects
autoprint mode, which causes <i>xterm</i> to print a line from the screen when
you move the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed or vertical
tab character, or an autowrap occurs. Autoprint mode is overridden by printer
controller mode (a ``2''), which causes all of the output to be directed to
the printer. The default is ``0.'' </dd>

<dt><b>printerExtent (class<b> PrinterExtent)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Controls
whether a print page function will print the entire page (true), or only
the the portion within the scrolling margins (false). The default is ``false.''
</dd>

<dt><b>printerFormFeed (class<b> PrinterFormFeed)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Controls whether a form feed is
sent to the printer at the end of a print page function. The default is
``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>renderFont (class<b> RenderFont)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If <i>xterm</i> is built with the Xft library,
this controls whether the <b>faceName</b> resource is used. The default is ``true.''
</dd>

<dt><b>resizeGravity (class<b> ResizeGravity)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Affects the behavior when the window
is resized to be taller or shorter. <b>NorthWest</b> specifies that the top line
of text on the screen stay fixed. If the window is made shorter, lines are
dropped from the bottom; if the window is made taller, blank lines are
added at the bottom. This is compatible with the behavior in R4. <b>SouthWest</b>
(the default) specifies that the bottom line of text on the screen stay
fixed. If the window is made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled
down onto the screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled
off the top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped. </dd>

<dt><b>reverseVideo
(class<b> ReverseVideo)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>reverseWrap (class<b> ReverseWrap)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
or not reverse-wraparound should be enabled. This corresponds to <i>xterm</i>'s private
mode 45. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>rightScrollBar (class<b> RightScrollBar)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies
whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed on the right rather than
the left. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>saveLines (class<b> SaveLines)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the
number of lines to save beyond the top of the screen when a scrollbar is
turned on. The default is 64. </dd>

<dt><b>scrollBar (class<b> ScrollBar)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
or not the scrollbar should be displayed. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>scrollBarBorder
(class<b> ScrollBarBorder)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the width of the scrollbar border. Note
that this is drawn to overlap the border of the <i>xterm</i> window. Modifying
the scrollbar's border affects only the line between the VT100 widget and
the scrollbar. The default value is 1. </dd>

<dt><b>scrollKey (class<b> ScrollCond)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies
whether or not pressing a key should automatically cause the scrollbar
to go to the bottom of the scrolling region. This corresponds to <i>xterm</i>'s
private mode 1011. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>scrollLines (class<b> ScrollLines)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of lines that the <i>scroll-back</i> and <i>scroll-forw</i> actions
should use as a default. The default value is 1. </dd>

<dt><b>scrollTtyOutput (class<b> ScrollCond)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not output to the terminal should automatically cause
the scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling region. The default is
``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>selectToClipboard (class<b> SelectToClipboard)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to
use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for SELECT tokens in the selection mechanism.
The <b>set-select</b> action can change this at runtime, allowing the user to work
with programs that handle only one of these mechanisms. The default is ``false'',
which tells it to use PRIMARY. </dd>

<dt><b>shiftFonts (class<b> ShiftFonts)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether
to enable the actions <b>larger-vt-font()</b> and <b>smaller-vt-font()</b>, which are normally
bound to the shifted KP_Add and KP_Subtract. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>showBlinkAsBold
(class<b> ShowBlinkAsBold)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to display text with blink-attribute
the same as bold. If <i>xterm</i> has not been configured to support blinking text,
the default is ``true.'', which corresponds to older versions of <i>xterm</i>, otherwise
the default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>showMissingGlyphs (class<b> ShowMissingGlyphs)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Tells
<i>xterm</i> whether to display a box outlining places where a character has been
used that the font does not represent. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>signalInhibit
(class<b> SignalInhibit)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the entries in the ``Main
Options'' menu for sending signals to <i>xterm</i> should be disallowed. The default
is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>tekGeometry (class<b> Geometry)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the preferred size and
position of the Tektronix window. There is no default for this resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>tekInhibit (class<b> TekInhibit)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the escape sequence
to enter Tektronix mode should be ignored. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>tekSmall
(class<b> TekSmall)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the Tektronix mode window should
start in its smallest size if no explicit geometry is given. This is useful
when running <i>xterm</i> on displays with small screens. The default is ``false.''
</dd>

<dt><b>tekStartup (class<b> TekStartup)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should start
up in Tektronix mode. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>tiXtraScroll (class<b> TiXtraScroll)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should scroll to a new page when processing the
<i>ti</i> termcap entry, i.e., the private modes 47, 1047 or 1049. This is only in
effect if <b>titeInhibit</b> is ``true'', because the intent of this option is to
provide a picture of the full-screen application's display on the scrollback
without wiping out the text that would be shown before the application
was initialized. The default for this resource is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>titeInhibit (class<b>
TiteInhibit)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should remove <i>ti</i> and <i>te</i> termcap
entries (used to switch between alternate screens on startup of many screen-oriented
programs) from the TERMCAP string. If set, <i>xterm</i> also ignores the escape
sequence to switch to the alternate screen. <i>Xterm</i> supports terminfo in a
different way, supporting composite control sequences (also known as private
modes) 1047, 1048 and 1049 which have the same effect as the original 47
control sequence. The default for this resource is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>translations (class<b>
Translations)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the key and button bindings for menus, selections,
``programmed strings,'' etc. The <b>translations</b> resource, which provides much
of <i>xterm</i>'s configurability, is a feature of the X Toolkit Intrinsics library
(Xt). See the <b>ACTIONS</b> section. </dd>

<dt><b>trimSelection (class<b> TrimSelection)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If you
set <b>highlightSelection</b>, you can see the text which is selected, including
any trailing spaces. Clearing the screen (or a line) resets it to a state
containing no spaces. Some lines may contain trailing spaces when an application
writes them to the screen. However, you may not wish to paste lines with
trailing spaces. If this resource is true, <i>xterm</i> will trim trailing spaces
from text which is selected. It does not affect spaces which result in a
wrapped line, nor will it trim the trailing newline from your selection.
The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>underLine (class<b> UnderLine)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This specifies whether
or not text with the underline attribute should be underlined. It may be
desirable to disable underlining when color is being used for the underline
attribute. The default is ``true.'' </dd>

<dt><b>utf8 (class<b> Utf8)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This specifies whether
<i>xterm</i> will run in UTF-8 mode. If you set this resource, <i>xterm</i> also sets the
<b>wideChars</b> resource as a side-effect. The resource is an integer, expected
to range from 0 to 3: <dl></li><li>UTF-8 mode is initially off. The command-line option
<b>+u8</b> sets the resource to this value. Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode
on/off are allowed. </li><li>UTF-8 mode is initially on. Escape sequences for turning
UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed. </li><li>The command-line option <b>-u8</b> sets the resource
to this value. Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are ignored.
</li><li>This is the default value of the resource. It is changed during initialization
depending on whether the <b>locale</b> resource was set, to 0 or 2. See the <b>locale</b>
resource for additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales. </li>
</ol>
</dl>

</ol>
<p>
If you want to set
the value of <b>utf8</b>, it should be in this range. Other nonzero values are
treated the same as ``1'', i.e., UTF-8 mode is initially on, and escape sequences
for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed. 
<dl>

<dt><b>utf8Fonts (class<b> Utf8Fonts)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>See
the discussion of the <b>locale</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>utf8Latin1 (class<b> Utf8Latin1)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>If
true, allow an ISO-8859-1 <i>normal</i> font to be combined with an ISO-10646 font
if the latter is given via the <b>-fw</b> option or its corresponding resource
value. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>utf8Title (class<b> Utf8Title)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Applications can
set <i>xterm</i>'s title by writing a control sequence. Normally this control sequence
follows the VT220 convention, which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and
allows for an 8-bit string terminator. If <i>xterm</i> is started in a UTF-8 locale,
it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X libraries
which assume the string is UTF-8. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
However, some users may wish to write a
title string encoded in UTF-8. Set this resource to ``true'' to allow UTF-8 encoded
title strings. That cancels the translation to UTF-8, allowing UTF-8 strings
to be displayed as is. </dl>
<p>
The default is ``false.'' 
<dl>

<dt><b>veryBoldColors (class<b> VeryBoldColors)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors specified by
<b>colorBD</b>, <b>colorBL</b>, <b>colorRV</b> and <b>colorUL</b>. The resource value is the sum of
values for each attribute: <dl><br>
<pre>1 for reverse,
2 for underline,
4 for bold and
8 for blink.
</pre></dd>
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<p>
The default is ``0.'' 
<dl>

<dt><b>visualBell (class<b> VisualBell)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not
a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should be used instead of an audible bell
when Control-G is received. The default is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>visualBellDelay (class<b> VisualBellDelay)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell. Default is
100. If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed. This is useful for very
slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a laptop. </dd>

<dt><b>vt100Graphics (class<b> VT100Graphics)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>This specifies whether <i>xterm</i> will interpret VT100 graphic character escape
sequences while in UTF-8 mode. The default is ``true'', to provide support for
various legacy applications. </dd>

<dt><b>wideBoldFont (class<b> WideBoldFont)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This option
specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text. By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used
to draw bold text. If no doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by
stretching the bold font. </dd>

<dt><b>wideChars (class<b> WideChars)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>Specifies if <i>xterm</i>
should respond to control sequences that process 16-bit characters. The default
is ``false.'' </dd>

<dt><b>wideFont (class<b> WideFont)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This option specifies the font to be
used for displaying wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a font
twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text. If no doublewidth
font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font. </dd>

<dt><b>ximFont
(class<b> XimFont)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This option specifies the font to be used for displaying
the preedit string in the "OverTheSpot" input method. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In "OverTheSpot" preedit
type, the preedit (preconversion) string is displayed at the position of
the cursor. It is the XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit
string. The XIM client must inform the XIM server of the cursor position.
For best results, the preedit string must be displayed with a proper font.
Therefore, <i>xterm</i> informs the XIM server of the proper font. The font is
be supplied by a "fontset", whose default value is "*". This matches every
font, the X library automatically chooses fonts with proper charsets. The
<b>ximFont</b> resource is provided to override this default font setting. <p>
The
following resources are specified as part of the <i>tek4014</i> widget (class
<i>Tek4014</i>). These are specified by patterns such as "<b>XTerm.tek4014.</b><i>NAME</i>":

</dl>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Pointer Usage</a></h2>
<p>
Once the VT102
window is created, <i>xterm</i> allows you to select text and copy it within the
same or other windows. 
<h3><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Selection</a></h3>
<p>
The selection functions are invoked when
the pointer buttons are used with no modifiers, and when they are used
with the ``shift'' key. The assignment of the functions described below to keys
and buttons may be changed through the resource database; see <b>ACTIONS</b> below.
<p>
Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut buffer.
Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the button down
while moving the cursor to the end of the region and releasing the button.
The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer
and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is released. Normally (but
see the discussion of <b>on2Clicks</b>, etc): <dl>
<dl>

<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Double-clicking selects by words.
</dd>

<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Triple-clicking selects by lines. </dd>

<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters,
etc. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>
<p>
Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to button down,
so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection. Logical
words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap across more
than one screen line if lines were wrapped by <i>xterm</i> itself rather than
by the application running in the window. If the key/button bindings specify
that an X selection is to be made, <i>xterm</i> will leave the selected text highlighted
for as long as it is the selection owner. <p>
Pointer button two (usually middle)
`types' (pastes) the text from the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from
the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input. <p>
Pointer button three (usually
right) extends the current selection. (Without loss of generality, you can
swap ``right'' and ``left'' everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.)  If pressed
while closer to the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts
the right edge of the selection. If you contract the selection past the
left edge of the selection, <i>xterm</i> assumes you really meant the left edge,
restores the original selection, then extends/contracts the left edge of
the selection. Extension starts in the selection unit mode that the last
selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to cycle
through them. <p>
By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new
lines, you can take text from several places in different windows and form
a command to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and
insert it into your favorite editor. Since cut buffers are globally shared
among different applications, you may regard each as a `file' whose contents
you know. The terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating
it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines. 
<h3><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Scrolling</a></h3>
<p>
The
scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing
in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved.
As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted
area decreases. <p>
Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region
moves the adjacent line to the top of the display window. <p>
Clicking button
three moves the top line of the display window down to the pointer position.
<p>
Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text that
corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar. 
<h3><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Tektronix Pointer</a></h3>
<p>
Unlike
the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of text.
It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode the cursor will change
from an arrow to a cross. Pressing any key will send that key and the current
coordinate of the cross cursor. Pressing button one, two, or three will
return the letters `l', `m', and `r', respectively. If the `shift' key is pressed
when a pointer button is pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is
sent. To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character
is set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is
RAW; see <a href='tty.4.html'><i>tty</i>(4)</a>
 for details). 
<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Menus</a></h2>
<p>
<i>Xterm</i> has four menus, named <i>mainMenu</i>,
<i>vtMenu</i>, <i>fontMenu</i>, and <i>tekMenu</i>. Each menu pops up under the correct combinations
of key and button presses. Each menu is divided into sections, separated
by a horizontal line. Some menu entries correspond to modes that can be
altered. A check mark appears next to a mode that is currently active. Selecting
one of these modes toggles its state. Other menu entries are commands; selecting
one of these performs the indicated function. <p>
All of the menu entries correspond
to X actions. In the list below, the menu label is shown followed by the
action's name in parenthesis. 
<!--
  ************************************************************************
 
-->

<h3><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>Main Options</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>xterm</i> <i>mainMenu</i> pops up when
the ``control'' key and pointer button one are pressed in a window. This menu
contains items that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows. There
are several sections: 
<dl>

<dt>Commands for managing X events: </dt>
<dd><dl></dd>

<dt>Toolbar </dt>
<dd>Clicking
on the "Toolbar" menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible, and shows
it if it is not. </dd>

<dt>Secure Keyboard (securekbd) </dt>
<dd>The <b>Secure Keyboard</b> mode is
helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an unsecure
environment; see <b>SECURITY</b> below (but read the limitations carefully). </dd>

<dt>Allow
SendEvents (allowsends ) </dt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button
events generated using the X protocol SendEvent request should be interpreted
or discarded. This corresponds to the <b>allowSendEvents</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Redraw Window
(redraw) </dt>
<dd>Forces the X display to repaint; useful in some environments. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Commands
for capturing output: </dt>
<dd><dl></dd>

<dt>Log to File (logging) </dt>
<dd>Captures text sent to the screen
in a logfile, as in the <b>-l</b> logging option. </dd>

<dt>Print Window (print) </dt>
<dd>Sends the
text of the current window to the program given in the <b>printerCommand</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt>Redirect to Printer (print-redir) </dt>
<dd>This sets the <b>printerControlMode</b> to 0
or 2. You can use this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
the appropriate control sequence. It is also useful for switching the printer
off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.
</dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Modes for setting keyboard style: </dt>
<dd><dl></dd>

<dt>8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control) </dt>
<dd>Enabled for
VT220 emulation, this controls whether <i>xterm</i> will send 8-bit control sequences
rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls, e.g., sending a byte in the range
128-159 rather than the escape character followed by a second byte. <i>Xterm</i>
always interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit control sequences (see the document
<i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>). This corresponds to the <b>eightBitControl</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt>Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow&nbsp;key) </dt>
<dd>Modifies the behavior of the backarrow
key, making it transmit either a <a href='backspace.8.html'>backspace (8)</a>
 or delete (127) character.
This corresponds to the <b>backarrowKey</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
</dt>
<dd>Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers. This corresponds
to the <b>numLock</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc) </dt>
<dd>Controls whether <i>Meta</i>
keys are converted into a two-character sequence with the character itself
preceded by ESC. This corresponds to the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Delete
is DEL (delete-is-del) </dt>
<dd>Controls whether the Delete key on the editing keypad
should send DEL (127) or the VT220-style Remove escape sequence. This corresponds
to the <b>deleteIsDEL</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>HP Function-Keys
(hpFunctionKeys) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)
</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard) </dt>
<dd>These act as a radio-button, selecting one
style for the keyboard layout. It corresponds to more than one resource
setting: <b>sunKeyboard</b>, <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>, <b>scoFunctionKeys</b> and <b>hpFunctionKeys
</b>." </dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Commands for process signalling: </dt>
<dd><dl></dd>

<dt>Send STOP Signal (suspend) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Send CONT
Signal (continue) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dd></dd>

<dt>Send HUP Signal (hangup)
</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Send TERM Signal (terminate) </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Send KILL Signal (kill) </dt>
<dd>These send the SIGTSTP,
SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals respectively, to the
process group of the process running under <i>xterm</i> (usually the shell). The
<b>SIGCONT</b> function is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed
CTRL-Z, suspending the process. </dd>

<dt>Quit (quit) </dt>
<dd>Stop processing X events except
to support the <b>-hold</b> option, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the the process
group of the process running under <i>xterm</i> (usually the shell).</dd>
</dl>
 </dl>

<h3><a name='sect14' href='#toc14'>VT Fonts</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>fontMenu</i> pops up when when the
``control'' key and pointer button three are pressed in a window. It sets the
font used in the VT102 window, or modifies the way the font is specified
or displayed. There are three sections. <p>
The first section allows you to select
the font from a set of alternatives: <dl>
<dl>

<dt>Default (fontdefault) </dt>
<dd>Set the font
to the default, i.e., that given by the <b>*VT100.font</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Unreadable (font1)
</dt>
<dd>Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font1</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Tiny (font2) </dt>
<dd>Set
the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font2</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Small (font3) </dt>
<dd>Set the
font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font3</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Medium (font4) </dt>
<dd>Set the font
to that given by the <b>*VT100.font4</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Large (font5) </dt>
<dd>Set the font to
that given by the <b>*VT100.font5</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Huge (font6) </dt>
<dd>Set the font to that
given by the <b>*VT100.font6</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Escape Sequence </dt>
<dd>This allows you to set
the font last specified by the Set Font escape sequence (see the document
<i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>). </dd>

<dt>Selection (fontsel) </dt>
<dd>This allows you to set the
font specified the current selection as a font name (if the PRIMARY selection
is owned).</dd>
</dl>
 </dl>
<p>
The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:
<dl>
<dl>

<dt>Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing) </dt>
<dd>When set, tells <i>xterm</i> to draw
its own line-drawing characters. Otherwise it relies on the font containing
these. Compare to the <b>forceBoxChars</b> resource. </dd>

<dt>Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize)
</dt>
<dd>When set, <i>xterm</i> may ask the font server to produce scaled versions of the
normal font, for VT102 double-size characters. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>
<p>
The third section allows you
to modify the way it is specified: <dl>
<dl>

<h2><a name='sect16' href='#toc16'>Security</a></h2>
<p>
X environments
differ in their security consciousness. Most servers, run under <i>xdm</i>, are
capable of using a ``magic cookie'' authorization scheme that can provide a
reasonable level of security for many people. If your server is only using
a host-based mechanism to control access to the server (see <a href='xhost.1.html'><i>xhost(1)</i></a>
), then
if you enable access for a host and other users are also permitted to run
clients on that same host, it is possible that someone can run an application
which uses the basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities,
potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it in ways
that you might not anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard to itself
and sending events to your application's windows. This is true even with
the ``magic cookie'' authorization scheme. While the <b>allowSendEvents</b> provides
some protection against rogue applications tampering with your programs,
guarding against a snooper is harder. <p>
The possibility of an application
spying on your keystrokes is of particular concern when you want to type
in a password or other sensitive data. The best solution to this problem
is to use a better authorization mechanism than is provided by X. Given
all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard
input in <i>xterm</i>. <p>
The <i>xterm</i> menu (see <b>MENUS</b> above) contains a <b>Secure Keyboard</b>
entry which, when enabled, attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is
directed <i>only</i> to <i>xterm</i> (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request). When an
application prompts you for a password (or other sensitive data), you can
enable <b>Secure Keyboard</b> using the menu, type in the data, and then disable
<b>Secure Keyboard</b> using the menu again. This ensures that you know which window
is accepting your keystrokes. It cannot ensure that there are no processes
which have access to your X display that might be observing the keystrokes
as well. <p>
Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you
attempt to enable <b>Secure Keyboard</b> it may fail. In this case, the bell will
sound. If the <b>Secure Keyboard</b> succeeds, the foreground and background colors
will be exchanged (as if you selected the <b>Reverse Video</b> entry in the <b>Modes</b>
menu); they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode. If the colors
do <i>not</i> switch, then you should be <i>very</i> suspicious that you are being spoofed.
If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for
the password, it is safest to enter secure mode <i>before</i> the prompt gets
displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets displayed correctly (in
the new colors), to minimize the probability of spoofing. You can also bring
up the menu again and make sure that a check mark appears next to the entry.
<p>
<b>Secure Keyboard</b> mode will be disabled automatically if your <i>xterm</i> window
becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up a reparenting
window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration around the
window) while in <b>Secure Keyboard</b> mode. (This is a feature of the X protocol
not easily overcome.)  When this happens, the foreground and background
colors will be switched back and the bell will sound in warning. 
<h2><a name='sect17' href='#toc17'>Character
Classes</a></h2>
Clicking the left mouse button twice in rapid succession (double-clicking)
causes all characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation)
to be selected as a ``word''. Since different people have different preferences
for what should be selected (for example, should filenames be selected
as a whole or only the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden
through the use of the <b>charClass</b> (class <i>CharClass</i>) resource. <p>
This resource
is a series of comma-separated of <i>range</i>:<i>value</i> pairs. The <i>range</i> is either
a single number or <i>low</i>-<i>high</i> in the range of 0 to 65535, corresponding to
the code for the character or characters to be set. The <i>value</i> is arbitrary,
although the default table uses the character number of the first character
occurring in the set. When not in UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 bytes of
this table will be used. <p>
The default table starts as follows - <p>
 <br>
<pre>static int charClass[256] = {

  For example, the string ``33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48'' indicates that the
exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash, and ampersand characters
should be treated the same way as characters and numbers. This is useful
for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and filenames. 
<h2><a name='sect18' href='#toc18'>Actions</a></h2>
It
is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings
for input, by changing the <b>translations</b> resources for the vt100 or tek4014
widgets. Changing the <b>translations</b> resource for events other than key and
button events is not expected, and will cause unpredictable behavior. The
following actions are provided for use within the <i>vt100</i> or <i>tek4014</i> <b>translations</b>
resources: 
<dl>

<dt><b>allow-send-events(<i>on/off/toggle</i>)</b> </dt>
<dd>This action set or toggles the
<b>allowSendEvents</b> resource and is also invoked by the <b>allowsends</b> entry in
<i>mainMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>alt-sends-escape()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action toggles the state of the <b>eightBitInput</b>
resource. </dd>

<dt><b>bell([<i>percent</i>])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified
percentage above or below the base volume. </dd>

<dt><b>clear-saved-lines()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action
does <b>hard-reset()</b> (see below) and also clears the history of lines saved
off the top of the screen. It is also invoked from the <b>clearsavedlines</b> entry
in <i>vtMenu</i>. The effect is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.
</dd>

<dt><b>create-menu(<i>m/v/f/t</i>)</b> </dt>
<dd>This action creates one of the menus used by <i>xterm</i>,
if it has not been previously created. The parameter values are the menu
names: <i>mainMenu</i>, <i>vtMenu</i>, <i>fontMenu</i>, <i>tekMenu</i>, respectively. </dd>

<dt><b>dabbrev-expand()</b>
</dt>
<dd>Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the
screen and in the scrollback buffer for words starting with that abbreviation.
Repeating <b>dabbrev-expand()</b> several times in sequence searches for an alternative
expansion by looking farther back. Lack of more matches is signaled by a
<b>beep()</b>. Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is preceded by
a space) yield successively all previous words. Consecutive identical expansions
are ignored. The word here is defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
This feature partially emulates the behavior of `dynamic abbreviation' expansion
in Emacs (bound there to M-/). Here is a resource setting for <i>xterm</i> which
will do the same thing: <p>
 <br>
<pre>*VT100*translations:    #override \n\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt; /:dabbrev-expand()
</pre><p>
  </dd>

<dt><b>deiconify()</b> </dt>
<dd>Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.
</dd>

<dt><b>delete-is-del()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action toggles the state of the <b>deleteIsDEL</b> resource.
</dd>

<dt><b>dired-button()</b> </dt>
<dd>Handles a button event (other than press and release) by
echoing the event's position (i.e., character line and column) in the following
format: <p>
 ^X ESC G &lt;line+' '&gt; &lt;col+' '&gt;  </dd>

<dt><b>iconify()</b> </dt>
<dd>Iconifies the window. </dd>

<dt><b>hard-reset()</b>
</dt>
<dd>This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor
keys and clears the screen. It is also invoked from the <b>hardreset</b> entry
in <i>vtMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>ignore()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action ignores the event but checks for special
pointer position escape sequences. </dd>

<dt><b>insert()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action inserts the character
or string associated with the key that was pressed. </dd>

<dt><b>insert-eight-bit()</b> </dt>
<dd>This
action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string associated
with the key that was pressed. This only applies to single-byte values. The
exact action depends on the value of the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> and the <b>eightBitInput</b>
resources. The <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource is tested first. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The term "eight-bit"
is misleading: <i>xterm</i> checks if the key's value is less than 128. If so, <i>xterm</i>
adds 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit. Otherwise <i>xterm</i> sends an
ESC byte before the key. In other applications' documentation, that is referred
to as a "meta key". 
<dl>

<dt><b>insert-selection(<i>sourcename</i> [, ...])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action inserts
the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated by <i>sourcename</i>.
Sources are checked in the order given (case is significant) until one
is found. Commonly-used selections include: <i>PRIMARY</i>, <i>SECONDARY</i>, and <i>CLIPBOARD</i>.
Cut buffers are typically named <i>CUT_BUFFER0</i> through <i>CUT_BUFFER7</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>insert-seven-bit()</b>
</dt>
<dd>This action is a synonym for <b>insert()</b> The term "seven-bit" is misleading:
it only implies that <i>xterm</i> does not try to add 128 to the key's value as
in <b>insert-eight-bit()</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>interpret(<i>control-sequence</i>)</b> </dt>
<dd>Interpret the given control
sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to the host. This works by inserting
the control sequence at the front of the input buffer. Use "\" to escape
octal digits in the string. Xt does not allow you to put a null character
(i.e., "\000") in the string. </dd>

<dt><a href='keymap.n.html'><a href='keymap.n.html'><b>keymap(<i>name</i>)</b></a>
</a>
 </dt>
<dd>This action dynamically defines
a new translation table whose resource name is <i>name</i> with the suffix <i>Keymap</i>
(case is significant). The name <i>None</i> restores the original translation table.
</dd>

<dt><b>larger-vt-font()</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.
See also <b>set-vt-font()</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>load-vt-fonts(<i>name</i>[,<i>class</i>])</b> </dt>
<dd>Load fontnames from the
given subresource name and class. That is, load the "*VT100.<i>name</i>.font", resource
as "*VT100.font" etc. If no name is given, the original set of fontnames
is restored. </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Unlike <b>set-vt-font()</b>, this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts,
since those are not based on resource values. It does affect the fonts loosely
organized under the ``Default'' menu entry: <b>font</b>, <b>boldFont</b>, <b>wideFont</b> and <b>wideBoldFont</b>.

<dl>

<dt><b>maximize()</b> </dt>
<dd>Resizes the window to fill the screen. </dd>

<dt><b>meta-sends-escape()</b> </dt>
<dd>This
action toggles the state of the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource. </dd>

<dt><b>popup-menu(<i>menuname</i>)</b>
</dt>
<dd>This action displays the specified popup menu. Valid names (case is significant)
include:  <i>mainMenu</i>, <i>vtMenu</i>, <i>fontMenu</i>, and <i>tekMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>print()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action prints
the window and is also invoked by the <i>print</i> entry in <i>mainMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>print-redir()</b>
</dt>
<dd>This action toggles the <b>printerControlMode</b> between 0 and 2. The corresponding
popup menu entry is useful for switching the printer off if you happen
to change your mind after deciding to print random binary files on the
terminal. </dd>

<dt><b>quit()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.
It is also invoked by the <b>quit</b> entry in <i>mainMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>redraw()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action redraws
the window and is also invoked by the <i>redraw</i> entry in <i>mainMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>restore()</b>
</dt>
<dd>Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized. </dd>

<dt><b>scroll-back(<i>count</i>
[,<i>units</i> [,<i>mouse</i>] ])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action scrolls the text window backward so that
text that had previously scrolled off the top of the screen is now visible.
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The <i>count</i> argument indicates the number of <i>units</i> (which may be <i>page</i>, <i>halfpage</i>,
<i>pixel</i>, or <i>line</i>) by which to scroll. </dl>
<p>
An adjustment can be specified for these
values by appending a "+" or "-" sign followed by a number, e.g., <i>page-2</i> to
specify 2 lines less than a page. </dl>
<p>
If the third parameter <i>mouse</i> is given,
the action is ignored when mouse reporting is enabled. 
<dl>

<dt><b>scroll-forw(<i>count</i>
[,<i>units</i> [,<i>mouse</i>] ])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action is similar to <b>scroll-back</b> except that it
scrolls in the other direction. </dd>

<dt><b>secure()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action toggles the <i>Secure
Keyboard</i> mode described in the section named <b>SECURITY</b>, and is invoked from
the <b>securekbd</b> entry in <i>mainMenu</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>select-cursor-end(<i>destname</i> [, ...])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action
is similar to <b>select-end</b> except that it should be used with <b>select-cursor-start</b>.
</dd>

<dt><b>select-cursor-start()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action is similar to <b>select-start</b> except that it
begins the selection at the current text cursor position. </dd>

<dt><b>select-end(<i>destname</i>
[, ...])</b> </dt>
<dd>This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections
or cutbuffers specified by <i>destname</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>select-extend()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action tracks the
pointer and extends the selection. It should only be bound to Motion events.
</dd>

<dt><b>select-set()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action stores text that corresponds to the current selection,
without affecting the selection mode. </dd>

<dt><b>select-start()</b> </dt>
<dd>This action begins text
selection at the current pointer location. See the section on <b>POINTER USAGE</b>
for information on making selections. </dd>

<dt><b>send-signal(<i>signame</i>)</b> </dt>
<dd>This action sends
the signal named by <i>signame</i> to the <i>xterm</i> subprocess (the shell or program
specified with the <i>-e</i> command line option) and is also invoked by the <b>suspend</b>,
<b>continue</b>, <b>interrupt</b>, <b>hangup</b>, <b>terminate</b>, and <b>kill</b> entries in <i>mainMenu</i>. Allowable
signal names are (case is not significant): <i>tstp</i> (if supported by the operating
system), <i>suspend</i> (same as <i>tstp</i>), <i>cont</i> (if supported by the operating system),
<i>int</i>, <i>hup</i>, <i>term</i>, <i>quit</i>, <i>alrm</i>, <i>alarm</i> (same as <i>alrm</i>) and <i>kill</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>set-allow132(<i>on/off/toggle</i>)</b>

Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard,
and unshifted select/paste for the primary selection. In each case, a (different)
cut buffer is also a target or source of the select/paste operation. It
is important to remember however, that cut buffers store data in ISO-8859-1
encoding, while selections can store data in a variety of formats and encodings.
While <i>xterm</i> owns the selection, it highlights it. When it loses the selection,
it removes the corresponding highlight. But you can still paste from the
corresponding cut buffer. <p>

<h2><a name='sect19' href='#toc19'>Control Sequences and Keyboard</a></h2>
The <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> document lists
the control sequences which an application can send <i>xterm</i> to make it perform
various operations. Most of these operations are standardized, from either
the DEC or Tektronix terminals, or from more widely used standards such
as ISO 6429. 
<h2><a name='sect20' href='#toc20'>Environment</a></h2>
<i>Xterm</i> sets several environment variables: 
<dl>

<dt>DISPLAY
</dt>
<dd>is the display name, pointing to the X server (see <b>DISPLAY NAMES</b> in <a href='X.7.html'>X(7)</a>
).
</dd>

<dt>TERM </dt>
<dd>is set according to the termcap (or terminfo) entry which it is using
as a reference. </dd>

<dt>WINDOWID </dt>
<dd>is set to the X window id number of the <i>xterm</i> window.
</dd>

<dt>XTERM_SHELL </dt>
<dd>is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked. Usually
that is a shell program, e.g., <b>/bin/sh</b>. Since it is not necessarily a shell
program however, it is distinct from ``SHELL''. </dd>

<dt>XTERM_VERSION </dt>
<dd>is set to the
string displayed by the <b>-version</b> option. That is normally an identifier for
the X Window libraries used to build <i>xterm</i>, followed by <i>xterm</i>'s patch number
in parenthesis. The patch number is also part of the response to a Secondary
Device Attributes (DA) control sequence (see <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>). </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Depending
on your system configuration, <i>xterm</i> may also set the following: 
<dl>

<dt>COLUMNS
</dt>
<dd>the width of the <i>xterm</i> in characters (cf: "stty columns"). </dd>

<dt>HOME </dt>
<dd>when <i>xterm</i>
is configured to update utmp. </dd>

<dt>LINES </dt>
<dd>the height of the <i>xterm</i> in characters
(cf: "stty rows"). </dd>

<dt>LOGNAME </dt>
<dd>when <i>xterm</i> is configured to update utmp. </dd>

<dt>SHELL
</dt>
<dd>when <i>xterm</i> is configured to update utmp. It is also set if you provide the
shell name as the optional parameter. </dd>

<dt>TERMCAP </dt>
<dd>the contents of the termcap
entry corresponding to $TERM, with lines and columns values substituted
for the actual size window you have created. </dd>

<dt>TERMINFO </dt>
<dd>may be defined to
a nonstandard location in the configure script. 
<!--
  
 
-->
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect21' href='#toc21'>Files</a></h2>
The actual pathnames
given may differ on your system. 
<dl>

<dt><i>/etc/utmp</i> </dt>
<dd>the system logfile, which records
user logins. </dd>

<dt><i>/etc/wtmp</i> </dt>
<dd>the system logfile, which records user logins and
logouts. </dd>

<dt><i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</i> </dt>
<dd>the <i>xterm</i> default application
resources. </dd>

<dt><i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color</i> </dt>
<dd>the <i>xterm</i> color application
resources. If your display supports color, use this  *customization: -color
 in your .Xdefaults file to automatically use this resource file rather
than <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</i>. If you do not do this, <i>xterm</i>
uses its compiled-in default resource settings for colors. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect22' href='#toc22'>Error Messages</a></h2>
Most
of the fatal error messages from <i>xterm</i> use the following format: <dl>xterm:

The <i>XXX</i> codes (which are used by <i>xterm</i> as its

<h2><a name='sect23' href='#toc23'>Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
Large pastes do not work on some
systems. This is not a bug in <i>xterm</i>; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal
driver of those systems. <i>xterm</i> feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast
as the pty will accept data, but some pty drivers do not return enough
information to know if the write has succeeded. <p>
Many of the options are
not resettable after <i>xterm</i> starts. <p>
This program still needs to be rewritten.
It should be split into very modular sections, with the various emulators
being completely separate widgets that do not know about each other. Ideally,
you'd like to be able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them
