<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The X firewall proxy (xfwp) is an application layer gateway
proxy that may be run on a network firewall host to forward X traffic across
the firewall.  Used in conjunction with the X server Security  extension
and authorization checking, xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, and reliable
mechanism both to hide the addresses of X servers located on the Intranet
and to enforce a server connection policy.  Xfwp cannot protect against
mischief originating on the Intranet; however, when  properly configured
it can guarantee that only trusted clients originating on authorized external
Internet hosts will be allowed inbound access to  local X servers.  
<p> To
use xfwp there must be an X proxy manager running in the local environment
which has been configured at start-up to know the location of the xfwp. 
[NOTE:  There may be more than one xfwp running in a local environment;
 see notes below on load balancing for further discussion.]  Using the 
xfindproxy utility (which relays its requests through the proxy manager)
 a user asks xfwp to allocate a client listen port for a particular X server,
 which is internally associated with all future connection requests for
that  server.  This client listen port address is returned by the proxy
manager through xfindproxy.  The xfwp hostname and port number is then passed
 out-of-band (i.e., via a Web browser) to some remote X client, which will
 subsequently connect to xfwp instead of to the target X server.  <br>
 When an X client connection request appears on one of xfwp's listen ports,
xfwp connects to the X server associated with this listen port and performs
 authorization checks against the server as well as against its own configurable
access control list for requesting clients.  If these checks fail, or if
the requested server does not support the X Security Extension, the client
 connection is refused.  Otherwise, the connection is accepted and all ensuing
 data between client and server is relayed by xfwp until the client terminates
 the connection or, in the case of an inactive client, until a configured
 timeout period is exceeded.  Xfwp is designed to block while waiting for
activity on its connections, thereby minimizing demand for system cycles.

<p> 
<p> If xfwp is run without a configuration file and thus no sitepolicy is
defined, if xfwp is using an X server where xhost + has been run to turn
 off host-based authorization checks, when a client tries to connect to
 this X server via xfwp, the X server will deny the connection.  If xfwp
 does not define a sitepolicy, host-based authorization must be turned on
 for clients to connect to an X server via the xfwp. <p>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Interoperation with
Ip Packet-filtering Routers</a></h2>
The whole purpose of the xfwp is to provide reliable
control over access to Intranet X servers by clients originating outside
the firewall.  At the present time, such access control is typically achieved
by firewall  configurations incorporating IP packet-filtering routers.  Frequently,
the rules for such filters deny access to X server ports (range 6000 - 6xxx)
for all Intranet host machines. 
<p> In order for xfwp to do its job, restrictions
on access for ports 6001 - 6xxx must be removed from the rule-base of the
IP packet-filtering router.  [NOTE: xfwp only assigns ports in the range
beginning with 6001; access to port 6000 on all Intranet hosts may continue
to be denied.]  This does not  mean the Intranet firewall will be opened
for indiscriminate entry by X clients.  Instead, xfwp supports a fully configurable
rule-based access control system, similar to that of the IP packet-filter
router itself.  Xfwp in effect adds another level of packet-filtering control
which is fully configurable and applies specifically to X traffic.  See
section entitled CONFIGURATION FILE, below, for further details.  <p>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Installation,
Setup and Troubleshooting</a></h2>
Xfwp is typically run as a background process
on the Intranet firewall host. It can be launched using any of the command-line
options described above. As noted above, xfwp works only in conjunction
with proxy manager and the  xfindproxy utility.  It can also be configured
to support a user-defined X server site security policy, in which the X
server is required to indicate to xfwp whether or not it supports the particular
policy.  Consult the  X server man pages for further information on these
components.  Xfwp  diagnostics can be turned on by compiling with the -DDEBUG
switch.   Connection status can be recorded by using the -logfile and -loglevel
command line options. <p>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Performance, Load Balancing and Resource Management</a></h2>
Xfwp
manages four different kinds of connections:  proxy manager (PM) data,
 X client listen, X client data, and X server.  The sysadmin employing xfwp
 must understand how the resources for each of these connection types are
 allocated and reclaimed by xfwp in order to optimize the availability
of  xfwp service. 
<p> Each connection-type has a default number of allocation
slots and  a default timeout.  The number of allocation slots for PM connections
and X server connections is configurable via command line options. Connection
timeouts are also configurable via command line options. Each connection
timeout represents the period the connection  will be allowed to remain
open in the absence of any activity on that  connection.  Whenever there
is activity on a connection, the time-to-close  is automatically reset.  The
default distribution of total process connection  slots across the four
connection types, as well as the choice of default timeouts for the connection
types, is governed by a number of assumptions embedded in the xfwp use
model.  
<p> 
<p> The default number of PM connections is 10 and the default duration
for PM connections is 3,600 seconds (1 hour) for each connection after
time of last activity.   At start-up, xfwp listens for PM connection requests
on any non-reserved  port (default of 4444 if not specified on the xfwp
command-line).  The PM  normally connects to xfwp only when a call is made
to the PM with xfindproxy.   Thereafter, the PM remains connected to xfwp,
even after the messaging between  them has been completed, for the default
connection duration period.  In some  cases this may result in depletion
of available PM connection slots. If the sysadmin expects connections to
a single xfwp from many PM's, xfwp should be started using the -pdt command
line option, with a timeout  value reflecting the desired duration that
inactive connections will be  permitted to remain open.  
<p> Xfwp client listeners
are set up by a call to xfindproxy and continue to  listen for X client
connection requests for a default duration of 86,400  seconds (24 hours)
from the point of last activity.  After this time they are automatically
closed and their fd's recovered for future allocation. In addressing the
question of how to choose some alternative timeout value which will guarantee
the availability of client listen ports, sysadmins should take into consideration
the expected delay between the time when the listener was allocated (using
xfindproxy) and the time  when a client actually attempts to connect to
xfwp, as well the likelihood that client listeners will be re-used after
the initial client data  connection is closed.  
<p> Each client connection
is allocated a default lifetime of 604,800  seconds (7 * 24 hours)  from
the point when it last saw activity.  After this time it is  automatically
closed and its fd's recovered for future allocation. Because server connections
are not actually established until a connection  request from a remote
X client arrives at one of the xfwp's client listen  ports, the client data
timeout applies both to client-xfwp connections as well as to xfwp-server
connections.  If the system administrator expects many client data connections
through xfwp, an overriding of the default timeout should be considered.
 <p>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Configuration File</a></h2>
The xfwp configuration file resides on the xfwp host
machine and is used to determine whether X client data connection requests
will be permitted or denied.  The path to the file is specified at start-up
time.  If no configuration file is specified, all X client data  connection
requests routed through xfwp will be by default permitted, assuming that
other X server authorization checks are successful.  If a configuration
file is supplied but none of its entries matches the  connection request
then the connection is by default denied. 
<p> If a line in the configuration
file begins with the '#' character or a new-line character, the line is ignored
and the evaluator will  skip the line. 
<p> The configuration file supports
two entirely independent authorization checks:  one which is performed
by xfwp itself, and a second which is the  result of xfwp's querying the
target X server.  For the first of these, the configuration file employs
a syntax and semantic similar to that of IP  packet-filtering routers.  It
contains zero or more source-destination rules of the following form: <p>
{permit
| deny} &lt;src&gt; &lt;src mask&gt; [&lt;dest&gt; &lt;dest mask&gt; [&lt;operator&gt; &lt;service&gt;]] <p>
</dl>
<p>
the keywords ``permit''
or ``deny'' indicate whether the  rule will enable or disable access, respectively
</dl>
<p>
the IP address against the host who originated the  connection request
will be matched, expressed in IP  format (x.x.x.x) </dl>
<p>
a subnet mask, also in
IP format, for further qualifying the source mask.  Bits set in the mask
indicate bits of the incoming address to be <i>ignored</i> when comparing to the
specified src </dl>
<p>
the IP address against which the destination of the  incoming
connection request (i.e. the host IP of the  X server to which the incoming
client is attempting to connect) will be matched </dl>
<p>
a subnet mask, also in
IP format, for further qualifying the destination mask.  Bits set in the
mask indicate bits of the destination address to be <i>ignored</i> when comparing
to the specified dest </dl>
<p>
always ``eq'' (if the service field is not NULL) </dl>
<p>
one
of the following three strings:  ``pm'', ``fp'', or ``cd'', corresponding to proxy
manager, xfindproxy, or client data, respectively  <p>
For the second type
of authorization check, the configuration file contains  zero or more site
policy rules of the following form: <p>
{require | disallow} sitepolicy &lt;site_policy&gt;
 <p>
</dl>
<p>
specifies that the X server <i>must</i> be configured with <i>at least one</i> of the
corresponding site policies, else it must refuse the connection. </dl>
<p>
specifies
that the X server <i>must not</i> be configured with <i>any</i> of the corresponding
site policies, else it must refuse the connection. </dl>
<p>
a required keyword </dl>
<p>
specifies
the policy string.  The string may contain any combination of alphanumeric
characters subject  only to interpretation by the target X server <p>

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Rules
for Evaluating the Xfwp Configuration File Entries</a></h2>
For the first type of
configurable authorization checking, access can be permitted or denied
for each connection type based upon source and, optionally, destination
and service.  Each file entry must at a minimum specify the keyword ``permit''
or ``deny'' and the two source fields.  The destination and service fields can
be used to provide finer-grained  access control if desired. <p>
The algorithm
for rule-matching is as follows:   <p>
<dl>  while (more entries to check)<br>
   {<br>
     if ((&lt;originator IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;src mask&gt;)) == src)<br>
       [if ((&lt;dest X server IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;dest mask&gt;)) == dest)] <br>
         [if (service fields present and matching)]<br>
           do either permit or deny connection depending on keyword<br>
     else<br>
       continue <br>
   }<br>
   if (no rule matches) <br>
     deny connection<br>
 </dl>
<p>
If a permit or deny rule does not specify a service and operation, then
the rule applies to all services.  If a configuration file is specified
 and it contains at least one valid deny or permit rule, then a host  that
is not explicitly permitted will be denied a connection. <p>
Site policy configuration
checking constitutes a separate (and X server only) authorization check
on incoming connection requests.  Any number of require or disallow rules
may be specified, but all rules must be of the same type; that is, a single
rule file cannot have both ``require'' and ``disallow'' keywords.  The algorithm
for this check is as follows: <p>
<dl>  if (X server recognizes any of the site
policy strings)<br>
     if (keyword == require)<br>
       permit connection<br>
     else<br>
       deny connection<br>
   else <br>
     if (keyword == require)<br>
       deny connection<br>
     else<br>
       permit connection <br>
 </dl>
<p>
The site policy check is performed by xfwp only if the source-destination
rules permit the connection. <p>
EXAMPLES <p>
<p>
 <br>
<pre># if and only if server supports one of these policies then authorize 
# connections, but still subject to applicable rule matches
#
require sitepolicy policy1
require sitepolicy policy2
#
# deny pm connections originating on 8.7.6.5 [NOTE:  If pm service
# is explicitly qualified, line must include destination fields as
# shown.]
#
deny  8.7.6.5  0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255  eq  pm
#
# permit xfindproxy X server connects to anywhere [NOTE:  If
# fp service is explicitly qualified, line must include source fields
# as shown.]
#
permit  0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255   0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255  eq  fp 
#
# permit all connection types originating from the 192.0.0.0 
# IP domain only 
#
permit  192.0.0.0   0.255.255.255 
</pre> <p>
Care should be taken that source-destination rules are written in the correct
order, as the first matching rule will be applied.  In addition to parser
syntax checking, a special command-line switch (-verify) has been provided
to assist the sysadmin in determining which rule was actually matched.
