<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>Xdm</i> manages a collection
of X displays, which may be on the local host or remote servers.  The design
of <i>xdm</i> was guided by the needs of X terminals as well as The Open Group
standard XDMCP, the <i>X Display Manager Control Protocol</i>. <i>Xdm</i> provides services
similar to those provided by <i>init</i>, <i>getty</i> and <i>login</i> on character terminals:
prompting for login name and password, authenticating the user, and running
a ``session.'' <p>
A ``session'' is defined by the lifetime of a particular process;
in the traditional character-based terminal world, it is the user's login
shell. In the <i>xdm</i> context, it is an arbitrary session manager.  This is because
in a windowing environment, a user's login shell process does not necessarily
have any terminal-like interface with which to connect. When a real session
manager is not available, a window manager or terminal emulator is typically
used as the ``session manager,'' meaning that termination of this process terminates
the user's session. <p>
When the session is terminated, <i>xdm</i> resets the X server
and (optionally) restarts the whole process. <p>
When <i>xdm</i> receives an Indirect
query via XDMCP, it can run a <i>chooser</i> process to perform an XDMCP BroadcastQuery
(or an XDMCP Query to specified hosts) on behalf of the display and offer
a menu of possible hosts that offer XDMCP display management. This feature
is useful with X terminals that do not offer a host menu themselves. <p>
<i>Xdm</i>
can be configured to ignore BroadcastQuery messages from selected hosts.
This is useful when you don't want the host to appear in menus produced
by <i>chooser</i> or X terminals themselves. <p>
Because <i>xdm</i> provides the first interface
that users will see, it is designed to be simple to use and easy to customize
to the needs of a particular site. <i>Xdm</i> has many options, most of which have
reasonable defaults.  Browse through the various sections of this manual,
picking and choosing the things you want to change. Pay particular attention
to the <b>Session Program</b> section, which will describe how to set up the style
of session desired. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Overview</a></h2>
<i>xdm</i> is highly configurable, and most of its
behavior can be controlled by resource files and shell scripts.  The names
of these files themselves are resources read from the file <i>xdm-config</i> or
the file named by the <b>-config</b> option. <p>
<i>xdm</i> offers display management two different
ways.  It can manage X servers running on the local machine and specified
in <i>Xservers</i>, and it can manage remote X servers (typically X terminals)
using XDMCP (the XDM Control Protocol) as specified in the <i>Xaccess</i> file.
<p>
The resources of the X clients run by <i>xdm</i> outside the user's session, including
<i>xdm</i>'s own login window, can be affected by setting resources in the <i>Xresources</i>
file. <p>
For X terminals that do not offer a menu of hosts to get display management
from, <i>xdm</i> can collect willing hosts and run the <i>chooser</i> program to offer
the user a menu. For X displays attached to a host, this step is typically
not used, as the local host does the display management. <p>
After resetting
the X server, <i>xdm</i> runs the <i>Xsetup</i> script to assist in setting up the screen
the user sees along with the <i>xlogin</i> widget. <p>
The <i>xlogin</i> widget, which <i>xdm</i>
presents, offers the familiar login and password prompts. <p>
After the user
logs in, <i>xdm</i> runs the <i>Xstartup</i> script as root. <p>
Then <i>xdm</i> runs the <i>Xsession</i>
script as the user.  This system session file may do some additional startup
and typically runs the <i>.xsession</i> script in the user's home directory. When
the <i>Xsession</i> script exits, the session is over. <p>
At the end of the session,
the <i>Xreset</i> script is run to clean up, the X server is reset, and the cycle
starts over. <p>
The file <i> /var/log/xdm.log</i> will contain error messages from
<i>xdm</i> and anything output to stderr by <i>Xsetup, Xstartup, Xsession</i> or <i>Xreset</i>.
When you have trouble getting <i>xdm</i> working, check this file to see if <i>xdm</i>
has any clues to the trouble. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
All of these options, except <b>-config</b>
itself, specify values that can also be specified in the configuration
file as resources. <p>
Names the configuration file, which specifies resources
to control the behavior of <i>xdm.</i> <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config</i> is the
default. See the section <b>Configuration File</b>. <p>
Specifies ``false'' as the value
for the <b>DisplayManager.daemonMode</b> resource. This suppresses the normal daemon
behavior, which is for <i>xdm</i> to close all file descriptors, disassociate
itself from the controlling terminal, and put itself in the background
when it first starts up. <p>
Specifies the numeric value for the <b>DisplayManager.debugLevel</b>
resource.  A non-zero value causes <i>xdm</i> to print lots of debugging statements
to the terminal; it also disables the <b>DisplayManager.daemonMode</b> resource,
forcing <i>xdm</i> to run synchronously.  To interpret these debugging messages,
a copy of the source code for <i>xdm</i> is almost a necessity.  No attempt has
been made to rationalize or standardize the output. <p>
Specifies the value
for the <b>DisplayManager.errorLogFile</b> resource. This file contains errors from
<i>xdm</i> as well as anything written to stderr by the various scripts and programs
run during the progress of the session. <p>
Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager*resources</b>
resource.  This file is loaded using <i>xrdb</i> to specify configuration parameters
for the authentication widget. <p>
Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.servers</b>
resource. See the section <b>Local Server Specification</b> for a description of
this resource. <p>
Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.requestPort</b> resource.
 This sets the port-number which <i>xdm</i> will monitor for XDMCP requests.  As
XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177, this resource should
not be changed except for debugging. If set to 0 xdm will not listen for
XDMCP or Chooser requests. <p>
Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager*session</b>
resource.  This indicates the program to run as the session after the user
has logged in. <p>
Allows an arbitrary resource to be specified, as in most
X Toolkit applications. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Resources</a></h2>
At many stages the actions of <i>xdm</i> can be
controlled through the use of its configuration file, which is in the X
resource format. Some resources modify the behavior of <i>xdm</i> on all displays,
while others modify its behavior on a single display.  Where actions relate
to a specific display, the display name is inserted into the resource name
between ``DisplayManager'' and the final resource name segment. <p>
For local displays,
the resource name and class are as read from the <i>Xservers</i> file. <p>
For remote
displays, the resource name is what the network address of the display
resolves to.  See the <b>removeDomain</b> resource.  The name must match exactly;
<i>xdm</i> is not aware of all the network aliases that might reach a given display.
If the name resolve fails, the address is used.  The resource class is as
sent by the display in the XDMCP Manage request. <p>
Because the resource manager
uses colons to separate the name of the resource from its value and dots
to separate resource name parts, <i>xdm</i> substitutes underscores for both dots
and colons when generating the resource name. For example, <b>DisplayManager.expo_x_org_0.startup</b>
is the name of the resource which defines the startup shell file for the
``expo.x.org:0'' display. 
<!--
  
 
-->
<p>
This resource either specifies a file name full of
server entries, one per line (if the value starts with a slash), or a single
server entry. See the section <b>Local Server Specification</b> for the details.
<p>
This indicates the UDP port number which <i>xdm</i> uses to listen for incoming
XDMCP requests.  Unless you need to debug the system, leave this with its
default value of 177. <p>
Error output is normally directed at the system console.
 To redirect it, set this resource to a file name.  A method to send these
messages to <i>syslog</i> should be developed for systems which support it; however,
the wide variety of interfaces precludes any system-independent implementation.
 This file also contains any output directed to stderr by the <i>Xsetup, Xstartup,
Xsession</i> and <i>Xreset</i> files, so it will contain descriptions of problems
in those scripts as well. <p>
If the integer value of this resource is greater
than zero, reams of debugging information will be printed.  It also disables
daemon mode, which would redirect the information into the bit-bucket, and
allows non-root users to run <i>xdm,</i> which would normally not be useful. <p>
Normally,
<i>xdm</i> attempts to make itself into a daemon process unassociated with any
terminal. This is accomplished by forking and leaving the parent process
to exit, then closing file descriptors and releasing the controlling terminal.
 In some environments this is not desired (in particular, when debugging).
 Setting this resource to ``false'' will disable this feature. <p>
The filename
specified will be created to contain an ASCII representation of the process-id
of the main <i>xdm</i> process. <i>Xdm</i> also uses file locking on this file to attempt
to eliminate multiple daemons running on the same machine, which would
cause quite a bit of havoc. <p>
This is the resource which controls whether
<i>xdm</i> uses file locking to keep multiple display managers from running amok.
On System V, this uses the <i>lockf</i> library call, while on BSD it uses <i>flock.</i>
<p>
This names a directory under which <i>xdm</i> stores authorization files while
initializing the session.  The default value is <i> /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm</i>.
Can be overridden for specific displays by DisplayManager.<i>DISPLAY</i>.authFile.
<p>
This boolean controls whether <i>xdm</i> rescans the configuration, servers, access
control and authentication keys files after a session terminates and the
files have changed.  By default it is ``true.''  You can force <i>xdm</i> to reread
these files by sending a SIGHUP to the main process. <p>
When computing the
display name for XDMCP clients, the name resolver will typically create
a fully qualified host name for the terminal.  As this is sometimes confusing,
<i>xdm</i> will remove the domain name portion of the host name if it is the same
as the domain name of the local host when this variable is set.  By default
the value is ``true.'' <p>
XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1 style XDMCP authentication requires
that a private key be shared between <i>xdm</i> and the terminal.  This resource
specifies the file containing those values.  Each entry in the file consists
of a display name and the shared key.  By default, <i>xdm</i> does not include
support for XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1, as it requires DES which is not generally
distributable because of United States export restrictions. <p>
To prevent unauthorized
XDMCP service and to allow forwarding of XDMCP IndirectQuery requests,
this file contains a database of hostnames which are either allowed direct
access to this machine, or have a list of hosts to which queries should
be forwarded to.  The format of this file is described in the section <b>XDMCP
Access Control.</b> <p>
A list of additional environment variables, separated by
white space, to pass on to the <i>Xsetup</i>, <i>Xstartup</i>, <i>Xsession</i>, and <i>Xreset</i> programs.
<p>
A file to checksum to generate the seed of authorization keys. This should
be a file that changes frequently. The default is <i>/dev/mem</i>. 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> <p>
On systems
that support a dynamically-loadable greeter library, the name of the library.
 The default is <i> /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/libXdmGreet.so</i>. <p>
Number of seconds
to wait for display to respond after user has selected a host from the
chooser.  If the display sends an XDMCP IndirectQuery within this time,
the request is forwarded to the chosen host.  Otherwise, it is assumed to
be from a new session and the chooser is offered again. Default is 15. <p>
Use
the numeric IP address of the incoming connection on multihomed hosts instead
of the host name. This is to avoid trying to connect on the wrong interface
which might be down at this time. <p>
This specifies a program which is run
(as) root when an an XDMCP BroadcastQuery is received and this host is
configured to offer XDMCP display management. The output of this program
may be displayed on a chooser window.  If no program is specified, the string
<i>Willing to manage</i> is sent. <p>

<!--
  
 
-->
<p>
This resource specifies the name of the file
to be loaded by <i>xrdb</i> as the resource database onto the root window of screen
0 of the display. The <i>Xsetup</i> program, the Login widget, and <i>chooser</i> will
use the resources set in this file. This resource data base is loaded just
before the authentication procedure is started, so it can control the appearance
of the login window.  See the section <b>Authentication Widget,</b> which describes
the various resources that are appropriate to place in this file. There
is no default value for this resource, but <i> /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources</i>
is the conventional name. <p>
Specifies the program run to offer a host menu
for Indirect queries redirected to the special host name CHOOSER. <i> /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/chooser
</i> is the default. See the sections <b>XDMCP Access Control</b> and <b>Chooser</b>. <p>
Specifies
the program used to load the resources.  By default, <i>xdm</i> uses <i> /usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb</i>.
<p>
This specifies the name of the C preprocessor which is used by <i>xrdb</i>. <p>
This
specifies a program which is run (as root) before offering the Login window.
 This may be used to change the appearance of the screen around the Login
window or to put up other windows (e.g., you may want to run <i>xconsole</i> here).
By default, no program is run.  The conventional name for a file used here
is <i>Xsetup</i>. See the section <b>Setup Program.</b> <p>
This specifies a program which
is run (as root) after the authentication process succeeds.  By default,
no program is run.  The conventional name for a file used here is <i>Xstartup</i>.
See the section <b>Startup Program.</b> <p>
This specifies the session to be executed
(not running as root). By default, <i> /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm</i> is run.  The conventional
name is <i>Xsession</i>. See the section <b>Session Program.</b> <p>
This specifies a program
which is run (as root) after the session terminates. By default, no program
is run. The conventional name is <i>Xreset</i>. See the section <b>Reset Program.</b> <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
These
numeric resources control the behavior of <i>xdm</i> when attempting to open intransigent
servers.  <b>openDelay</b> is the length of the pause (in seconds) between successive
attempts, <b>openRepeat</b> is the number of attempts to make, <b>openTimeout</b> is
the amount of time to wait while actually attempting the open (i.e., the
maximum time spent in the <a href='connect.2.html'><i>connect</i>(2)</a>
 system call) and <b>startAttempts</b> is
the number of times this entire process is done before giving up on the
server.  After <b>openRepeat</b> attempts have been made, or if <b>openTimeout</b> seconds
elapse in any particular attempt, <i>xdm</i> terminates and restarts the server,
attempting to connect again. This process is repeated <b>startAttempts</b> times,
at which point the display is declared dead and disabled.  Although this
behavior may seem arbitrary, it has been empirically developed and works
quite well on most systems.  The default values are 5 for <b>openDelay</b>, 5 for
<b>openRepeat</b>, 30 for <b>openTimeout</b> and 4 for <b>startAttempts</b>. <p>
<p>
To discover when
remote displays disappear, <i>xdm</i> occasionally pings them, using an X connection
and <i>XSync</i> calls.  <b>pingInterval</b> specifies the time (in minutes) between each
ping attempt, <b>pingTimeout</b> specifies the maximum amount of time (in minutes)
to wait for the terminal to respond to the request.  If the terminal does
not respond, the session is declared dead and terminated.  By default, both
are set to 5 minutes.  If you frequently use X terminals which can become
isolated from the managing host, you may wish to increase this value.  The
only worry is that sessions will continue to exist after the terminal has
been accidentally disabled. <i>xdm</i> will not ping local displays.  Although it
would seem harmless, it is unpleasant when the workstation session is terminated
as a result of the server hanging for NFS service and not responding to
the ping. <p>
This boolean resource specifies whether the X server should be
terminated when a session terminates (instead of resetting it).  This option
can be used when the server tends to grow without bound over time, in order
to limit the amount of time the server is run.  The default value is ``false.''
<p>
<i>Xdm</i> sets the PATH environment variable for the session to this value.  It
should be a colon separated list of directories; see <a href='sh.1.html'><i>sh</i>(1)</a>
 for a full description.
``:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb'' is a common setting. The default
value can be specified at build time in the X system configuration file
with DefaultUserPath. <p>
<i>Xdm</i> sets the PATH environment variable for the startup
and reset scripts to the value of this resource.  The default for this resource
is specified at build time by the DefaultSystemPath entry in the system
configuration file; ``/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb'' is a common
choice. Note the absence of ``.'' from this entry.  This is a good practice to
follow for root; it avoids many common Trojan Horse system penetration
schemes. <p>
<i>Xdm</i> sets the SHELL environment variable for the startup and reset
scripts to the value of this resource.  It is <i>/bin/sh</i> by default. <p>
If the
default session fails to execute, <i>xdm</i> will fall back to this program.  This
program is executed with no arguments, but executes using the same environment
variables as the session would have had (see the section <b>Session Program</b>).
By default, <i> /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm</i> is used. <p>
<p>
To improve security, <i>xdm</i> grabs
the server and keyboard while reading the login name and password. The <b>grabServer</b>
resource specifies if the server should be held for the duration of the
name/password reading.  When ``false,'' the server is ungrabbed after the keyboard
grab succeeds, otherwise the server is grabbed until just before the session
begins.  The default is ``false.'' The <b>grabTimeout</b> resource specifies the maximum
time <i>xdm</i> will wait for the grab to succeed.  The grab may fail if some other
client has the server grabbed, or possibly if the network latencies are
very high.  This resource has a default value of 3 seconds; you should be
cautious when raising it, as a user can be spoofed by a look-alike window
on the display.  If the grab fails, <i>xdm</i> kills and restarts the server (if
possible) and the session. <p>
<p>
<b>authorize</b> is a boolean resource which controls
whether <i>xdm</i> generates and uses authorization for the local server connections.
 If authorization is used, <b>authName</b> is a list of authorization mechanisms
to use, separated by white space. XDMCP connections dynamically specify
which authorization mechanisms are supported, so <b>authName</b> is ignored in
this case.  When <b>authorize</b> is set for a display and authorization is not
available, the user is informed by having a different message displayed
in the login widget.  By default, <b>authorize</b> is ``true.''  <b>authName</b> is ``MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,''
or, if XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is available, ``XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.''
<p>
This file is used to communicate the authorization data from <i>xdm</i> to the
server, using the <b>-auth</b> server command line option. It should be kept in
a directory which is not world-writable as it could easily be removed, disabling
the authorization mechanism in the server. If not specified, a name is generated
from DisplayManager.authDir and the name of the display. <p>
If set to ``false,''
disables the use of the <b>unsecureGreeting</b> in the login window. See the section
<b>Authentication Widget.</b> The default is ``true.'' <p>
The number of the signal <i>xdm</i>
sends to reset the server. See the section <b>Controlling the Server.</b> The default
is 1 (SIGHUP). <p>
The number of the signal <i>xdm</i> sends to terminate the server.
See the section <b>Controlling the Server.</b> The default is 15 (SIGTERM). <p>
The
original implementation of authorization in the sample server reread the
authorization file at server reset time, instead of when checking the initial
connection.  As <i>xdm</i> generates the authorization information just before
connecting to the display, an old server would not get up-to-date authorization
information. This resource causes <i>xdm</i> to send SIGHUP to the server after
setting up the file, causing an additional server reset to occur, during
which time the new authorization information will be read. The default is
``false,'' which will work for all MIT servers. <p>
When <i>xdm</i> is unable to write
to the usual user authorization file ($HOME/.Xauthority), it creates a unique
file name in this directory and points the environment variable XAUTHORITY
at the created file.  It uses <i>/tmp</i> by default. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Configuration File</a></h2>
First, the
<i>xdm</i> configuration file should be set up. Make a directory (usually <i> /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm</i>)
to contain all of the relevant files. <p>
Here is a reasonable configuration
file, which could be named <i>xdm-config</i>: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager.servers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager.errorLogFile:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/var/log/xdm.log
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager*resources:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager*startup:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xstartup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager*session:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager.pidFile:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-pid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager._0.authorize:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayManager*authorize:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false
</pre><p>
Note that this file mostly contains references to other files.  Note also
that some of the resources are specified with ``*'' separating the components.
 These resources can be made unique for each different display, by replacing
the ``*'' with the display-name, but normally this is not very useful.  See the
<b>Resources</b> section for a complete discussion. 
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Xdmcp Access Control</a></h2>
<p>
The database
file specified by the <b>DisplayManager.accessFile</b> provides information which
<i>xdm</i> uses to control access from displays requesting XDMCP service.  This
file contains three types of entries:  entries which control the response
to Direct and Broadcast queries, entries which control the response to
Indirect queries, and macro definitions. <p>
The format of the Direct entries
is simple, either a host name or a pattern, which is distinguished from
a host name by the inclusion of one or more meta characters (`*' matches
any sequence of 0 or more characters, and `?' matches any single character)
which are compared against the host name of the display device. If the entry
is a host name, all comparisons are done using network addresses, so any
name which converts to the correct network address may be used. For patterns,
only canonical host names are used in the comparison, so ensure that you
do not attempt to match aliases. Preceding either a host name or a pattern
with a `!' character causes hosts which match that entry to be excluded. <p>
To
only respond to Direct queries for a host or pattern, it can be followed
by the optional ``NOBROADCAST'' keyword. This can be used to prevent an xdm
server from appearing on menus based on Broadcast queries. <p>
An Indirect entry
also contains a host name or pattern, but follows it with a list of host
names or macros to which indirect queries should be sent. <p>
A macro definition
contains a macro name and a list of host names and other macros that the
macro expands to.  To distinguish macros from hostnames, macro names start
with a `%' character.  Macros may be nested. <p>
Indirect entries may also specify
to have <i>xdm</i> run <i>chooser</i> to offer a menu of hosts to connect to.  See the
section <b>Chooser</b>. <p>
When checking access for a particular display host, each
entry is scanned in turn and the first matching entry determines the response.
 Direct and Broadcast entries are ignored when scanning for an Indirect
entry and vice-versa. <p>
Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment
delimiter causing the rest of that line to be ignored, and `\<i>newline</i>' causes
the newline to be ignored, allowing indirect host lists to span multiple
lines. <p>
Here is an example Xaccess file: <p>
<br>
<pre>#
# Xaccess - XDMCP access control file
#
#
# Direct/Broadcast query entries
#
!xtra.lcs.mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
bambi.ogi.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# allow access from this particular display
*.lcs.mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# allow access from any display in LCS
*.deshaw.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOBROADCAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# allow only direct access
*.gw.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# allow direct and broadcast
#
# Indirect query entries

*.lcs.mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%HOSTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#all others get to choose
</pre><p>
If compiled with IPv6 support, multicast address groups may also be included
in the list of addresses indirect queries are set to.  Multicast addresses
may be followed by an optional / character and hop count. If no hop count
is specified, the multicast hop count defaults to 1, keeping the packet
on the local network. For IPv4 multicasting, the hop count is used as the
TTL. <p>
Examples: <p>

<pre>rincewind.sample.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ff02::1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#IPv6 Multicast to ff02::1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#with a hop count of 1
ponder.sample.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHOOSER 239.192.1.1/16  #Offer a menu of hosts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#who respond to IPv4 Multicast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# to 239.192.1.1 with a TTL of 16
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Chooser</a></h2>
<p>
For X terminals that do not offer a host menu for use with Broadcast
or Indirect queries, the <i>chooser</i> program can do this for them. In the <i>Xaccess</i>
file, specify ``CHOOSER'' as the first entry in the Indirect host list.  <i>Chooser</i>
will send a Query request to each of the remaining host names in the list
and offer a menu of all the hosts that respond. <p>
The list may consist of
the word ``BROADCAST,'' in which case <i>chooser</i> will send a Broadcast instead,
again offering a menu of all hosts that respond.  Note that on some operating
systems, UDP packets cannot be broadcast, so this feature will not work.
<p>
Example <i>Xaccess</i> file using <i>chooser</i>: 
<p> <br>
<pre>extract.lcs.mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHOOSER %HOSTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#offer a menu of these hosts
xtra.lcs.mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHOOSER BROADCAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#offer a menu of all hosts
</pre><p>
The program to use for <i>chooser</i> is specified by the <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.chooser</b>
resource.  For more flexibility at this step, the chooser could be a shell
script. <i>Chooser</i> is the session manager here; it is run instead of a child
<i>xdm</i> to manage the display. <p>
Resources for this program can be put into the
file named by <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.resources</b>. <p>
When the user selects a host,
<i>chooser</i> prints the host chosen, which is read by the parent <i>xdm</i>, and exits.
<i>xdm</i> closes its connection to the X server, and the server resets and sends
another <b>Indirect</b> XDMCP request. <i>xdm</i> remembers the user's choice (for <b>DisplayManager.choiceTimeout</b>
seconds) and forwards the request to the chosen host, which starts a session
on that display. 
<!--

<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Listen</a></h2>
The following configuration directive is also defined
for the Xaccess configuration file: <p>
<i>interface</i> may be a hostname or IP addresss
representing a network interface on this machine, or the wildcard * to
represent all available network interfaces. <p>
If one or more LISTEN lines
are specified, xdm only listens for XDMCP connections on the specified
interfaces. If multicast group addresses are listed on a listen line, xdm
joins the multicast groups on the given interface. <p>
If no LISTEN lines are
given, the original behavior of listening on all interfaces is preserved
for backwards compatibility. Additionally, if no LISTEN is specified, xdm
joins the default XDMCP IPv6 multicast group, when compiled with IPv6 support.
<p>
To disable listening for XDMCP connections altogther, a line of LISTEN
with no addresses may be specified, or the previously supported method
of setting DisplayManager.requestPort to 0 may be used. <p>
Examples: <br>
<pre>LISTEN * ff02::1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Listen on all interfaces and to the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# ff02::1 IPv6 multicast group.
LISTEN 10.11.12.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Listen only on this interface, as long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# as no other listen directives appear in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# file.
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>IPv6 MULTICAST ADDRESS SPECIFICATION</a></h2>
<p>
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
has has assigned  ff0<i>X</i>:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b as the permanently assigned range
of  multicast addresses for XDMCP. The <i>X</i> in the prefix may be replaced by
any valid scope identifier, such as 1 for Node-Local, 2 for Link-Local, 5
for Site-Local, and so on.  (See IETF RFC 2373 or its replacement for  further
details and scope definitions.)  xdm defaults to listening on the Link-Local
scope address ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b to most closely match the  old IPv4
subnet broadcast behavior. 
<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Local Server Specification</a></h2>
<p>
The resource <b>DisplayManager.servers</b>
gives a server specification or, if the values starts with a slash (/),
the name of a file containing server specifications, one per line. <p>
Each
specification indicates a display which should constantly be managed and
which is not using XDMCP. This method is used typically for local servers
only.  If the resource or the file named by the resource is empty, <i>xdm</i> will
offer XDMCP service only. <p>
Each specification consists of at least three
parts:  a display name, a display class, a display type, and (for local
servers) a command line to start the server.  A typical entry for local
display number 0 would be: <br>
<pre>  :0 Digital-QV local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0
</pre>The display types are: <br>
<pre>local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local display: <i>xdm</i> must run the server
foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remote display: <i>xdm</i> opens an X connection to a running server
</pre><p>
The display name must be something that can be passed in the <b>-display</b> option
to an X program.  This string is used to generate the display-specific resource
names, so be careful to match the names (e.g., use ``:0 Sun-CG3 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X
:0'' instead of ``localhost:0 Sun-CG3 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0'' if your other
resources are specified as ``DisplayManager._0.session'').  The display class
portion is also used in the display-specific resources, as the class of
the resource.  This is useful if you have a large collection of similar
displays (such as a corral of X terminals) and would like to set resources
for groups of them.  When using XDMCP, the display is required to specify
the display class, so the manual for your particular X terminal should
document the display class string for your device.  If it doesn't, you can
run <i>xdm</i> in debug mode and look at the resource strings which it generates
for that device, which will include the class string. <p>
When <i>xdm</i> starts a
session, it sets up authorization data for the server.  For local servers,
<i>xdm</i> passes ``<b>-auth</b> <i>filename</i>'' on the server's command line to point it at its
authorization data. For XDMCP servers, <i>xdm</i> passes the authorization data
to the server via the <b>Accept</b> XDMCP request. 
<h2><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>Resources File</a></h2>
The <i>Xresources</i>
file is loaded onto the display as a resource database using <i>xrdb.</i> As the
authentication widget reads this database before starting up, it usually
contains parameters for that widget: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xlogin*login.translations: #override\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;R: abort-display()\n\/&amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Key&gt;F1: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Key&gt;Return: set-session-argument() finish-field()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xlogin*borderWidth: 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#ifdef COLOR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xlogin*greetColor: CadetBlue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xlogin*failColor: red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#endif
</pre><p>
Please note the translations entry; it specifies a few new translations
for the widget which allow users to escape from the default session (and
avoid troubles that may occur in it).  Note that if #override is not specified,
the default translations are removed and replaced by the new value, not
a very useful result as some of the default translations are quite useful
(such as ``&lt;Key&gt;: insert-char ()'' which responds to normal typing). <p>
This file
may also contain resources for the setup program and <i>chooser</i>. 
<h2><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>Setup Program</a></h2>
The
<i>Xsetup</i> file is run after the server is reset, but before the Login window
is offered. The file is typically a shell script. It is run as root, so should
be careful about security. This is the place to change the root background
or bring up other windows that should appear on the screen along with the
Login widget. <p>
In addition to any specified by <b>DisplayManager.exportList</b>,
the following environment variables are passed: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISPLAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the associated display name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.systemPath</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHELL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.systemShell</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XAUTHORITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be set to an authority file
</pre><p>
Note that since <i>xdm</i> grabs the keyboard, any other windows will not be able
to receive keyboard input.  They will be able to interact with the mouse,
however; beware of potential security holes here. If <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.grabServer</b>
is set, <i>Xsetup</i> will not be able to connect to the display at all. Resources
for this program can be put into the file named by <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.resources</b>.
<p>
Here is a sample <i>Xsetup</i> script: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/sh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Xsetup_0 - setup script for one workstation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xcmsdb &lt; /usr/X11R6/lib/monitors/alex.0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xconsole -geometry 480x130-0-0 -notify -verbose -exitOnFail &amp;
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect14' href='#toc14'>Authentication Widget</a></h2>
The authentication widget reads a name/password pair
from the keyboard.  Nearly every imaginable parameter can be controlled
with a resource.  Resources for this widget should be put into the file
named by <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.resources</b>.  All of these have reasonable default
values, so it is not necessary to specify any of them. <p>
The geometry of the
Login widget is normally computed automatically.  If you wish to position
it elsewhere, specify each of these resources. <p>
The color used to display
the typed-in user name. <p>
The font used to display the typed-in user name. <p>
A
string which identifies this window. The default is ``X Window System.'' <p>
When
X authorization is requested in the configuration file for this display
and none is in use, this greeting replaces the standard greeting.  The default
is ``This is an unsecure session'' <p>
The font used to display the greeting. <p>
The
color used to display the greeting. <p>
The string displayed to prompt for a
user name. <i>Xrdb</i> strips trailing white space from resource values, so to
add spaces at the end of the prompt (usually a nice thing), add spaces
escaped with backslashes.  The default is ``Login:  '' <p>
The string displayed
to prompt for a password. The default is ``Password:  '' <p>
The font used to display
both prompts. <p>
The color used to display both prompts. <p>
A message which is
displayed when the authentication fails. The default is ``Login incorrect''
<p>
The font used to display the failure message. <p>
The color used to display
the failure message. <p>
The number of seconds that the failure message is displayed.
The default is 30. <p>
If set to ``false'', don't allow root (and any other user
with uid = 0) to log in directly. The default is ``true''. <p>
If set to ``true'', allow
an otherwise failing password match to succeed if the account does not
require a password at all. The default is ``false'', so only users that have
passwords assigned can log in. <p>
This specifies the translations used for
the login widget.  Refer to the X Toolkit documentation for a complete discussion
on translations.  The default translation table is: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete-previous-character() \n\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;D:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete-character() \n\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Key&gt;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insert-char() \
</pre><p>
The actions which are supported by the widget are: <p>
Erases the character
before the cursor. <p>
Erases the character after the cursor. <p>
Moves the cursor
backward. <p>
Moves the cursor forward. <p>
(Apologies about the spelling error.)
Moves the cursor to the beginning of the editable text. <p>
Moves the cursor
to the end of the editable text. <p>
Erases all text after the cursor. <p>
Erases
the entire text. <p>
If the cursor is in the name field, proceeds to the password
field; if the cursor is in the password field, checks the current name/password
pair.  If the name/password pair is valid, <i>xdm</i> starts the session.  Otherwise
the failure message is displayed and the user is prompted again. <p>
Terminates
and restarts the server. <p>
Terminates the server, disabling it.  This action
is not accessible in the default configuration. There are various reasons
to stop <i>xdm</i> on a system console, such as when shutting the system down,
when using <i>xdmshell</i>, to start another type of server, or to generally access
the console. Sending <i>xdm</i> a SIGHUP will restart the display.  See the section
<b>Controlling XDM</b>. <p>
Resets the X server and starts a new session.  This can
be used when the resources have been changed and you want to test them
or when the screen has been overwritten with system messages. <p>
Inserts the
character typed. <p>
Specifies a single word argument which is passed to the
session at startup. See the section <b>Session Program</b>. <p>
Disables access control
in the server.  This can be used when the .Xauthority file cannot be created
by <i>xdm.</i> Be very careful using this; it might be better to disconnect the
machine from the network before doing this. <p>
On some systems (OpenBSD) the
user's shell must be listed in <i>/etc/shells</i> to allow login through xdm. The
normal password and account expiration dates are enforced too. 
<h2><a name='sect15' href='#toc15'>Startup Program</a></h2>
<p>
The
<i>Xstartup</i> program is run as root when the user logs in. It is typically a
shell script. Since it is run as root, <i>Xstartup</i> should be very careful about
security.  This is the place to put commands which add entries to <i>/etc/utmp</i>
(the <i>sessreg</i> program may be useful here), mount users' home directories
from file servers, or abort the session if logins are not allowed. <p>
In addition
to any specified by <b>DisplayManager.exportList</b>, the following environment
variables are passed: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISPLAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the associated display name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the initial working directory of the user
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOGNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.systemPath</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHELL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.systemShell</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XAUTHORITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be set to an authority file
</pre><p>
No arguments are passed to the script. <i>Xdm</i> waits until this script exits
before starting the user session.  If the exit value of this script is non-zero,
<i>xdm</i> discontinues the session and starts another authentication cycle. <p>
The
sample <i>Xstartup</i> file shown here prevents login while the file <i>/etc/nologin</i>
exists. Thus this is not a complete example, but simply a demonstration
of the available functionality. <p>
Here is a sample <i>Xstartup</i> script: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/sh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Xstartup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# This program is run as root after the user is verified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if [ -f /etc/nologin ]; then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmessage -file /etc/nologin -timeout 30 -center
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/GiveConsole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit 0
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect16' href='#toc16'>Session Program</a></h2>
<p>
The <i>Xsession</i> program is the command which is run as the
user's session. It is run with the permissions of the authorized user. <p>
In
addition to any specified by <b>DisplayManager.exportList</b>, the following environment
variables are passed: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISPLAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the associated display name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the initial working directory of the user
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOGNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.userPath</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHELL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user's default shell (from <i>getpwnam</i>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XAUTHORITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be set to a non-standard authority file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KRB5CCNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be set to a Kerberos credentials cache name
</pre><p>
At most installations, <i>Xsession</i> should look in $HOME for a file <i>.xsession,</i>
which contains commands that each user would like to use as a session. <i>Xsession</i>
should also implement a system default session if no user-specified session
exists. See the section <b>Typical Usage</b>. <p>
An argument may be passed to this
program from the authentication widget using the `set-session-argument' action.
 This can be used to select different styles of session.  One good use of
this feature is to allow the user to escape from the ordinary session when
it fails.  This allows users to repair their own <i>.xsession</i> if it fails, without
requiring administrative intervention. The example following demonstrates
this feature. <p>
This example recognizes the special ``failsafe'' mode, specified
in the translations in the <i>Xresources</i> file, to provide an escape from the
ordinary session.  It also requires that the .xsession file be executable
so we don't have to guess what shell it wants to use. <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/sh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Xsession

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
</pre><p>
The user's <i>.xsession</i> file might look something like this example.  Don't forget
that the file must have execute permission. <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/csh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# no -f in the previous line so .cshrc gets run to set $PATH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xterm -geometry -0+50 -ls
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect17' href='#toc17'>Reset Program</a></h2>
<p>
Symmetrical with <i>Xstartup</i>, the <i>Xreset</i> script is run after
the user session has terminated.  Run as root, it should contain commands
that undo the effects of commands in <i>Xstartup,</i> removing entries from <i>/etc/utmp</i>
or unmounting directories from file servers.  The environment variables
that were passed to <i>Xstartup</i> are also passed to <i>Xreset</i>. <p>
A sample <i>Xreset</i>
script: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/sh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Xreset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# This program is run as root after the session ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/TakeConsole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit 0
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect18' href='#toc18'>Controlling the Server</a></h2>
<i>Xdm</i> controls local servers using POSIX signals.  SIGHUP
is expected to reset the server, closing all client connections and performing
other cleanup duties.  SIGTERM is expected to terminate the server. If these
signals do not perform the expected actions, the resources <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.resetSignal</b>
and <b>DisplayManager.</b><i>DISPLAY</i><b>.termSignal</b> can specify alternate signals. <p>
To control
remote terminals not using XDMCP, <i>xdm</i> searches the window hierarchy on
the display and uses the protocol request KillClient in an attempt to clean
up the terminal for the next session.  This may not actually kill all of
the clients, as only those which have created windows will be noticed. 
XDMCP provides a more sure mechanism; when <i>xdm</i> closes its initial connection,
the session is over and the terminal is required to close all other connections.

<h2><a name='sect19' href='#toc19'>Controlling Xdm</a></h2>
<p>
<i>Xdm</i> responds to two signals: SIGHUP and SIGTERM.  When sent
a SIGHUP, <i>xdm</i> rereads the configuration file, the access control file,
and the servers file.  For the servers file, it notices if entries have
been added or removed.  If a new entry has been added, <i>xdm</i> starts a session
on the associated display.  Entries which have been removed are disabled
immediately, meaning that any session in progress will be terminated without
notice and no new session will be started. <p>
When sent a SIGTERM, <i>xdm</i> terminates
all sessions in progress and exits.  This can be used when shutting down
the system. <p>
<i>Xdm</i> attempts to mark its various sub-processes for <a href='ps.1.html'><i>ps</i>(1)</a>
 by editing
the command line argument list in place.  Because <i>xdm</i> can't allocate additional
space for this task, it is useful to start <i>xdm</i> with a reasonably long command
line (using the full path name should be enough). Each process which is
servicing a display is marked <b>-</b><i>display.</i> 
<h2><a name='sect20' href='#toc20'>Additional Local Displays</a></h2>
<p>
To add an
additional local display, add a line for it to the <i>Xservers</i> file. (See the
section <b>Local Server Specification</b>.) <p>
Examine the display-specific resources
in <i>xdm-config</i> (e.g., <b>DisplayManager._0.authorize</b>) and consider which of them
should be copied for the new display. The default <i>xdm-config</i> has all the
appropriate lines for displays <b>:0</b> and <b>:1</b>. 
<h2><a name='sect21' href='#toc21'>Other Possibilities</a></h2>
<p>
You can use
<i>xdm</i> to run a single session at a time, using the 4.3 <i>init</i> options or other
suitable daemon by specifying the server on the command line: <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xdm -server lq:0 SUN-3/60CG4 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0rq
</pre><p>
Or, you might have a file server and a collection of X terminals.  The configuration
for this is identical to the sample above, except the <i>Xservers</i> file would
look like <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extol:0 VISUAL-19 foreign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exalt:0 NCD-19 foreign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explode:0 NCR-TOWERVIEW3000 foreign
</pre><p>
This directs <i>xdm</i> to manage sessions on all three of these terminals.  See
the section <b>Controlling Xdm</b> for a description of using signals to enable
and disable these terminals in a manner reminiscent of <a href='init.8.html'><i>init</i>(8)</a>
. 
<h2><a name='sect22' href='#toc22'>Limitations</a></h2>
One
thing that <i>xdm</i> isn't very good at doing is coexisting with other window
