This driver has a special requirement that needs
to be fulfilled before it will work: You need Glide installed and you need
to make a link for the libglide2x.so file. Read the second paragraph in the
description below to find out how. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
<b>glide </b> is an XFree86 driver
for Glide capable video boards (such as 3Dfx Voodoo boards). This driver
is mainly for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 boards, later boards from 3Dfx have
2D built-in and you should preferably use a driver separate for those boards
or the <a href='fbdev.4.html'>fbdev(4)</a>
 driver. This driver is a bit special because Voodoo 1 and
2 boards are very much NOT made for running 2D graphics. Therefore, this
driver uses no hardware acceleration (since there is no acceleration for
2D, only 3D). Instead it is implemented with the help of a "shadow" framebuffer
that resides entirely in RAM. Selected portions of this shadow framebuffer
are then copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this,
the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. But since the CPU
is nowadays actually rather fast at moving data, we get very good speed
anyway, especially since the whole shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.
<p>
This driver requires that you have installed Glide. (Which can, at the time
of this writing, be found at http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html). Also,
you need to tell XFree86 where the libglide2x.so file is placed by making
a soft link in the /usr/X11R6/lib/modules directory that points to the
libglide2x.so file. For example (if your libglide2x.so file is in /usr/lib):
<p>
  # ln -s /usr/lib/libglide2x.so /usr/X11R6/lib/modules <p>
If you have installed
/dev/3dfx, the driver will be able to turn on the MTRR registers (through
the glide library) if you have a CPU with such registers (see http://glide.xxedgexx.com/MTRR.html).
This will speed up copying data to the Voodoo board by as much as 2.7 times
and is very noticeable since this driver copies a lot of data... Highly recommended.
<p>
This driver supports 16 and 24 bit color modes. The 24 bit color mode uses
a 32 bit framebuffer (it has no support for 24 bit packed-pixel framebuffers).
Notice that the Voodoo boards can only display 16 bit color, but the shadow
framebuffer can be run in 24 bit color. The point of supporting 24 bit mode
is that this enables you to run in a multihead configuration with Xinerama
together with another board that runs in real 24 bit color mode. (All boards
must run the same color depth when you use Xinerama). <p>
Resolutions supported
are: 640x480, 800x600, 960x720, 1024x768, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200. Note
that not all modes will work on all Voodoo boards. It seems that Voodoo
2 boards support no higher than 1024x768 and Voodoo 1 boards can go to
800x600. If you see a message like this in the output from the server: <p>

 (EE) GLIDE(0): grSstWinOpen returned ...<br>
 <p>
Then you are probably trying to use a resolution that is supported by
the driver but not supported by the hardware. <p>
Refresh rates supported are:
60Hz, 75Hz and 85Hz. The refresh rate used is derived from the normal mode
line according to the following table: 
<dl>

<dt>Mode-line refresh rate </dt>
<dd>Used refresh
rate <br>
</dd>

<dt>   0-74 Hz </dt>
<dd>  60 Hz<br>
 <br>
</dd>

<dt>  74-84 Hz </dt>
<dd>  75 Hz<br>
 <br>
</dd>

<dt>  84-   Hz </dt>
<dd>  85 Hz<br>
 </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Thus, if you use a modeline that for example has a 70Hz refresh rate 
you will only get a 60Hz refresh rate in actuality. <p>
Selecting which Voodoo
board to use with the driver is done by using an option called "GlideDevice"
in the "Device" section. (If you don't have this option present then the
first board found will be selected for that Device section). For example:
To use the first Voodoo board, use a "Device" section like this, for example:
<p>
Section "Device" <br>
   Identifier  "Voodoo"<br>
 <br>
   Driver      "glide"<br>
 <br>
   Option      "dpms" "on"<br>
 <br>
   Option      "GlideDevice" "0"<br>
 <br>
EndSection <p>
And if you have more than one Voodoo board, add another "Device"
section with a GlideDevice option with value 1, and so on. (You can use
more than one Voodoo board, but SLI configured boards will be treated as
a single board.) <p>
Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported. <p>
Limited
support for DPMS screen saving is available. The "standby" and "suspend"
modes are just painting the screen black. The "off" mode turns the Voodoo
board off and thus works correctly. <p>
This driver does not support a virtual
screen size different from the display size. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Supported Hardware</a></h2>
The <b>glide</b>
driver supports any board that can be used with Glide (such as 3Dfx Voodoo
boards) 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Configuration Details</a></h2>
Please refer to <a href='XF86Config.5.html'>XF86Config(5)</a>
 for general
configuration details.  This section only covers configuration details specific
to this driver. <p>
The following driver <b>Options</b> are supported: 
<dl>

<dt><b>Option "OnAtExit"
"</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>If true, will leave the Voodoo board on when the server exits.
Useful in a multihead setup when only the Voodoo board is connected to
a second monitor and you don't want that monitor to lose signal when you
quit the server. Put this option in the Device section. Default: off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"GlideDevice" "</b><i>integer</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Selects which Voodoo board to use. (Or boards, in
an SLI configuration). The value should be 0 for the first board, 1 for
the second and so on. If it is not present, the first Voodoo board found
will be selected. Put this option in the Device section. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Example</a></h2>
Here is an
example of a part of an XF86Config file that uses a multihead configuration
with two monitors. The first monitor is driven by the fbdev video driver
and the second monitor is driven by the glide driver. <p>

If you use this configuration file and start the server with
the +xinerama command line option, the two monitors will be showing a single
large area where windows can be moved between monitors and overlap from
one monitor to the other. Starting the X server with the Xinerama extension
can be done for example like this: <p>
$ xinit -- +xinerama
