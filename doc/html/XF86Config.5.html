<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
XF86Config - Configuration File for XFree86 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Introduction</a></h2>
<b>XFree86</b>
supports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration and run-time
parameters: command line options, environment variables, the XF86Config
configuration file, auto-detection, and fallback defaults. When the same
information is supplied in more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism
is used.  The list of mechanisms is ordered from highest precedence to lowest.
 Note that not all parameters can be supplied via all methods.  The available
command line options and environment variables (and some defaults) are
described in the <a href='Xserver.1.html'>Xserver(1)</a>
 and <a href='XFree86.1.html'>XFree86(1)</a>
 manual pages.  Most configuration
file parameters, with their defaults, are described below.  Driver and module
specific configuration parameters are described in the relevant driver
or module manual page. <p>
Starting with version 4.4, <b>XFree86</b> has support for
generating a usable configuration at run-time when no <b>XF86Config</b> file is
provided.  The initial version of this automatic configuration support is
targeted at the most popular hardware and software platforms supported
by XFree86.  Some details about how this works can be found in the <a href='XFree86.1.html'>XFree86(1)</a>

and <a href='getconfig.1.html'>getconfig(1)</a>
 manual pages. <p>
Starting with version 4.5, it is possible
for this automatically generated configuration to supplement a partial
static configuration.  The partial static configuration can be used to provide
non-default configuration details for things that are not currently handled
by the automatic configuration mechanism. 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>XFree86</b> uses a configuration
file called <b>XF86Config</b> for its initial setup.  This configuration file is
searched for in the following places when the server is started as a normal
user: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><i>/etc/X11/</i>&lt;cmdline&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/</i>&lt;cmdline&gt;
<i>/etc/X11/</i><b>$XF86CONFIG</b>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/</i><b>$XF86CONFIG</b>
<i>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/etc/X11/XF86Config</i>
<i>/etc/XF86Config</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config.</i>&lt;hostname&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.</i>&lt;hostname&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</i>
</pre></dl>
<p>
where <i>&lt;cmdline&gt;</i> is a relative path (with no ".." components) specified with
the <b>-xf86config</b> command line option, <b>$XF86CONFIG</b> is the relative path (with
no ".." components) specified by that environment variable, and <i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>
is the machine's hostname as reported by <a href='gethostname.3.html'>gethostname(3)</a>
. <p>
When the XFree86
server is started by the "root" user, the config file search locations
are as follows: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre>&lt;cmdline&gt;
<i>/etc/X11/</i>&lt;cmdline&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/</i>&lt;cmdline&gt;
<b>$XF86CONFIG</b>
<i>/etc/X11/</i><b>$XF86CONFIG</b>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/</i><b>$XF86CONFIG</b>
<b>$HOME</b><i>/XF86Config</i>
<i>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/etc/X11/XF86Config</i>
<i>/etc/XF86Config</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config.</i>&lt;hostname&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.</i>&lt;hostname&gt;
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config-4</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</i>
</pre></dl>
<p>
where <i>&lt;cmdline&gt;</i> is the path specified with the <b>-xf86config</b> command line option
(which may be absolute or relative), <b>$XF86CONFIG</b> is the path specified
by that environment variable (absolute or relative), <b>$HOME</b> is the path
specified by that environment variable (usually the home directory), and
<i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i> is the machine's hostname as reported by <a href='gethostname.3.html'>gethostname(3)</a>
. <p>
The <b>XF86Config</b>
file is composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order.
 Each section has the form: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section  "</b><i>SectionName</i><b>"</b>
    <i>SectionEntry</i>
    ...
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The section names are: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Files          </b>File pathnames
<b>ServerFlags    </b>Server flags
<b>Module         </b>Dynamic module loading
<b>InputDevice    </b>Input device description
<b>Device         </b>Graphics device description
<b>VideoAdaptor   </b>Xv video adaptor description
<b>Monitor        </b>Monitor description
<b>Modes          </b>Video modes descriptions
<b>Screen         </b>Screen configuration
<b>ServerLayout   </b>Overall layout
<b>DRI            </b>DRI-specific configuration
<b>Vendor         </b>Vendor-specific configuration
</pre></dl>
<p>
The following obsolete section names are still recognised for compatibility
purposes.  In new config files, the <b>InputDevice</b> section should be used instead.
<p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Keyboard       </b>Keyboard configuration
<b>Pointer        </b>Pointer/mouse configuration
</pre></dl>
<p>
The old <b>XInput</b> section is no longer recognised. <p>
The <b>ServerLayout</b> sections
are at the highest level.  They bind together the input and output devices
that will be used in a session.  The input devices are described in the
<b>InputDevice</b> sections.  Output devices usually consist of multiple independent
components (e.g., and graphics board and a monitor).  These multiple components
are bound together in the <b>Screen</b> sections, and it is these that are referenced
by the <b>ServerLayout</b> section.  Each <b>Screen</b> section binds together a graphics
board and a monitor.  The graphics boards are described in the <b>Device</b> sections,
and the monitors are described in the <b>Monitor</b> sections. <p>
Config file keywords
are case-insensitive, and "_" characters are ignored.  Most strings (including
<b>Option</b> names) are also case-insensitive, and insensitive to white space
and "_" characters. <p>
Each config file entry usually takes up a single line
in the file. They consist of a keyword, which is possibly followed by one
or more arguments, with the number and types of the arguments depending
on the keyword.  The argument types are: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Integer     </b>an integer number in decimal, hex or octal
<b>Real        </b>a floating point number
<b>String      </b>a string enclosed in double quote marks (")
</pre></dl>
<p>
Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with "0x", and octal values with
"0". <p>
A special keyword called <b>Option</b> may be used to provide free-form data
to various components of the server. The <b>Option</b> keyword takes either one
or two string arguments.  The first is the option name, and the optional
second argument is the option value.  Some commonly used option value types
include: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Integer     </b>an integer number in decimal, hex or octal
<b>Real        </b>a floating point number
<b>String      </b>a sequence of characters
<b>Boolean     </b>a boolean value (see below)
<b>Frequency   </b>a frequency value (see below)
</pre></dl>
<p>
Note that <i>all</i> <b>Option</b> values, not just strings, must be enclosed in quotes.
<p>
Boolean options may optionally have a value specified.  When no value is
specified, the option's value is <b>TRUE</b>. The following boolean option values
are recognised as <b>TRUE</b>: <p>
<dl><b>1</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>yes</b> </dl>
<p>
and the following boolean option
values are recognised as <b>FALSE</b>: <p>
<dl><b>0</b>, <b>off</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>no</b> </dl>
<p>
If an option name is
prefixed with "<b>No</b>", then the option value is negated. <p>
Example: the following
option entries are equivalent: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Option "Accel"   "Off"</b>
<b>Option "NoAccel"</b>
<b>Option "NoAccel" "On"</b>
<b>Option "Accel"   "false"</b>
<b>Option "Accel"   "no"</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
Frequency option values consist of a real number that is optionally followed
by one of the following frequency units: <p>
<dl><b>Hz</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>kHz</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>MHz</b> </dl>
<p>
When the unit
name is omitted, the correct units will be determined from the value and
the expectations of the appropriate range of the value. It is recommended
that the units always be specified when using frequency option values to
avoid any errors in determining the value. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Files Section</a></h2>
The config file
may have multiple <b>Files</b> sections.  These are used to specify some path names
required by the server.  Earlier <b>Files</b> sections have priority over later
sections.  This means that a path name specified in a <b>Files</b> section cannot
be overridden by a later <b>Files</b> section (this behaviour may change in the
future).  Some of these paths can also be set from the command line (see
<a href='Xserver.1.html'>Xserver(1)</a>
 and <a href='XFree86.1.html'>XFree86(1)</a>
). The command line settings override the values
specified in the config file.  The <b>Files</b> section is optional, as are all
of the entries that may appear in it. <p>
The entries that can appear in this
section are: 
<dl>

<dt><b>Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies an optional identifying name for
the <b>Files</b> section. </dd>

<dt><b>FontPath "</b><i>path</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the search path for fonts.  This
path is a comma separated list of font path elements which the XFree86
server searches for font databases. Multiple <b>FontPath</b> entries may be specified,
and they will be concatenated to build up the fontpath used by the server.
 Font path elements may be either absolute directory paths, or a font server
identifier.  Font server identifiers have the form: </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl><i>&lt;trans&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;port-number&gt;</i>
</dl>
<p>
<dl>where <i>&lt;trans&gt;</i> is the transport type to use to connect to the font server
(e.g., <b>unix</b> for UNIX-domain sockets or <b>tcp</b> for a TCP/IP connection), <i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>
is the hostname of the machine running the font server, and <i>&lt;port-number&gt;</i>
is the port number that the font server is listening on (usually 7100).
<p>
When this entry is not specified in the config file, the server falls back
to the compiled-in default font path, which contains the following font
path elements: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/</i>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The recommended font path contains the following font path elements: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/</i>
<i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/</i>
</pre></dl>
<p>
Font path elements that are found to be invalid are removed from the font
path when the server starts up. </dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>RGBPath "</b><i>path</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the path name for the
RGB color database. When this entry is not specified in the config file,
the server falls back to the compiled-in default RGB path, which is: </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl><i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb</i>
</dl>
<p>
Note that an implicit <i>.txt</i> is added to this path if the server was compiled
to use text rather than binary format RGB color databases. 
<dl>

<dt><b>ModulePath "</b><i>path</i><b>"</b>
</dt>
<dd>sets the search path for loadable XFree86 server modules.  This path is
a comma separated list of directories which the XFree86 server searches
for loadable modules loading in the order specified.  Multiple <b>ModulePath</b>
entries may be specified, and they will be concatenated to build the module
search path used by the server. 
<!--
  The LogFile keyword is not currently implemented
 
-->
</dd>

<dt><b>Options</b> </dt>
<dd>Option flags may be specified in
<b>Files</b> sections. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Serverflags Section</a></h2>
The config file may have multiple <b>ServerFlags</b>
sections.  These are used to specify some global XFree86 server options.
Earlier <b>ServerFlags</b> sections have priority over later sections.  This means
that an option specified in a <b>ServerFlags</b> section cannot be overridden
by a later <b>ServerFlags</b> section.  Except for the <b>Identifier</b> entry, all of
the entries in this section are <b>Options</b>, although for compatibility purposes
some of the old style entries are still recognised.  Those old style entries
are not documented here, and using them is discouraged.  The <b>ServerFlags</b>
section is optional, as are the entries that may be specified in it. <p>
<b>Options</b>
specified in this section (with the exception of the <b>"DefaultServerLayout"</b>
<b>Option</b>) may be overridden by <b>Options</b> specified in the active <b>ServerLayout</b>
section.  Options with command line equivalents are overridden when their
command line equivalent is used.  Entries recognised by this section are:

<dl>

<dt><b>Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies an optional identifying name for the <b>ServerFlags</b>
section. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "DefaultServerLayout"  "</b><i>layout-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This specifies the default
<b>ServerLayout</b> section to use in the absence of the <b>-layout</b> command line option.
</dd>

<dt><b>Option "NoTrapSignals"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This prevents the XFree86 server from
trapping a range of unexpected fatal signals and exiting cleanly.  Instead,
the XFree86 server will die and drop core where the fault occurred.  The
default behaviour is for the XFree86 server to exit cleanly, but still
drop a core file.  In general you never want to use this option unless you
are debugging an XFree86 server problem and know how to deal with the consequences.
</dd>

<dt><b>Option "DontVTSwitch"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This disallows the use of the <b>Ctrl+Alt+F</b><i>n</i>
sequence (where F<i>n</i> refers to one of the numbered function keys).  That sequence
is normally used to switch to another "virtual terminal" on operating systems
that have this feature.  When this option is enabled, that key sequence
has no special meaning and is passed to clients.  Default: off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "DontZap"
 "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This disallows the use of the <b>Ctrl+Alt+Backspace</b> sequence.  That
sequence is normally used to terminate the XFree86 server. When this option
is enabled, that key sequence has no special meaning and is passed to clients.
 Default: off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "DontZoom"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This disallows the use of the
<b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus</b> and <b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus</b> sequences.  These sequences
allows you to switch between video modes. When this option is enabled, those
key sequences have no special meaning and are passed to clients.  Default:
off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "DisableVidModeExtension"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This disables the parts
of the VidMode extension used by the xvidtune client that can be used to
change the video modes.  Default: the VidMode extension is enabled. </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"AllowNonLocalXvidtune"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This allows the xvidtune client (and
other clients that use the VidMode extension) to connect from another host.
 Default: off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "DisableModInDev"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This disables the parts
of the XFree86-Misc extension that can be used to modify the input device
settings dynamically.  Default: that functionality is enabled. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "AllowNonLocalModInDev"
 "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This allows a client to connect from another host and change
keyboard and mouse settings in the running server.  Default: off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"AllowMouseOpenFail"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This allows the server to start up even
if the mouse device can't be opened/initialised.  Default: false. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "VTInit"
 "</b><i>command</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Runs <i>command</i> after the VT used by the server has been opened.
The command string is passed to "/bin/sh -c", and is run with the real user's
id with stdin and stdout set to the VT.  The purpose of this option is to
allow system dependent VT initialisation commands to be run.  This option
should rarely be needed.  Default: not set. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "VTSysReq"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b>
</dt>
<dd>enables the SYSV-style VT switch sequence for non-SYSV systems which support
VT switching.  This sequence is <b>Alt-SysRq</b> followed by a function key (<b>Fn</b>).
This prevents the XFree86 server trapping the keys used for the default
VT switch sequence, which means that clients can access them.  Default:
off. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "XkbDisable" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>disable/enable the XKEYBOARD extension.
 The -kb command line option overrides this config file option.  Default:
XKB is enabled. 
<!--
  The following four options are "undocumented".
 
-->
</dd>

<dt><b>Option "BlankTime"  "</b><i>time</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the inactivity timeout
for the blanking phase of the screensaver. <i>time</i> is in minutes.  This is equivalent
to the XFree86 server's `-s' flag, and the value can be changed at run-time
with <a href='xset.1.html'>xset(1)</a>
.  Default: 10 minutes. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "StandbyTime"  "</b><i>time</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the
inactivity timeout for the "standby" phase of DPMS mode. <i>time</i> is in minutes,
and the value can be changed at run-time with <a href='xset.1.html'>xset(1)</a>
. Default: 20 minutes.
 This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be
supported by all video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens that have
the <b>"DPMS"</b> option set (see the MONITOR section below). </dd>

<dt><b>Option "SuspendTime"
 "</b><i>time</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the inactivity timeout for the "suspend" phase of DPMS mode.
<i>time</i> is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with <a href='xset.1.html'>xset(1)</a>
.
Default: 30 minutes.  This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors,
and may not be supported by all video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens
that have the <b>"DPMS"</b> option set (see the MONITOR section below). </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"OffTime"  "</b><i>time</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>sets the inactivity timeout for the "off" phase of DPMS
mode. <i>time</i> is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with <a href='xset.1.html'>xset(1)</a>
.
Default: 40 minutes.  This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors,
and may not be supported by all video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens
that have the <b>"DPMS"</b> option set (see the MONITOR section below). </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"Pixmap"  "</b><i>bpp</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This sets the pixmap format to use for depth 24.  Allowed
values for <i>bpp</i> are 24 and 32.  Default: 32 unless driver constraints don't
allow this (which is rare).  Note: some clients don't behave well when this
value is set to 24. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "PC98"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Specify that the machine is
a Japanese PC-98 machine.  This should not be enabled for anything other
than the Japanese-specific PC-98 architecture.  Default: auto-detected. 
<!--
  Doubt this should be documented.
 
-->
</dd>

<dt><b>Option
"Log"  "</b><i>logflag</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables special handling for log files that
may be useful when debugging certain types of problems.  The values for
<i>logflag</i> are <b>Flush</b> and <b>Sync</b>. <b>Flush</b> causes the log file buffer to be flushed
after each write. <b>Sync</b> causes the log file buffer to be flushed and the
file data to be written to the disk after each write.  The default is for
neither of these flags to be enabled.  Enabling these flags during normal
operation may degrade performance and/or lengthen startup time. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "NoPM"
 "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Disables something to do with power management events.  Default:
PM enabled on platforms that support it. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "Xinerama"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>enable
or disable XINERAMA extension. Default is disabled. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "AllowDeactivateGrabs"
"</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables the use of the <b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Divide</b> key
sequence to deactivate any active keyboard and mouse grabs.  Default: off.
</dd>

<dt><b>Option "AllowClosedownGrabs" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This option enables the use of the
<b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply</b> key sequence to kill clients with an active keyboard
or mouse grab as well as killing any application that may have locked the
server, normally using the <a href='XGrabServer.3.html'>XGrabServer(3)</a>
 Xlib function.  Default: off. <br>
Note that the options <b>AllowDeactivateGrabs</b> and <b>AllowClosedownGrabs</b> will
allow users to remove the grab used by screen saver/locker programs. An
API was written to such cases. If you enable this option, make sure your
screen saver/locker is updated. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "HandleSpecialKeys" "</b><i>when</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This option
controls when the server uses the builtin handler to process special key
combinations (such as <b>Ctrl+Alt+Backspace</b>). Normally the XKEYBOARD extension
keymaps will provide mappings for each of the special key combinations,
so the builtin handler is not needed unless the XKEYBOARD extension is
disabled.  The value of <i>when</i> can be <b>Always</b>, <b>Never</b>, or <b>WhenNeeded</b>. Default:
Use the builtin handler only if needed.  The server will scan the keymap
for a mapping to the <b>Terminate</b> action and, if found, use XKEYBOARD for
processing actions, otherwise the builtin handler will be used. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Module Section</a></h2>
The
config file may have multiple <b>Module</b> section.  They are used to specify
additional XFree86 server modules to be loaded.  This section is ignored
when the XFree86 server is built in static form.  The types of modules normally
loaded in this section are XFree86 server extension modules, and font rasteriser
modules.  Most other module types are loaded automatically when they are
needed via other mechanisms.  The <b>Module</b> section is optional, as are all
of the entries that may be specified in it. <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies
an optional identifying name for the <b>Module</b> section. </dd>

<dt><b>Options</b> </dt>
<dd>Option flags
may be specified in <b>Module</b> sections. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Entries that identify which modules
to pre-load may be in two forms. The first and most commonly used form is
an entry that uses the <b>Load</b> keyword, as described here: 
<dl>

<dt><b>Load  "</b><i>modulename</i><b>"</b>
</dt>
<dd>This instructs the server to load the module called <i>modulename</i>. The module
name given should be the module's standard name, not the module file name.
 The standard name is case-sensitive, and does not include the "lib" prefix,
or the ".a", ".o", or ".so" suffixes. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl>Example: the Type 1 font rasteriser can
be loaded with the following entry: <p>
<dl><b>Load "type1"</b> </dl>
</dl>
<p>
The second form of entry
is a <b>SubSection,</b> with the subsection name being the module name, and the
contents of the <b>SubSection</b> being <b>Options</b> that are passed to the module
when it is loaded. <p>
Example: the extmod module (which contains a miscellaneous
group of server extensions) can be loaded, with the XFree86-DGA extension
disabled by using the following entry: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>SubSection "extmod"</b>
<b>   Option  "omit XFree86-DGA"</b>
<b>EndSubSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
Modules are searched for in each directory specified in the <b>ModulePath</b>
search path, and in the drivers, input, extensions, fonts, and internal
subdirectories of each of those directories. In addition to this, operating
system specific subdirectories of all the above are searched first if they
exist. <p>
To see what font and extension modules are available, check the contents
of the following directories: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/fonts
/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions
</pre></dl>
<p>
The "bitmap" font modules is loaded automatically.  It is recommended that
at very least the "extmod" extension module be loaded.  If it isn't some
commonly used server extensions (like the SHAPE extension) will not be
available. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Inputdevice Section</a></h2>
The config file may have multiple <b>InputDevice</b>
sections.  There will normally be at least two: one for the core (primary)
keyboard, and one of the core pointer.  If either of these two is missing,
a default configuration for the missing ones will be used.  Currently the
default configuration may not work as expected on all platforms. <p>
<b>InputDevice</b>
sections have the following format: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section "InputDevice"</b>
<b>    Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
<b>    Driver     "</b><i>inputdriver</i><b>"</b>
<i>    options</i>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The <b>Identifier</b> and <b>Driver</b> entries are required in all <b>InputDevice</b> sections.
 All other entries are optional. <p>
The <b>Identifier</b> entry specifies the unique
name for this input device.  The <b>Driver</b> entry specifies the name of the
driver to use for this input device. When using the loadable server, the
input driver module "<i>inputdriver</i>"<i></i> will be loaded for each active <b>InputDevice</b>
section.  An <b>InputDevice</b> section is considered active if it is referenced
by an active <b>ServerLayout</b> section, if it is referenced by the <b>-keyboard</b>
or <b>-pointer</b> command line options, or if it is selected implicitly as the
core pointer or keyboard device in the absence of such explicit references.
The most commonly used input drivers are "keyboard" and "mouse". <p>
In the
absence of an explicitly specified core input device, the first <b>InputDevice</b>
marked as <b>CorePointer</b> (or <b>CoreKeyboard</b>) is used.  If there is no match there,
the first <b>InputDevice</b> that uses the "mouse" (or "keyboard" or "kbd") driver
is used.  The final fallback is to use built-in default configurations. <p>
<b>InputDevice</b>
sections recognise some driver-independent <b>Options</b>, which are described
here.  See the individual input driver manual pages for a description of
the device-specific options. 
<dl>

<dt><b>Option "CorePointer"</b> </dt>
<dd>When this is set, the input
device is installed as the core (primary) pointer device.  There must be
exactly one core pointer.  If this option is not set here, or in the <b>ServerLayout</b>
section, or from the <b>-pointer</b> command line option, then the first input
device that is capable of being used as a core pointer will be selected
as the core pointer. This option is implicitly set when the obsolete <b>Pointer</b>
section is used. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "CoreKeyboard"</b> </dt>
<dd>When this is set, the input device
is to be installed as the core (primary) keyboard device.  There must be
exactly one core keyboard.  If this option is not set here, in the <b>ServerLayout</b>
section, or from the <b>-keyboard</b> command line option, then the first input
device that is capable of being used as a core keyboard will be selected
as the core keyboard. This option is implicitly set when the obsolete <b>Keyboard</b>
section is used. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "AlwaysCore"  "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>Option "SendCoreEvents"
 "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Both of these options are equivalent, and when enabled cause
the input device to always report core events.  This can be used, for example,
to allow an additional pointer device to generate core pointer events (like
moving the cursor, etc). </dd>

<dt><b>Option "HistorySize"  "</b><i>number</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Sets the motion
history size.  Default: 0. </dd>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Device
Section</a></h2>
The config file may have multiple <b>Device</b> sections.  There must be
at least one, for the video card being used. <p>
<b>Device</b> sections have the following

<pre><b>Section "Device"</b>
<b>    Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
<b>    Driver     "</b><i>driver</i><b>"</b>
<i>    entries</i>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The <b>Identifier</b> and <b>Driver</b> entries are required in all <b>Device</b> sections. 
All other entries are optional. <p>
The <b>Identifier</b> entry specifies the unique
name for this graphics device.  The <b>Driver</b> entry specifies the name of the
driver to use for this graphics device. When using the loadable server,
the driver module "<i>driver</i>"<i></i> will be loaded for each active <b>Device</b> section.
 A <b>Device</b> section is considered active if it is referenced by an active
<b>Screen</b> section. <p>
<b>Device</b> sections recognise some driver-independent entries
and <b>Options</b>, which are described here.  Not all drivers make use of these
driver-independent entries, and many of those that do don't require them
to be specified because the information is auto-detected.  See the individual
graphics driver manual pages for further information about this, and for
a description of the device-specific options. Note that most of the <b>Options</b>
listed here (but not the other entries) may be specified in the <b>Screen</b>
section instead of here in the <b>Device</b> section. 
<dl>

<dt><b>BusID  "</b><i>bus-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This specifies
the bus location of the graphics card.  For PCI/AGP cards, the <i>bus-id</i> string
has the form <b>PCI:</b><i>bus</i><b>:</b><i>device</i><b>:</b><i>function</i> (e.g., "PCI:1:0:0" might be appropriate
for an AGP card). This field is usually optional in single-head configurations
when using the primary graphics card.  In multi-head configurations, or when
using a secondary graphics card in a single-head configuration, this entry
is mandatory.  Its main purpose is to make an unambiguous connection between
the device section and the hardware it is representing.  This information
can usually be found by running the XFree86 server with the <b>-scanpci</b> command
line option. </dd>

<dt><b>Screen  </b><i>number</i> </dt>
<dd>This option is mandatory for cards where a single
PCI entity can drive more than one display (i.e., multiple CRTCs sharing
a single graphics accelerator and video memory).  One <b>Device</b> section is
required for each head, and this parameter determines which head each of
the <b>Device</b> sections applies to.  The legal values of <i>number</i> range from 0
to one less than the total number of heads per entity. Most drivers require
that the primary screen (0) be present. </dd>

<dt><b>Chipset  "</b><i>chipset</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This usually
optional entry specifies the chipset used on the graphics board.  In most
cases this entry is not required because the drivers will probe the hardware
to determine the chipset type.  Don't specify it unless the driver-specific
documentation recommends that you do. </dd>

<dt><b>Ramdac  "</b><i>ramdac-type</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional
entry specifies the type of RAMDAC used on the graphics board.  This is
only used by a few of the drivers, and in most cases it is not required
because the drivers will probe the hardware to determine the RAMDAC type
where possible.  Don't specify it unless the driver-specific documentation
recommends that you do. </dd>

<dt><b>DacSpeed  </b><i>speed</i> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>DacSpeed  </b><i>speed-8 speed-16 speed-24
speed-32</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the RAMDAC speed rating (which is
usually printed on the RAMDAC chip).  The speed is in MHz.  When one value
is given, it applies to all framebuffer pixel sizes.  When multiple values
are give, they apply to the framebuffer pixel sizes 8, 16, 24 and 32 respectively.
 This is not used by many drivers, and only needs to be specified when
the speed rating of the RAMDAC is different from the defaults built in
to driver, or when the driver can't auto-detect the correct defaults.  Don't
specify it unless the driver-specific documentation recommends that you
do. </dd>

<dt><b>Clocks  </b><i>clock ...</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies the pixel that are on your graphics board. 
The clocks are in MHz, and may be specified as a floating point number.
 The value is stored internally to the nearest kHz.  The ordering of the
clocks is important.  It must match the order in which they are selected
on the graphics board.  Multiple <b>Clocks</b> lines may be specified, and each
is concatenated to form the list.  Most drivers do not use this entry, and
it is only required for some older boards with non-programmable clocks. 
Don't specify this entry unless the driver-specific documentation explicitly
recommends that you do. </dd>

<dt><b>ClockChip  "</b><i>clockchip-type</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry is
used to specify the clock chip type on graphics boards which have a programmable
clock generator.  Only a few XFree86 drivers support programmable clock
chips.  For details, see the appropriate driver manual page. </dd>

<dt><b>VideoRam  </b><i>mem</i>
</dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the amount of video ram that is installed
on the graphics board. This is measured in kBytes.  In most cases this is
not required because the XFree86 server probes the graphics board to determine
this quantity.  The driver-specific documentation should indicate when it
might be needed. </dd>

<dt><b>BiosBase  </b><i>baseaddress</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the
base address of the video BIOS for the VGA board.  This address is normally
auto-detected, and should only be specified if the driver-specific documentation
recommends it. </dd>

<dt><b>MemBase  </b><i>baseaddress</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the memory
base address of a graphics board's linear frame buffer.  This entry is not
used by many drivers, and it should only be specified if the driver-specific
documentation recommends it. </dd>

<dt><b>IOBase  </b><i>baseaddress</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies
the IO base address.  This entry is not used by many drivers, and it should
only be specified if the driver-specific documentation recommends it. </dd>

<dt><b>ChipID
 </b><i>id</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies a numerical ID representing the chip
type. For PCI cards, it is usually the device ID.  This can be used to override
the auto-detection, but that should only be done when the driver-specific
documentation recommends it. </dd>

<dt><b>ChipRev  </b><i>rev</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies
the chip revision number.  This can be used to override the auto-detection,
but that should only be done when the driver-specific documentation recommends
it. </dd>

<dt><b>TextClockFreq  </b><i>freq</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the pixel clock frequency
that is used for the regular text mode.  The frequency is specified in MHz.
 This is rarely used. </dd>

<dt><b>IRQ </b><i>interrupt-number</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry allows an
interrupt number to be specified. </dd>

<dt><b>Options</b> </dt>
<dd>Option flags may be specified
in the <b>Device</b> sections.  These include driver-specific options and driver-independent
options.  The former are described in the driver-specific documentation. Some
of the latter are described below in the section about the <b>Screen</b> section,
and they may also be included here.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Videoadaptor Section</a></h2>
The config file
may have multiple <b>VideoAdaptor</b> sections, which may be referenced from <b>Screen</b>

<p>
The only mandatory entry in a <b>VideoAdaptor</b> section is the <b>Identifier</b>. Other
entries include: 
<dl>

<dt><b>VendorName  "</b><i>vendor</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the
video adaptor's manufacturer. </dd>

</dl>
<p>
The <b>Port</b> <b>SubSections</b> provide information about video adaptor ports.
 Each of these may contain an <b>Identifier</b> entry and <b>Options</b>. 
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Monitor Section</a></h2>
The
config file may have multiple <b>Monitor</b> sections.  There should normally be
at least one, for the monitor being used, but a default configuration will
be created when one isn't specified. <p>
<b>Monitor</b> sections have the following
format: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section "Monitor"</b>
<b>    Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
<i>    entries</i>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The only mandatory entry in a <b>Monitor</b> section is the <b>Identifier</b> entry. <p>
The
<b>Identifier</b> entry specifies the unique name for this monitor.  The <b>Monitor</b>
section provides information about the specifications of the monitor, monitor-specific
<b>Options</b>, and information about the video modes to use with the monitor.
 Specifying video modes is optional because the server now has a built-in
list of VESA standard modes.  When modes are specified explicitly in the
<b>Monitor</b> section (with the <b>Modes</b>, <b>ModeLine</b>, or <b>UseModes</b> keywords), built-in
modes with the same names are not included.  Built-in modes with different
names are, however, still implicitly included. <p>
The entries that may be used
in <b>Monitor</b> sections are described below. 
<dl>

<dt><b>VendorName  "</b><i>vendor</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional
entry specifies the monitor's manufacturer. </dd>

<dt><b>ModelName  "</b><i>model</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional
entry specifies the monitor's model. </dd>

<dt><b>HorizSync  </b><i>horizsync-range</i> </dt>
<dd>gives the
range(s) of horizontal sync frequencies supported by the monitor. <i>horizsync-range</i>
may be a comma separated list of either discrete values or ranges of values.
 A range of values is two values separated by a dash.  By default the values
are in units of kHz.  They may be specified in MHz or Hz if <b>MHz</b> or <b>Hz</b> is
added to the end of the line.  The data given here is used by the XFree86
server to determine if video modes are within the specifications of the
monitor.  This information should be available in the monitor's handbook.
 If this entry is omitted, a default range of 28-33kHz is used. </dd>

<dt><b>VertRefresh
 </b><i>vertrefresh-range</i> </dt>
<dd>gives the range(s) of vertical refresh frequencies supported
by the monitor. <i>vertrefresh-range</i> may be a comma separated list of either
discrete values or ranges of values.  A range of values is two values separated
by a dash.  By default the values are in units of Hz.  They may be specified
in MHz or kHz if <b>MHz</b> or <b>kHz</b> is added to the end of the line.  The data given
here is used by the XFree86 server to determine if video modes are within
the specifications of the monitor.  This information should be available
in the monitor's handbook.  If this entry is omitted, a default range of
43-72Hz is used. </dd>

<dt><b>DisplaySize  </b><i>width height</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry gives the
width and height, in millimetres, of the picture area of the monitor. If
given this is used to calculate the horizontal and vertical pitch (DPI)
of the screen. </dd>

<dt><b>Gamma  </b><i>gamma-value</i> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>Gamma  </b><i>red-gamma green-gamma blue-gamma</i> </dt>
<dd>This
is an optional entry that can be used to specify the gamma correction for
the monitor.  It may be specified as either a single value or as three separate
RGB values.  The values should be in the range 0.1 to 10.0, and the default
is 1.0.  Not all drivers are capable of using this information. </dd>

<dt><b>UseModes 
"</b><i>modesection-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Include the set of modes listed in the <b>Modes</b> section called
<i>modesection-id.</i> This make all of the modes defined in that section available
for use by this monitor. </dd>

<dt><b>Mode  "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This is an optional multi-line entry
that can be used to provide definitions for video modes for the monitor.
 In most cases this isn't necessary because the built-in set of VESA standard
modes will be sufficient.  The <b>Mode</b> keyword indicates the start of a multi-line
video mode description. The mode description is terminated with the <b>EndMode</b>
keyword.  The mode description consists of the following entries: <dl></dd>

<dt><b>DotClock
 </b><i>clock</i> </dt>
<dd>is the dot (pixel) clock rate to be used for the mode. </dd>

<dt><b>HTimings 
</b><i>hdisp hsyncstart hsyncend htotal</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies the horizontal timings for the
mode. </dd>

<dt><b>VTimings  </b><i>vdisp vsyncstart vsyncend vtotal</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies the vertical
timings for the mode. </dd>

<dt><b>Flags  "</b><i>flag</i><b>"</b><i> ...</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies an optional set of mode flags,
each of which is a separate string in double quotes. <b>"Interlace"</b> indicates
that the mode is interlaced. <b>"DoubleScan"</b> indicates a mode where each scanline
is doubled. <b>"+HSync"</b> and <b>"-HSync"</b> can be used to select the polarity of the
HSync signal. <b>"+VSync"</b> and <b>"-VSync"</b> can be used to select the polarity of
the VSync signal. <b>"Composite"</b> can be used to specify composite sync on hardware
where this is supported. Additionally, on some hardware, <b>"+CSync"</b> and <b>"-CSync"</b>
may be used to select the composite sync polarity. </dd>

<dt><b>HSkew  </b><i>hskew</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies
the number of pixels (towards the right edge of the screen) by which the
display enable signal is to be skewed.  Not all drivers use this information.
 This option might become necessary to override the default value supplied
by the server (if any).  "Roving" horizontal lines indicate this value needs
to be increased.  If the last few pixels on a scan line appear on the left
of the screen, this value should be decreased. </dd>

<dt><b>VScan  </b><i>vscan</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies the
number of times each scanline is painted on the screen. Not all drivers
use this information.  Values less than 1 are treated as 1, which is the
default.  Generally, the <b>"DoubleScan"</b> <b>Flag</b> mentioned above doubles this
value. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>ModeLine  "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b><i> mode-description</i> </dt>
<dd>This entry is a more compact version
of the <b>Mode</b> entry, and it also can be used to specify video modes for the
monitor. is a single line format for specifying video modes.  In most cases
this isn't necessary because the built-in set of VESA standard modes will
be sufficient. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl>The <i>mode-description</i> is in four sections, the first three
of which are mandatory.  The first is the dot (pixel) clock.  This is a single
number specifying the pixel clock rate for the mode in MHz.  The second
section is a list of four numbers specifying the horizontal timings.  These
numbers are the <i>hdisp</i>, <i>hsyncstart</i>, <i>hsyncend</i>, and <i>htotal</i> values.  The third
section is a list of four numbers specifying the vertical timings.  These
numbers are the <i>vdisp</i>, <i>vsyncstart</i>, <i>vsyncend</i>, and <i>vtotal</i> values.  The final
section is a list of flags specifying other characteristics of the mode.
<b>Interlace</b> indicates that the mode is interlaced. <b>DoubleScan</b> indicates a
mode where each scanline is doubled. <b>+HSync</b> and <b>-HSync</b> can be used to select
the polarity of the HSync signal. <b>+VSync</b> and <b>-VSync</b> can be used to select
the polarity of the VSync signal. <b>Composite</b> can be used to specify composite
sync on hardware where this is supported. Additionally, on some hardware,
<b>+CSync</b> and <b>-CSync</b> may be used to select the composite sync polarity.  The
<b>HSkew</b> and <b>VScan</b> options mentioned above in the <b>Modes</b> entry description
can also be used here. </dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>Option "DPMS" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Set whether DPMS is enabled
for the monitor.  The default is taken from the monitor's DDC/EDID information
if available, or false if not. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "TargetRefresh" "</b><i>refresh</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Sets a target
refresh rate to use for the monitor.  If the monitor has valid modes with
a refresh rate greater or equal to this value, those with a lower refresh
rate will not be considered when determining the default resolution to
use.  This is improves the default resolution selection when none is specified
explicitly.  Default: <b>TargetRefresh</b> not used. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "SyncOnGreen" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b>
</dt>
<dd>Set whether sync-on-green should be enabled.  The availability of this option
is driver-specific.  Default: false. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "PreferredMode" "</b><i>Xres</i><b>x</b><i>Yres</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Sets
a preferred resolution to use for the default mode.  By default the preferred
mode resolution is taken from the DDC/EDID data if it is available and
if it is provides a default mode preference.  This is typically true for
flat panel displays, which have a native/preferred resolution. This option
is not used if the <b>UsePreferredMode</b> option is false. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "UsePreferredMode"
"</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Controls whether or not a preferred mode, either detected from
the monitor's DDC/EDID data or provided explicitly with the <b>PreferredMode</b>
option, is used.  Default: true. </dd>

The other entries permitted in <b>Modes</b> sections are the <b>Mode</b> and <b>ModeLine</b>
entries that are described above in the <b>Monitor</b> section, as well as <b>Options</b>.

<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Screen Section</a></h2>
The config file may have multiple <b>Screen</b> sections.  There
must be at least one, for the "screen" being used. A "screen" represents
the binding of a graphics device (<b>Device</b> section) and one or more monitors
(<b>Monitor</b> sections).  A <b>Screen</b> section is considered "active" if it is referenced
by an active <b>ServerLayout</b> section or by the <b>-screen</b> command line option.
 If neither of those is present, the first <b>Screen</b> section found in the
config file is considered the active one. <p>
<b>Screen</b> sections have the following
format: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section "Screen"</b>
<b>    Identifier "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
<b>    Device     "</b><i>devid</i><b>"</b>
<b>    Monitor    "</b><i>monid</i><b>"</b>
<i>    entries</i>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>    SubSection "Display"</b>
<i>       entries</i>
<i>       ...</i>
<b>    EndSubSection</b>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
The <b>Identifier</b> and <b>Device</b> entries are mandatory.  All others are optional.
<p>
The <b>Identifier</b> entry specifies the unique name for this screen.  The <b>Screen</b>
section provides information specific to the whole screen, including screen-specific
<b>Options</b>. In multi-head configurations, there will be multiple active <b>Screen</b>
sections, one for each head. The entries available for this section are:

<dl>

<dt><b>Device  "</b><i>device-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This mandatory entry specifies the <b>Device</b> section to
be used for this screen.  This is what ties a specific graphics card to
a screen.  The <i>device-id</i> must match the <b>Identifier</b> of a <b>Device</b> section in
the config file. </dd>

<dt><b>Monitor  </b><i>monitor-num</i><b> "</b><i>monitor-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>One of these entries may
be given for each monitor associated with this screen.  In the absence of
these entries, at least one default monitor will be created for the screen.
The <i>monitor-id</i> field is mandatory, and specifies the <b>Monitor</b> section being
referenced.  The <i>monitor-num</i> field is required when more than one monitor
is being associated with the screen.  Each referenced monitor should be
given a unique monitor number.  This monitor number may be given special
significance by the driver, and it is also used to identify which <b>Display</b>
subsection(s) are associated with the screen/monitor.  If this field is
omitted in a multiple-monitor configuration, default values will be assigned.
 This is not recommended, and this behaviour may change in future revisions.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl>If a <b>Monitor</b> name is not specified, a default configuration is used.  Currently
the default configuration may not function as expected on all platforms.
</dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>VideoAdaptor  "</b><i>xv-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies an optional Xv video adaptor description
to be used with this screen. </dd>

<dt><b>DefaultDepth  </b><i>depth</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies which color depth
the server should use by default.  The <b>-depth</b> command line option can be
used to override this.  If neither is specified, the default depth is driver-specific,
but in most cases is 8. </dd>

<dt><b>DefaultFbBpp  </b><i>bpp</i> </dt>
<dd>specifies which framebuffer layout
to use by default.  The <b>-fbbpp</b> command line option can be used to override
this.  In most cases the driver will chose the best default value for this.
 The only case where there is even a choice in this value is for depth
24, where some hardware supports both a packed 24 bit framebuffer layout
and a sparse 32 bit framebuffer layout. </dd>

<dt><b>Options</b> </dt>
<dd>Various <b>Option</b> flags may
be specified in the <b>Screen</b> section.  Some are driver-specific and are described
in the driver documentation.  Others are driver-independent, and will eventually
be described here. 
<!--
  XXX These should really be in an xaa man page.
 
-->
</dd>

<dt><b>Option "Accel"</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables XAA (X Acceleration Architecture),
a mechanism that makes video cards' 2D hardware acceleration available to
the XFree86 server.  This option is on by default, but it may be necessary
to turn it off if there are bugs in the driver.  There are many options
to disable specific accelerated operations, listed below.  Note that disabling
an operation will have no effect if the operation is not accelerated (whether
due to lack of support in the hardware or in the driver). </dd>

<dt><b>Option "BiosLocation"
"</b><i>address</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the location of the BIOS for the Int10 module. One may select
a BIOS of another card for posting or the legacy V_BIOS range located at
0xc0000 or an alternative address (BUS_ISA).  This is only useful under
very special circumstances and should be used with extreme care. </dd>

<dt><b>Option
"InitPrimary" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Use the Int10 module to initialize the primary
graphics card. Normally, only secondary cards are soft-booted using the Int10
module, as the primary card has already been initialized by the BIOS at
boot time. Default: false. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "NoInt10" "</b><i>boolean</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>Disables the Int10
module, a module that uses the int10 call to the BIOS of the graphics card
to initialize it. Default: false. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "NoMTRR"</b> </dt>
<dd>Disables MTRR (Memory Type
Range Register) support, a feature of modern processors which can improve
video performance by a factor of up to 2.5. Some hardware has buggy MTRR
support, and some video drivers have been known to exhibit problems when
MTRR's are used. </dd>

<dt><b>Option "XaaNoCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"</b> </dt>
<dd>Disables accelerated
rectangular expansion blits from source patterns stored in system memory
(using a memory-mapped aperture). </dd>

<p>
Each
<b>Screen</b> section may optionally contain one or more <b>Display</b> subsections. 
Those subsections provide depth, fbbpp and monitor specific configuration
information, and the ones chosen depend on the depth and/or fbbpp that
is being used for the screen, as well as the monitor number(s) in multi-monitor
configurations.  The <b>Display</b> subsection format is described in the section
below. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>Display Subsection</a></h2>
Each <b>Screen</b> section may have multiple <b>Display</b>
subsections.   The "active" <b>Display</b> subsections are the first for each monitor
number that match the depth and/or fbbpp values being used, or failing
that, the first for each monitor number that has neither a depth or fbbpp
value specified.  Display subsections with no monitor number specified are
used for single monitor per screen configurations.  The <b>Display</b> subsections
are optional.  When there isn't one that matches the monitor number and/or
depth and/or fbbpp values being used, all the parameters that can be specified
here fall back to their defaults. <p>
<b>Display</b> subsections have the following
format: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>    SubSection "Display"</b>
<b>        Monitor  </b><i>monitor-num</i>
<b>        Depth  </b><i>depth</i>
<i>        entries</i>
<i>        ...</i>
<b>    EndSubSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
None of the entries in a <b>Display</b> subsection are mandatory. 
<dl>

<dt><b>Monitor  </b><i>monitor-num</i>
</dt>
<dd>This entry specifies which <b>Monitor</b> entry of the <b>Screen</b> section that this
<b>Display</b> subsection applies to.  This number should match the monitor number
of one of the <b>Monitor</b> references in the <b>Screen</b> screen.  If it doesn't match,
then this <b>Display</b> subsection will be ignored.  If this entry is omitted,
it is applied to single-monitor configurations.  For multi-monitor configurations,
the driver may also use information in this subsection for screen-wide parameters.
 Not all of the parameters in this subsection make sense on a per-monitor
basis.  Which get used and how they get used is currently up to the driver.
 Entries that are relevant to multi-monitor configurations include <b>Modes</b>,
<b>Virtual</b>, <b>ViewPort</b>, and <b>Options</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>Depth  </b><i>depth</i> </dt>
<dd>This entry specifies what colour
depth the <b>Display</b> subsection is to be used for.  This entry is usually specified,
but it may be omitted to create a match-all <b>Display</b> subsection or when wishing
to match only against the <b>FbBpp</b> parameter.  The range of <i>depth</i> values that
are allowed depends on the driver.  Most driver support 8, 15, 16 and 24.
 Some also support 1 and/or 4, and some may support other values (like
30).  Note: <i>depth</i> means the number of bits in a pixel that are actually
used to determine the pixel colour.  32 is not a valid <i>depth</i> value.  Most
hardware that uses 32 bits per pixel only uses 24 of them to hold the colour
information, which means that the colour depth is 24, not 32. </dd>

<dt><b>FbBpp  </b><i>bpp</i>
</dt>
<dd>This entry specifies the framebuffer format this <b>Display</b> subsection is
to be used for.  This entry is only needed when providing depth 24 configurations
that allow a choice between a 24 bpp packed framebuffer format and a 32bpp
sparse framebuffer format.  In most cases this entry should not be used.
</dd>

<dt><b>Weight  </b><i>red-weight green-weight blue-weight</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies
the relative RGB weighting to be used for a screen is being used at depth
16 for drivers that allow multiple formats.  This may also be specified
from the command line with the <b>-weight</b> option (see <a href='XFree86.1.html'>XFree86(1)</a>
). </dd>

<dt><b>Virtual 
</b><i>xdim ydim</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry specifies the virtual screen resolution to
be used. <i>xdim</i> must be a multiple of either 8 or 16 for most drivers, and
a multiple of 32 when running in monochrome mode.  The given value will
be rounded down if this is not the case.  Video modes which are too large
for the specified virtual size will be rejected.  If this entry is not present,
the virtual screen resolution will be set to accommodate all the valid
video modes given in the <b>Modes</b> entry.  Some drivers/hardware combinations
do not support virtual screens. Refer to the appropriate driver-specific
documentation for details. </dd>

<dt><b>ViewPort  </b><i>x0 y0</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry sets the
upper left corner of the initial display. This is only relevant when the
virtual screen resolution is different from the resolution of the initial
video mode.  If this entry is not given, then the initial display will be
centered in the virtual display area. </dd>

<dt><b>Modes  "</b><i>mode-name</i><b>"</b><i> ...</i> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry
specifies the list of video modes to use.  Each <i>mode-name</i> specified must
be in double quotes.  They must correspond to those specified or referenced
in the appropriate <b>Monitor</b> section (including implicitly referenced built-in
VESA standard modes). The server will delete modes from this list which
don't satisfy various requirements.  The first valid mode in this list will
be the default display mode for startup.  The list of valid modes is converted
internally into a circular list.  It is possible to switch to the next mode
with <b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus</b> and to the previous mode with <b>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus</b>.
When this entry is omitted, the valid modes referenced by the appropriate
<b>Monitor</b> section will be used.  If the <b>Monitor</b> section contains no modes,
then the selection will be taken from the built-in VESA standard modes. </dd>

<dt><b>Visual
 "</b><i>visual-name</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd>This optional entry sets the default root visual type.  This
may also be specified from the command line (see the <a href='Xserver.1.html'>Xserver(1)</a>
 man page).
 The visual types available for depth 8 are (default is <b>PseudoColor</b>): </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dd>Option flags
may be specified in the <b>Display</b> subsections.  These may include driver-specific
options and driver-independent options.  The former are described in the

the section about the <b>Screen</b> section, and they may also be included here.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>Serverlayout Section</a></h2>
The config file may have multiple <b>ServerLayout</b> sections.
  A "server layout" represents the binding of one or more screens (<b>Screen</b>
sections) and one or more input devices (<b>InputDevice</b> sections) to form
a complete configuration.  In multi-head configurations, it also specifies
the relative layout of the heads.  A <b>ServerLayout</b> section is considered
"active" if it is referenced by the <b>-layout</b> command line option or by an
<b>Option "DefaultServerLayout"</b> entry in the <b>ServerFlags</b> section (the former
takes precedence over the latter).  If those options are not used, the first
<b>ServerLayout</b> section found in the config file is considered the active
one.  If no <b>ServerLayout</b> sections are present, the single active screen
and two active (core) input devices are selected as described in the relevant
sections above. <p>
<b>ServerLayout</b> sections have the following format: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section "ServerLayout"</b>
<b>    Identifier   "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
<b>    Screen       "</b><i>screen-id</i><b>"</b>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>    InputDevice  "</b><i>idev-id</i><b>"</b>
<i>    ...</i>
<i>    options</i>
<i>    ...</i>
<b>EndSection</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
Each <b>ServerLayout</b> section must have an <b>Identifier</b> entry and at least one
<b>Screen</b> entry. <p>
The <b>Identifier</b> entry specifies the unique name for this server
layout.  The <b>ServerLayout</b> section provides information specific to the whole
session, including session-specific <b>Options</b>. The <b>ServerFlags</b> options (described
above) may be specified here, and ones given here override those given
in the <b>ServerFlags</b> section. <p>
The entries that may be used in this section
are described here. 
<dl>

<dt><b>Screen  </b><i>screen-num</i><b> "</b><i>screen-id</i><b>" </b><i>position-information</i> </dt>
<dd>One
of these entries must be given for each screen being used in a session.
 The <i>screen-id</i> field is mandatory, and specifies the <b>Screen</b> section being
referenced.  The <i>screen-num</i> field is optional, and may be used to specify
the screen number in multi-head configurations.  When this field is omitted,
the screens will be numbered in the order that they are listed in. The numbering
starts from 0, and must be consecutive.  The optional <i>position-information</i>
field describes the way multiple screens are positioned.  When this information
is not provided, the positioning of the screen defaults to <b>Absolute</b> <i>0 0</i>.
There are a number of different ways that this information can be provided:
<dl></dd>

<dt><i>x y</i> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>Absolute  </b><i>x y</i> </dt>
<dd>These both specify that the upper left corner's coordinates
are (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).<i></i> The <b>Absolute</b> keyword is optional.  Some older versions of XFree86
(4.2 and earlier) don't recognise the <b>Absolute</b> keyword, so it's safest to
just specify the coordinates without it. </dd>

<dt><b>RightOf   "</b><i>screen-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>LeftOf   
"</b><i>screen-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>

<dd></dd>

<dt><b>Below     "</b><i>screen-id</i><b>"</b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>Relative  "</b><i>screen-id</i><b>"</b><i>
x y</i> </dt>
<dd>These give the screen's location relative to another screen.  The first
four position the screen immediately to the right, left, above or below
the other screen.  When positioning to the right or left, the top edges
are aligned.  When positioning above or below, the left edges are aligned.
The <b>Relative</b> form specifies the offset of the screen's origin (upper left
corner) relative to the origin of another screen. </dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>InputDevice  "</b><i>idev-id</i><b>"
"</b><i>option</i><b>"</b><i> ...</i> </dt>
<dd>One of these entries should be given for each input device being
used in a session.  Normally at least two are required, one each for the
core pointer and keyboard devices.  If either of those is missing, suitable
<b>InputDevice</b> entries are searched for using the method described above in
the <b>INPUTDEVICE</b> section.  The <i>idev-id</i> field is mandatory, and specifies the
name of the <b>InputDevice</b> section being referenced.  Multiple <i>option</i> fields
may be specified, each in double quotes.  The options permitted here are
any that may also be given in the <b>InputDevice</b> sections.  Normally only session-specific
input device options would be used here.  The most commonly used options
are: </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>"CorePointer"</b>
<b>"CoreKeyboard"</b>
<b>"SendCoreEvents"</b>
</pre></dl>
<p>
<dl>and the first two should normally be used to indicate the core pointer
and core keyboard devices respectively. </dl>

<dl>

<dt><b>Options</b> </dt>
<dd>Any option permitted in
the <b>ServerFlags</b> section may also be specified here.  When the same option
appears in both places, the value given here overrides the one given in
the <b>ServerFlags</b> section. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Here is an example of a <b>ServerLayout</b> section for
a dual headed configuration with two mice: <p>
<dl><br>
<pre><b>Section "ServerLayout"</b>
