Specifies the window. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XMapWindow</i>   function maps the window
and all of its subwindows that have had map requests. Mapping a window that
has an unmapped ancestor does not display the window but marks it as eligible
for display when the ancestor becomes mapped. Such a window is called unviewable.
When all its ancestors are mapped, the window becomes viewable and will
be visible on the screen if it is not obscured by another window. This function
has no effect if the window is already mapped. <p>
If the override-redirect of
the window is <i>False</i>   and if some other client has selected <i>SubstructureRedirectMask</i>
  on the parent window, then the X server generates a <i>MapRequest</i>   event,
and the <i>XMapWindow</i>   function does not map the window. Otherwise, the window
is mapped, and the X server generates a <i>MapNotify</i>   event. <p>
If the window
becomes viewable and no earlier contents for it are remembered, the X server
tiles the window with its background. If the window's background is undefined,
the existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server generates
zero or more  <i>Expose</i>   events. If backing-store was maintained while the
window was unmapped, no  <i>Expose</i>   events are generated. If backing-store
will now be maintained,  a full-window exposure is always generated. Otherwise,
only visible regions may be reported. Similar tiling and exposure take place
for any newly viewable inferiors. <p>
 If the window is an <i>InputOutput</i>   window,
<i>XMapWindow</i>   generates  <i>Expose</i>   events on each  <i>InputOutput</i>   window that
it causes to be displayed. If the client maps and paints the window  and
if the client begins processing events,  the window is painted twice. To
avoid this, first ask for  <i>Expose</i>   events and then map the window, so
the client processes input events as usual. The event list will include
 <i>Expose</i>   for each window that has appeared on the screen.  The client's
normal response to an  <i>Expose</i>   event should be to repaint the window. This
method usually leads to simpler programs and to proper interaction with
window managers. <p>
<i>XMapWindow</i>   can generate a <i>BadWindow</i>   error. <p>
The <i>XMapRaised</i>
  function essentially is similar to <i>XMapWindow</i>   in that it maps the window
and all of its subwindows that have had map requests. However, it also raises
the specified window to the top of the stack. <p>
<i>XMapRaised</i>   can generate
a <i>BadWindow</i>   error. <p>
The <i>XMapSubwindows</i>    function maps all subwindows
for a specified window in top-to-bottom stacking  order. The X server generates
<i>Expose</i>   events on each newly displayed window. This may be much more efficient
than mapping many windows one at a time because the server needs to perform
much of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather than for each
window. <p>
<i>XMapSubwindows</i>   can generate a <i>BadWindow</i>   error.
