<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   function actively grabs
control of the keyboard and generates <i>FocusIn</i>   and <i>FocusOut</i>   events. Further
key events are reported only to the grabbing client. <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   overrides
any active keyboard grab by this client. If owner_events is  <i>False</i>,   all
generated key events are reported with respect to grab_window.   If owner_events
is  <i>True</i>   and if a generated key event would normally be reported to this
client, it is reported normally; otherwise, the event is reported with
respect to the grab_window.   Both  <i>KeyPress</i>   and  <i>KeyRelease</i>   events
are always reported, independent of any event selection made by the client.
<p>
If the keyboard_mode argument is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   keyboard event processing
continues as usual.  If the keyboard is currently frozen by this client,
 then processing of keyboard events is resumed. If the keyboard_mode  argument
is <i>GrabModeSync</i>,   the state of the keyboard (as seen by client applications)
appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events
until the grabbing client issues a releasing  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   call or until
the keyboard grab is released. Actual keyboard changes are not lost while
the keyboard is frozen;  they are simply queued in the server for later
processing. <p>
If pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   pointer event processing
is unaffected by activation of the grab.   If pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,
  the state of the pointer (as seen by client applications) appears to
freeze,  and the X server generates no further pointer events  until the
grabbing client issues a releasing  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   call or until the keyboard
grab is released. Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer
is frozen;  they are simply queued in the server for later processing. <p>
If
the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client, <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>  
fails and returns <i>AlreadyGrabbed</i>.   If grab_window is not viewable, it fails
and returns <i>GrabNotViewable</i>.   If the keyboard is frozen by an active grab
of another client, it fails and returns <i>GrabFrozen</i>.   If the specified time
is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time  or later than the current X
server time, it fails and returns <i>GrabInvalidTime</i>.   Otherwise, the last-keyboard-grab
time is set to the specified time (<i>CurrentTime</i>   is replaced by the current
X server time). <p>
<i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   can generate <i>BadValue</i>   and <i>BadWindow</i>  
errors. <p>
The <i>XUngrabKeyboard</i>   function releases the keyboard and any queued
events if this client has it actively grabbed from either <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>
  or <i>XGrabKey</i>.   <i>XUngrabKeyboard</i>   does not release the keyboard and any
queued events if the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab
time or is later than the current X server time. It also generates <i>FocusIn</i>
  and  <i>FocusOut</i>   events. The X server automatically performs an  <i>UngrabKeyboard</i>
  request if the event window for an active keyboard grab becomes not viewable.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>BadValue</i> </dt>
<dd>  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument,
the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error. </dd>

<dt><i>BadWindow</i> </dt>
<dd>  A
value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window. </dd>
</dl>
