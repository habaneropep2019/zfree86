<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
editres - a dynamic resource editor for X
Toolkit applications 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Syntax</a></h2>
<b>editres</b> [ <i>-toolkitoption</i> ... ] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Options</a></h2>
<i>Editres</i> accepts
all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see <a href='X.7.html'><i>X(7)</i></a>
).  The order
of the command line options is not important. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
Editres is a tool
that allows users and application developers to view the full widget hierarchy
of any X Toolkit application that speaks the Editres protocol.  In addition,
editres will help the user construct resource specifications, allow the
user to apply the resource to the application and view the results dynamically.
 Once the user is happy with a resource specification editres will append
the resource string to the user's X Resources file. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Using Editres</a></h2>
<i>Editres</i>
provides a window consisting of the following four areas: <p>
A set of popup
menus that allow you full access to editres's features. <p>
The panner allows
a more intuitive way to scroll the application tree display. <p>
Displays information
to the user about the action that editres expects  of her. <p>
This area will
be used to display the selected application's widget tree. <p>
To begin an editres
session select the <b>Get Widget Tree</b> menu item from the command menu.  This
will change the pointer cursor to cross hair. You should now select the
application you wish look at by clicking on any of its windows.  If this
application understands the editres protocol then editres will display
the application's widget tree in its tree window.  If the application does
not understand the editres protocol editres will inform you of this fact
in the message area after a few seconds delay. <p>
Once you have a widget tree
you may now select any of the other menu options. The effect of each of
these is described below.   
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Commands</a></h2>
<p>
Allows the user to click on any application
that speaks the editres protocol and receive its widget tree. <p>
Editres only
knows about the widgets that exist at the present time. Many applications
create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Selecting this menu item will cause
editres to ask the application to resend its widget tree, thus updating
its information to the new state of the application. <p>
For example, xman only
creates the widgets for its <i>topbox</i> when it starts up.  None of the widgets
for the manual page window are created until the user actually clicks on
the <i>Manual Page</i> button.  If you retrieved  xman's widget tree before the
the manual page is active, you may wish to refresh the widget tree after
the manual page has been displayed.  This will allow you to also edit the
manual page's resources. <p>
For documenting applications it is often useful
to be able to dump the entire application widget tree to an ASCII file.
 This file can then be included in the manual page.  When this menu item
is selected a popup dialog is activated.  Type the name of the file in this
dialog, and either select <i>okay</i>, or type a carriage-return.  Editres will
now dump the widget tree to this file.  To cancel the file dialog, select
the <i>cancel</i> button. <p>
This command will popup a resource box for the current
application.  This resource box (described in detail below) will allow the
user to see exactly which resources can be set for the widget that is currently
selected in the widget tree display.  Only one widget may be currently selected;
if greater or fewer are selected editres will refuse to pop up the resource
box and put an error message in the <b>Message Area</b>. <p>
This command will popup
a simple dialog box for setting an arbitrary resource on all selected widgets.
 You must type in the resource name, as well as the value.  You can use
the Tab key to switch between the resource name field the resource value
field. <p>
Exits editres. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Tree Commands</a></h2>
The <b>Tree</b> menu contains several commands
that allow operations to be performed on the widget tree. <p>
This menu item
allows you to select any widget in the application; editres will then highlight
the corresponding element the widget tree display. Once this menu item is
selected the pointer cursor will again turn to a crosshair, and you must
click any pointer button in the widget you wish to have displayed.  Since
some widgets are fully obscured by their children, it is not possible to
get to every widget this way, but this mechanism does give very useful
feedback between the elements in the widget tree and those in the actual
application. <p>
<br>
 <p>
<br>
 <p>
These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or invert all widgets
in the widget tree. <p>
<br>
 <p>
These functions select the immediate parent or children of each of the
currently selected widgets. <p>
<br>
 <p>
These functions select all parents or children of each of the currently
selected widgets.  This is a recursive search. <p>
<br>
 <p>
<br>
 <br>
 <p>
When the tree widget is initially displayed the labels of each widget
in the tree correspond to the widget names.  These functions will cause
the label of <b>all</b> widgets in the tree to be changed to show the class name,
IDs, or window associated with each widget in the application. The widget
IDs, and windows are shown as hex numbers. <p>
In addition there are keyboard
accelerators for each of the  Tree operations.  If the input focus is over
an individual widget in the tree, then that operation will only effect
that widget.  If the input focus is in the Tree background it will have
 exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu item.   <p>
The translation
entries shown may be applied to any widget in the application.  If that
widget is a child of the Tree widget, then it will only affect that widget,
otherwise it will have the same effect as the commands in the tree menu.
<p>
This command is the inverse of the <b>Select Widget in Client</b> command, it
will show the user each widget that is currently selected in the widget
tree, by flashing the corresponding widget in the application <i>numFlashes</i>
(three by default) times in the <i>flashColor</i>. <p>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation Entry</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unselect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(nothing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(widget)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(all)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invert&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(invert)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(children)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Descendants&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(descendants)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Parent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(parent)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Ancestors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select(ancestors)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Widget Names&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relabel(name)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Class Names&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relabel(class)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toggle Widget/Class Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relabel(toggle)
</pre><p>
Clicking button 1 on a widget adds it to the set of selected widgets. Clicking
button 2 on a widget deselects all other widgets and then selects just
that widget. Clicking button 3 on a widget toggles its label between the
widget's instance name the widget's class name. <p>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Using the Resource Box</a></h2>
The
resource box contains five different areas.  Each of the areas, as they
appear on the screen, from top to bottom will be discussed. <p>
This area at
the top of the resource box shows the current resource name exactly as
it would appear if you were to save it to a file or apply it. <p>
This area
allows you to select exactly which widgets this resource will apply to.
 The area contains four lines, the first contains the  name of the selected
widget and all its ancestors, and the more restrictive dot (<b>.</b>) separator.
 The second line contains less specific the Class names  of each widget,
and well as the less restrictive star (<b>*</b>) separator. The third line contains
a set of special buttons called <b>Any Widget</b> which will generalize this level
to match any widget. The last line contains a set of special buttons called
<b>Any Widget Chain</b> which will turn the single level into something that matches
zero or more levels. <p>
The initial state of this area is the most restrictive,
using the resource names and the dot separator.  By selecting the other
buttons in this area you can ease the restrictions to allow more and more
widgets to match the specification.  The extreme case is to select all the
 <b>Any Widget Chain</b> buttons, which will match every widget in the application.
  As you select different buttons the tree display will update to show
you exactly which widgets will be effected by the current resource specification.
<p>
The next area allows you to select the name of the normal or constraint
resources you wish to set.  Some widgets may not have constraint resources,
so that area will not appear. <p>
This next area allows you to enter the resource
value.  This value should be entered exactly as you would type a line into
your resource file. Thus it should contain no unescaped new-lines.  There
are a few special character sequences for this file: <p>
\n - This will be replaced
with a newline. <br>
<p>
\### - Where # is any octal digit.  This will be replaced with a single byte
that contains this sequence interpreted as an octal number. For example,
a value containing a NULL byte can be stored by specifying \000. <br>
<p>
\&lt;new-line&gt; - This will compress to nothing. <br>
<p>
\\ - This will compress to a single backslash. <p>
This area contains several command
buttons, described in this section. <p>
This button allows the user to modify
file that the resources will be saved to.  This button will bring up a dialog
box that will ask you for a filename; once the filename has been entered,
either hit carriage-return or click on the <i>okay</i> button.  To pop down the
dialog box without changing the save file, click the <i>cancel</i> button. <p>
This
button will append the <b>resource line</b> described above to the end of the
current save file.  If no save file has been set the <b>Set Save File</b> dialog
box will be popped up to prompt the user for a filename. <p>
This button attempts
to perform a XtSetValues call on all widgets that match the <b>resource line</b>
described above.  The value specified is applied directly to all matching
widgets.  This behavior is an attempt to give a dynamic feel to the resource
editor.  Since this feature allows users to put an application in states
it may not be willing to handle, a hook has been provided to allow specific
applications to block these SetValues requests (see <b>Blocking Editres Requests</b>
below). <p>
Unfortunately due to design constraints imposed on the widgets by
the X Toolkit and the Resource Manager, trying to coerce an inherently
static system into dynamic behavior can cause strange results.  There is
no guarantee that the results of an apply will be the same as what will
happen when you save the value and restart the application. This functionality
is provided to try to give you a rough feel for what your changes will
accomplish, and the results obtained should be considered suspect at best.
 Having said that, this is one of the neatest features of editres, and
I strongly suggest that you play with it, and see what it can do. <p>
This button
combines the Save and Apply actions described above into one button. <p>
This
button will remove the resource box from the display. 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Blocking Editres Requests</a></h2>
The
editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget set.  This allows
all applications that are linked against Xaw to be able to speak to the
resource editor.  While this provides great flexibility, and is a useful
tool, it can quite easily be abused.  It is therefore possible for any Xaw
application to specify a value for the <b>editresBlock</b> resource described
below, to keep editres from divulging information about its internals,
or to disable the <b>SetValues</b> part of the protocol. 
<dl>

<dt><b>editresBlock (Class<b> EditresBlock)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to impose on the
editres protocol.   </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The accepted values are: </dl>
<p>
Block all requests. </dl>
<p>
Block all
SetValues requests.  As this is the only editres request that actually modifies
the application, this is in effect stating that the application is read-only.
</dl>
<p>
Allow all editres requests. <p>
Remember that these resources are set on any
Xaw application, <b>not editres</b>.  They allow individual applications to keep
all or some of the requests editres makes from ever succeeding.  Of course,
editres is also an Xaw application, so it may also be viewed and modified
by editres (rather recursive, I know), these commands can be blocked by
setting the <b>editresBlock</b> resource on editres itself. 
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Resources</a></h2>
For <i>editres</i>
the available application resources are: 
<dl>

<dt><b>numFlashes (Class<b> NumFlashes)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of times the widgets in the application will be flashed
when the <b>Show Active Widgets</b> command in invoked. </dd>

<dt><b>flashTime (Class<b> FlashTime)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Amount of time between the flashes described above. </dd>

<dt><b>flashColor (Class<b> flashColor)</b>
</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the color used to flash application widgets.  A bright color should
be used that will immediately draw your attention to the area being flashed,
such as red or yellow. </dd>

<dt><b>saveResourcesFile (Class<b> SaveResourcesFile)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This
is the file the resource line will be append to when the <b>Save</b> button activated
in the resource box. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Widgets</a></h2>
In order to specify resources, it is useful
to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose <i>editres</i>.  In the notation
below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name. <p>
