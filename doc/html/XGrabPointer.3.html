<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XGrabPointer</i>   function actively grabs
control of the pointer and returns <i>GrabSuccess</i>   if the grab was successful.
Further pointer events are reported only to the grabbing client. <i>XGrabPointer</i>
  overrides any active pointer grab by this client. If owner_events is 
<i>False</i>,   all generated pointer events are reported with respect to grab_window
and are reported only if selected by event_mask. If owner_events is  <i>True</i>
  and if a generated pointer event would normally be reported to this client,
 it is reported as usual.  Otherwise, the event is reported with respect
to the grab_window and is reported only if selected by event_mask. For either
value of owner_events, unreported events are discarded. <p>
If the pointer_mode
is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   pointer event processing continues as usual. If the
pointer is currently frozen by this client,  the processing of events for
the pointer is resumed. If the pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,   the state
of the pointer, as seen by client applications, appears to freeze, and
the X server generates no further pointer events until the grabbing client
calls  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   or until the pointer grab is released. Actual pointer
changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; they are simply queued
in the server for later processing. <p>
If the keyboard_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,
  keyboard event processing is unaffected by activation of the grab. If
the keyboard_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,   the state of the keyboard, as seen
by client applications, appears to freeze, and the X server generates no
further keyboard events until the grabbing client calls  <i>XAllowEvents</i> 
 or until the pointer grab is released. Actual keyboard changes are not
lost while the pointer is frozen; they are simply queued in the server
for later processing. <p>
If a cursor is specified, it is displayed regardless
of what window the pointer is in.   If  <i>None</i>   is specified, the normal
cursor for that window is displayed when the pointer is in grab_window
or one of its subwindows; otherwise, the cursor for grab_window is displayed.
<p>
If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer is restricted to stay
contained in that window. The confine_to window need have no relationship
to the grab_window. If the pointer is not initially in the confine_to window,
 it is warped automatically to the closest edge  just before the grab activates
and enter/leave events are generated as usual.  If the confine_to window
is subsequently reconfigured,  the pointer is warped automatically, as
necessary,  to keep it contained in the window. <p>
The time argument allows
you to avoid certain circumstances that come up if applications take a
long time to respond or if there are long network delays. Consider a situation
where you have two applications, both of which normally grab the pointer
when clicked on. If both applications specify the timestamp from the event,
 the second application may wake up faster and successfully grab the pointer
before the first application.  The first application then will get an indication
that the other application  grabbed the pointer before its request was
processed. <p>
<i>XGrabPointer</i>   generates <i>EnterNotify</i>   and <i>LeaveNotify</i>   events.
<p>
Either if grab_window or confine_to window is not viewable or if the confine_to
window lies completely outside the boundaries of the root window, <i>XGrabPointer</i>
  fails and returns <i>GrabNotViewable</i>.   If the pointer is actively grabbed
by some other client, it fails and returns <i>AlreadyGrabbed</i>.   If the pointer
is frozen by an active grab of another client, it fails and returns <i>GrabFrozen</i>.
  If the specified time is earlier than the last-pointer-grab time or later
 than the current X server time, it fails and returns <i>GrabInvalidTime</i>. 
 Otherwise, the last-pointer-grab time is set to the specified time (<i>CurrentTime</i>
  is replaced by the current X server time). <p>
<i>XGrabPointer</i>   can generate
<i>BadCursor</i>,   <i>BadValue</i>,   and <i>BadWindow</i>   errors. <p>
The <i>XUngrabPointer</i>   function
releases the pointer and any queued events if this client has actively
grabbed the pointer from <i>XGrabPointer</i>,   <i>XGrabButton</i>,   or from a normal
button press. <i>XUngrabPointer</i>   does not release the pointer if the specified
time is earlier than the last-pointer-grab time or is later than the current
X server time. It also generates  <i>EnterNotify</i>   and  <i>LeaveNotify</i>   events.
The X server performs an  <i>UngrabPointer</i>   request automatically if the
event window or confine_to window  for an active pointer grab becomes not
viewable or if window reconfiguration causes the confine_to window to lie
completely outside the boundaries of the root window. <p>
The <i>XChangeActivePointerGrab</i>
  function changes the specified dynamic parameters if the pointer is actively
grabbed by the client and if the specified time is no earlier than the
last-pointer-grab time and no later than the current X server time. This function
has no effect on the passive parameters of a <i>XGrabButton</i>.   The interpretation
of event_mask and cursor is the same as described in <i>XGrabPointer</i>.   <p>
<i>XChangeActivePointerGrab</i>
  can generate a <i>BadCursor</i>   and <i>BadValue</i>   error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>BadCursor</i>
</dt>
<dd>  A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor. </dd>

<dt><i>BadValue</i>
</dt>
<dd>  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full
range defined by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as
a set of alternatives can generate this error. </dd>

<dt><i>BadWindow</i> </dt>
<dd>  A value for a
Window argument does not name a defined Window. </dd>
</dl>
