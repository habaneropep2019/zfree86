Many thanks go to Ralph Swick (Project Athena / Digital) who
has contributed much time and effort to this widget set.
Previous versions of the widget set are largely due to his
time and effort.  Many of the improvements that I have been
able to make are because he provided a solid foundation to
build upon.  While much of the effort has been Ralph's, many
other people have contributed to the code.

	     1mAthena Widgets and The Intrinsics0m



The X Toolkit is made up of two distinct pieces, the Xt
Intrinsics and a widget set.  The Athena widget set is a
sample implementation of a widget set built upon the Intrin-
sics.  In the X Toolkit, a widget is the combination of an X
window or subwindow and its associated input and output
semantics.

Because the Intrinsics provide the same basic functionality
to all widget sets it may be possible to use widgets from
the Athena widget set with other widget sets based upon the
Intrinsics.  Since widget sets may also implement private
protocols, all functionality may not be available when mix-
ing and matching widget sets.  For information about the
Intrinsics, see the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage0m
4mInterface24m.

The Athena widget set is a library package layered on top of
the Intrinsics and Xlib that provides a set of user inter-
face tools sufficient to build a wide variety of applica-
tions.	This layer extends the basic abstractions provided
by X and provides the next layer of functionality primarily
by supplying a cohesive set of sample widgets.	Although the
Intrinsics are a Consortium standard, there is no standard
widget set.

To the extent possible, the Intrinsics are "policy-free".
The application environment and widget set, not the Intrin-
sics, define, implement, and enforce:

    Policy

    Consistency

    Style

Each individual widget implementation defines its own pol-
icy.  The X Toolkit design allows for, but does not neces-
sarily encourage, the free mixing of radically differing
widget implementations.

1m1.1.	Introduction to the X Toolkit0m

The X Toolkit provides tools that simplify the design of
application user interfaces in the X Window System program-
ming environment.  It assists application programmers by
providing a set of common underlying user-interface



			      1m10m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


functions.  It also lets widget programmers modify existing
widgets, by subclassing, or add new widgets.  By using the X
Toolkit in their applications, programmers can present a
similar user interface across applications to all worksta-
tion users.

The X Toolkit consists of:

    A set of Intrinsics functions for building widgets

    An architectural model for constructing widgets

    A widget set for application programming

While the majority of the Intrinsics functions are intended
for the widget programmer, a subset of the Intrinsics func-
tions are to be used by application programmers (see  4mX0m
4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m).  The architec-
tural model lets the widget programmer design new widgets by
using the Intrinsics and by combining other widgets.  The
application interface layers built on top of the X Toolkit
include a coordinated set of widgets and composition poli-
cies.  Some of these widgets and policies are specific to a
single application domain, and others are common to a vari-
ety of applications.

The remainder of this chapter discusses the X Toolkit and
Athena widget set:

1m1.2.	Terminology0m


In addition to the terms already defined for X programming
(see 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m), the following terms
are specific to the Intrinsics and Athena widget set and
used throughout this document.

1mApplication programmer0m

     A programmer who uses the X Toolkit to produce an
     application user interface.

1mChild0m

     A widget that is contained within another "parent" wid-
     get.



			      1m20m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1mClass0m

     The general group to which a specific object belongs.

1mClient0m

     A function that uses a widget in an application or for
     composing other widgets.

1mFullName0m

     The name of a widget instance appended to the full name
     of its parent.

1mInstance0m

     A specific widget object as opposed to a general widget
     class.

1mMethod0m

     A function or procedure implemented by a widget class.

1mName0m

     The name that is specific to an instance of a widget
     for a given client.  This name is specified at creation
     time and cannot be modified.

1mObject0m

     A data abstraction consisting of private data and pri-
     vate and public functions that operate on the private
     data.  Users of the abstraction can interact with the
     object only through calls to the object's public func-
     tions.  In the X Toolkit, some of the object's public
     functions are called directly by the application, while
     others are called indirectly when the application calls
     the common Intrinsics functions.  In general, if a
     function is common to all widgets, an application uses
     a single Intrinsics function to invoke the function for
     all types of widgets.  If a function is unique to a
     single widget type, the widget exports the function.

1mParent0m

     A widget that contains at least one other ("child")
     widget.  A parent widget is also known as a composite
     widget.

1mResource0m

     A named piece of data in a widget that can be set by a
     client, by an application, or by user defaults.



			      1m30m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1mSuperclass0m

     A larger class of which a specific class is a member.
     All members of a class are also members of the super-
     class.

1mUser0m

     A person interacting with a workstation.

1mWidget0m

     An object providing a user-interface abstraction (for
     example, a Scrollbar widget).

1mWidget class0m

     The general group to which a specific widget belongs,
     otherwise known as the type of the widget.

1mWidget programmer0m

     A programmer who adds new widgets to the X Toolkit.

1m1.3.	Underlying Model0m

The underlying architectural model is based on the following
premises:

Widgets are X windows

     Every user-interface widget is associated with an X
     window.  The X window ID for a widget is readily avail-
     able from the widget.  Standard Xlib calls can be used
     by widgets for many of their input and output opera-
     tions.

Information hiding

     The data for every widget is private to the widget and
     its subclasses.  That is, the data is neither directly
     accessible nor visible outside of the module implement-
     ing the widget.  All program interaction with the wid-
     get is performed by a set of operations (methods) that
     are defined for the widget.












			      1m40m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


Widget semantics and widget layout geometry

     Widget semantics are clearly separated from widget lay-
     out geometry.  Widgets are concerned with implementing
     specific user-interface semantics.	 They have little
     control over issues such as their size or placement
     relative to other widget peers.  Mechanisms are pro-
     vided for associating geometric managers with widgets
     and for widgets to make suggestions about their own
     geometry.

1m1.4.	Conventions Used in this Manual0m

    All resources available to the widgets are listed with
     each widget.  Many of these are available to more than
     one widget class due to the object oriented nature of
     the Intrinsics.  The new resources for each widget are
     listed in bold text, and the inherited resources are
     listed in plain text.

    Global symbols are printed in 1mbold 22mand can be function
     names, symbols defined in include files, or structure
     names.  Arguments are printed in 4mitalics24m.

    Each function is introduced by a general discussion
     that distinguishes it from other functions.  The func-
     tion declaration itself follows, and each argument is
     specifically explained.  General discussion of the
     function, if any is required, follows the arguments.
     Where applicable, the last paragraph of the explanation
     lists the return values of the function.

    To eliminate any ambiguity between those arguments that
     you pass and those that a function returns to you, the
     explanations for all arguments that you pass start with
     the word 4mspecifies24m or, in the case of multiple argu-
     ments, the word 4mspecify24m. The explanations for all argu-
     ments that are returned to you start with the word
     4mreturns24m or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word
     4mreturn24m.  The explanations for all arguments that you
     can pass and are returned start with the words 4mspeci-0m
     4mfies24m 4mand24m 4mreturns24m.

    Any pointer to a structure that is used to return a
     value is designated as such by the 4m_return24m suffix as
     part of its name.	All other pointers passed to these
     functions are used for reading only.  A few arguments
     use pointers to structures that are used for both input
     and output and are indicated by using the 4m_in_out24m suf-
     fix.

1m1.5.	Format of the Widget Reference Chapters0m

The majority of this document is a reference guide for the
Athena widget set.  Chapters three through six give the pro-
grammer all information necessary to use the widgets.  The
layout of the chapters follows a specific pattern to allow
the programmer to easily find the desired information.

The first few pages of every chapter give an overview of the
widgets in that section.  Widgets are grouped into chapters
by functionality.

Chapter 3
       Simple Widgets

Chapter 4
       Menus

Chapter 5
       Text Widgets

Chapter 6
       Composite and Constraint Widget

Following the introduction will be a description of each
widget in that chapter.	 When no functional grouping is
obvious the widgets are listed in alphabetical order, such
as in chapters three and six.

The first section of each widget's description is a table
that contains general information about this widget class.
Here is the table for the Box widget, and an explanation of
all the entries.


Application Header file<X11/Xaw/Box.h>
Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/BoxP.h>
Class		    boxWidgetClass
Class Name	    Box
Superclass	    Composite



1mApplication Header File0m
		    This file must be included when an
		    application uses this widget.  It usu-
		    ally contains the class definition, and
		    some resource macros.  This is often
		    called the ``public'' header file.

1mClass Header File   22mThis file will only be used by widget
		    programmers.  It will need to be
		    included by any widget that subclasses
		    this widget.  This is often called the



			      1m60m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    ``private'' header file.

1mClass		      22mThis is the widget class of this widget.
		    This global symbol is passed to 1mXtCre-0m
		    1mateWidget 22mso that the Intrinsics will
		    know which type of widget to create.

1mClass Name	      22mThis is the resource name of this class.
		    This name can be used in a resource file
		    to match any widget of this class.

1mSuperclass	      22mThis is the superclass that this widget
		    class is descended from.  If you under-
		    stand how the superclass works it will
		    allow you to more quickly understand
		    what this widget does, since much of its
		    functionality may be inherited from its
		    superclass.


After this table follows a general description of the
default behavior of this widget, as seen by the user.  In
many cases this functionality may be overridden by the
application programmer, or by the user.

The next section is a table showing the name, class, type
and default value of each resource that is available to this
widget.	 There is also a column containing notes describing
special restrictions placed upon individual resources.

A    This resource may be automatically adjusted when
     another resource is changed.

C    This resource is only settable at widget creation time,
     and may not be modified with 1mXtSetValues22m.

D    Do not modify this resource.  While setting this
     resource will work, it can cause unexpected behavior.
     When this symbol appears there is another, preferred,
     interface provided by the X Toolkit.

R    This resource is READ-ONLY, and may not be modified.

After the resource table is a detailed description of every
resource available to that widget.  Many of these are redun-
dant, but printing them with each widget saves page flip-
ping.  The names of the resources that are inherited are
printed in plain text, while the names of the resources that
are new to this class are printed in 1mbold22m.	 If you have
already read the description of the superclass you need only
pay attention to the resources printed in bold.

For each composite widget there is a section on layout
semantics that follows the resource description.  This



			      1m70m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


section will describe the effect of constraint resources on
the layout of the children, as well as a general description
of where it prefers to place its children.

Descriptions of default translations and action routines
come next, for widgets to which they apply.  The last item
in each widget's documentation is the description of all
convenience routines provided by the widget.

1m1.6.	Input Focus0m

The Intrinsics define a resource on all Shell widgets that
interact with the window manager called 1minput22m.  This
resource requests the assistance of window manager in
acquiring the input focus.  The resource defaults to 1mFalse0m
in the Intrinsics, but is redefined to default to 1mTrue 22mwhen
an application is using the Athena widget set.	An applica-
tion programmer may override this default and set the
resource back to 1mFalse 22mif the application does not need the
window manager to give it the input focus.  See the 4mX24m 4mTool-0m
4mkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m for details on the
4minput24m resource.

		       1mUsing Widgets0m



Widgets serve as the primary tools for building a user
interface or application environment.  The Athena widget set
consists of primitive widgets that contain no children (for
example, a command button) and composite widgets which may
contain one or more widget children (for example, a Box wid-
get).

The remaining chapters explain the widgets that are provided
by the Athena widget set.  These user-interface components
serve as an interface for application programmers who do not
want to implement their own widgets.  In addition, they
serve as a starting point for those widget programmers who,
using the Intrinsics mechanisms, want to implement alterna-
tive application programming interfaces.

This chapter is a brief introduction to widget programming.
The examples provided use the Athena widgets, though most of
the concepts will apply to all widget sets.  Although there
are several programming interfaces to the X Toolkit, only
one is described here.	A full description of the program-
ming interface is provided in the document 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrin-0m
4msics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

1m2.1.	Setting the Locale0m

If it is desirable that the application take advantage of
internationalization (i18n), you must establish locale with
4mXtSetLanguageProc24m before 1mXtDisplayInitialize 22mor 1mXtAppIni-0m
1mtialize 22mis called.	 For full details, please refer to the
document 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m, sec-
tion 2.2. However, the following simplest-case call is suf-
ficient in many or most applications.


	  XtSetLanguageProc(NULL, NULL, NULL);


Most notably, this will affect the Standard C locale, deter-
mine which resource files will be loaded, and what fonts
will be required of FontSet specifications.  In many cases,
the addition of this line is the only source change required
to internationalize Xaw programs, and will not disturb the
function of programs in the default "C" locale.

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1m2.2.	Initializing the Toolkit0m

You must call a toolkit initialization function before
invoking any other toolkit routines (besides locale setting,
above).	 4mXtAppInitialize24m opens the X server connection,
parses the command line, and creates an initial widget that
will serve as the root of a tree of widgets created by this
application.

Widget XtAppInitialize(4mapp_context_return24m, 4mapplication_class24m, 4moptions24m, 4mnum_options24m,
		    4margc_in_out24m, 4margv_in_out24m, 4mfallback_resources24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      XtAppContext *4mapp_context_return24m;
      String 4mapplication_class24m;
      XrmOptionDescRec 4moptions24m[];
      Cardinal 4mnum_options24m;
      int *4margc_in_out24m;
      String *4margv_in_out24m[];
      String *4mfallback_resources24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mapp_con_return24m Returns the application context of this
	       application, if non-NULL.

4mapplication_class0m
	       Specifies the class name of this application,
	       which is usually the generic name for all
	       instances of this application.  A useful con-
	       vention is to form the class name by capital-
	       izing the first letter of the application
	       name. For example, the application named
	       ``xman'' has a class name of ``Xman''.

4moptions24m	    Specifies how to parse the command line for
	       any application-specific resources.  The
	       options argument is passed as a parameter to
	       4mXrmParseCommand24m.  For further information,
	       see 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.

4mnum_options24m    Specifies the number of entries in the
	       options list.

4margc_in_out24m    Specifies a pointer to the number of command
	       line parameters.

4margv_in_out24m    Specifies the command line parameters.

4mfallback_resources0m
	       Specifies resource values to be used if the
	       site-wide application class defaults file
	       cannot be opened, or NULL.





			     1m100m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4margs24m	    Specifies the argument list to use when cre-
	       ating the Application shell.

4mnum_args24m	    Specifies the number of arguments in 4margs24m.

This function will remove the command line arguments that
the toolkit reads from 4margc_in_out24m, and 4margv_in_out24m.	It
will then attempt to open the display.	If the display can-
not be opened, an error message is issued and XtAppInitial-
ize terminates the application.	 Once the display is opened,
all resources are read from the locations specified by the
Intrinsics.  This function returns an ApplicationShell wid-
get to be used as the root of the application's widget tree.

1m2.3.	Creating a Widget0m

Creating a widget is a three-step process.  First, the wid-
get instance is allocated, and various instance-specific
attributes are set by using 1mXtCreateWidget22m.  Second, the
widget's parent is informed of the new child by using 1mXtMan-0m
1mageChild22m.	Finally, X windows are created for the parent and
all its children by using 1mXtRealizeWidget 22mand specifying the
top-most widget. The first two steps can be combined by
using 1mXtCreateManagedWidget22m.  In addition, 1mXtRealizeWidget0m
is automatically called when the child becomes managed if
the parent is already realized.

To allocate, initialize, and manage a widget, use 4mXtCreateM-0m
4managedWidget24m.

Widget XtCreateManagedWidget(4mname24m, 4mwidget_class24m, 4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      String 4mname24m;
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;
      Widget 4mparent24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the instance name for the created widget
	  that is used for retrieving widget resources.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class pointer for the created
	  widget.

4mparent24m    Specifies the parent widget ID.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list.  The argument list is
	  a variable-length list composed of name and value
	  pairs that contain information pertaining to the
	  specific widget instance being created.  For fur-
	  ther information, see Section 2.7.2.





			     1m110m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument
	  list.	 If the num_args is zero, the argument list
	  is never referenced.

When a widget instance is successfully created, the widget
identifier is returned to the application.  If an error is
encountered, the 4mXtError24m routine is invoked to inform the

1m2.4.	Common Resources0m

Although a widget can have unique arguments that it under-
stands, all widgets have common arguments that provide some
regularity of operation.  The common arguments allow arbi-
trary widgets to be managed by higher-level components with-
out regard for the individual widget type.  Widgets will
ignore any argument that they do not understand.

The following resources are retrieved from the argument list
or from the resource database by all of the Athena widgets:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName		      Class		  Type		     Default Value0m
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
accelerators	    Accelerators	AcceleratorTable   NULL
ancestorSensitive   AncestorSensitive	Boolean		   True

x		    Position		Position	   0
y		    Position		Position	   0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following additional resources are retrieved from the
argument list or from the resource database by many of the
Athena widgets:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


1m2.5.	Resource Conversions0m

Most resources in the Athena widget set have a converter
registered that will translate the string in a resource file
to the correct internal representation.	 While some are
obvious (string to integer, for example), others need spe-
cific mention of the allowable values.	Three general con-
verters are described here:

    Cursor

    Pixel

    Bitmap

Many widgets have defined special converters that apply only
to that widget.	 When these occur, the documentation section
for that widget will describe the converter.

1m2.5.1.  Cursor Conversion0m

The value for the 1mcursorName 22mresource is specified in the
resource database as a string, and is of the following
forms:

    A standard X cursor name from 1m< X11/cursorfont.h >22m.
     The names in 1mcursorfont.h 22meach describe a specific cur-
     sor.  The resource names for these cursors are exactly
     like the names in this file except the 1mXC_ 22mis not used.
     The cursor definition 1mXC_gumby 22mhas a resource name of
     1mgumby22m.

    Glyphs, as in 4mFONT24m 4mfont-name24m 4mglyph-index24m 4m[[24m 4mfont-name24m 4m]0m
     4mglyph-index24m 4m]24m.  The first font and glyph specify the
     cursor source pixmap.  The second font and glyph spec-
     ify the cursor mask pixmap.  The mask font defaults to
     the source font, and the mask glyph index defaults to
     the source glyph index.

    A relative or absolute file name.	If a relative or
     absolute file name is specified, that file is used to
     create the source pixmap.	Then the string "Mask" is
     appended to locate the cursor mask pixmap.	 If the
     "Mask" file does not exist, the suffix "msk" is tried.



			     1m130m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


     If "msk" fails, no cursor mask will be used.  If the
     filename does not start with '/' or './' the the bitmap
     file path is used (see section 2.4.3).

1m2.5.2.  Pixel Conversion0m

The string-to-pixel converter takes any name that is accept-
able to XParseColor (see 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m).
In addition this routine understands the special toolkit
symbols `XtDefaultForeground' and `XtDefaultBackground',
described in 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.
In short the acceptable pixel names are:

    Any color name for the rgb.txt file (typically in the
     directory /usr/lib/X11 on POSIX systems).

    A numeric specification of the form #<red><green><blue>
     where these numeric values are hexadecimal digits (both
     upper and lower case).

    The special strings `XtDefaultForeground' and `XtDe-
     faultBackground'

1m2.5.3.  Bitmap Conversion0m

The string-to-bitmap converter attempts to locate a file
containing bitmap data whose name is specified by the input
string.	 If the file name is relative (i.e. does not begin
with / or ./), the directories to be searched are specified
in the 1mbitmapFilePath 22mresource--class 1mBitmapFilePath22m.	 This
resource specifies a colon (:) separated list of directories
that will be searched for the named bitmap or cursor glyph
(see section 2.4.1).  The 1mbitmapFilePath 22mresource is global
to the application, and may 1mnot 22mbe specified differently for
each widget that wishes to convert a cursor to bitmap.	In
addition to the directories specified in the 1mbitmapFilePath0m
resource a default directory is searched.  When using POSIX
the default directory is 4m/usr/include/X11/bitmaps24m.

1m2.6.	Realizing a Widget0m

The 4mXtRealizeWidget24m function performs two tasks:

    Calculates the geometry constraints of all managed
     descendants of this widget.  The actual calculation is
     put off until realize time for performance reasons.

    Creates an X window for the widget and, if it is a com-
     posite widget, realizes each of its managed children.

void XtRealizeWidget(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;





			     1m140m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

For further information about this function, see the 4mX24m 4mTool-0m
4mkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

1m2.7.	Processing Events0m

Now that the application has created, managed and realized
its widgets, it is ready to process the events that will be
delivered by the X Server to this client.  A function call
that will process the events is 1mXtAppMainLoop22m.

void XtAppMainLoop(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context of this applica-
	  tion.	 The value is normally returned by 1mXtAppIni-0m
	  1mtialize22m.

This function never returns: it is an infinite loop that
processes the X events.	 User input can be handled through
callback procedures and application defined action routines.
More details are provided in 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLan-0m
4mguage24m 4mInterface24m.

1m2.8.	Standard Widget Manipulation Functions0m

After a widget has been created, a client can interact with
that widget by calling one of the standard widget manipula-
tion routines provided by the Intrinsics, or a widget class-
specific manipulation routine.

The Intrinsics provide generic routines to give the applica-
tion programmer access to a set of standard widget func-
tions.	The common widget routines let an application or
composite widget perform the following operations on widgets
without requiring explicit knowledge of the widget type.

    Control the mapping of widget windows

    Destroy a widget instance

    Obtain an argument value

    Set an argument value

1m2.8.1.  Mapping Widgets0m

By default, widget windows are mapped (made viewable) auto-
matically by 1mXtRealizeWidget22m.  This behavior can be disabled
by using 1mXtSetMappedWhenManaged22m, making the client responsi-
ble for calling 1mXtMapWidget 22mto make the widget viewable.



			     1m150m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void XtSetMappedWhenManaged(4mw24m, 4mmap_when_managed24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Boolean 4mmap_when_managed24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4mmap_when_managed0m
	  Specifies the new value.  If map_when_managed is
	  1mTrue22m, the widget is mapped automatically when it
	  is realized.	If map_when_managed is 1mFalse22m, the
	  client must call 4mXtMapWidget24m or make a second call
	  to 4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m to cause the child win-
	  dow to be mapped.


The definition for 4mXtMapWidget24m is:

void XtMapWidget(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

When you are creating several children in sequence for a
previously realized common parent it is generally more effi-
cient to construct a list of children as they are created
(using 1mXtCreateWidget22m) and then use 1mXtManageChildren 22mto
request that their parent managed them all at once.  By man-
aging a list of children at one time, the parent can avoid
wasteful duplication of geometry processing and the associ-
ated ``screen flash''.

void XtManageChildren(4mchildren24m, 4mnum_children24m)
      WidgetList 4mchildren24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_children24m;


4mchildren24m  Specifies a list of children to add.

4mnum_children0m
	  Specifies the number of children to add.

If the parent is already visible on the screen, it is espe-
cially important to batch updates so that the minimum amount
of visible window reconfiguration is performed.

For further information about these functions, see the 4mX0m
4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

1m2.8.2.  Destroying Widgets0m

To destroy a widget instance of any type, use 4mXtDestroyWid-0m
4mget24m.



			     1m160m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void XtDestroyWidget(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4mXtDestroyWidget24m destroys the widget and recursively destroys
any children that it may have, including the windows created
by its children.  After calling 4mXtDestroyWidget24m, no further
references should be made to the widget or any children that
the destroyed widget may have had.

1m2.8.3.  Retrieving Widget Resource Values0m

To retrieve the current value of a resource attribute asso-
ciated with a widget instance, use 4mXtGetValues24m.

void XtGetValues(4mw24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4margs24m      Specifies a variable-length argument list of name
	  and 1maddress 22mpairs that contain the resource name
	  and the address into which the resource value is
	  stored.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument
	  list.

The arguments and values passed in the argument list are
dependent on the widget. Note that the caller is responsible
for providing space into which the returned resource value
is copied; the 1mArgList 22mcontains a pointer to this storage
(e.g. x and y must be allocated as Position).  For further
information, see the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage0m
4mInterface24m.

1m2.8.4.  Modifying Widget Resource Values0m

To modify the current value of a resource attribute associ-
ated with a widget instance, use 4mXtSetValues24m.

void XtSetValues(4mw24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.




			     1m170m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4margs24m      Specifies an array of name and 1mvalue 22mpairs that
	  contain the arguments to be modified and their new
	  values.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument
	  list.

The arguments and values that are passed will depend on the
widget being modified.	Some widgets may not allow certain
resources to be modified after the widget instance has been
created or realized.  No notification is given if any part
of a 1mXtSetValues 22mrequest is ignored.

For further information about these functions, see the 4mX0m
4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

			    Note

     The argument list entry for 4mXtGetValues24m specifies
     the address to which the caller wants the value
     copied.  The argument list entry for 4mXtSetValues24m,
     however, contains the new value itself, if the
     size of value is less than sizeof(XtArgVal)
     (architecture dependent, but at least
     sizeof(long)); otherwise, it is a pointer to the
     value.  String resources are always passed as
     pointers, regardless of the length of the string.


1m2.9.	Using the Client Callback Interface0m

Widgets can communicate changes in their state to their
clients by means of a callback facility.  The format for a
client's callback handler is:

void 4mCallbackProc24m(4mw24m, 4mclient_data24m, 4mcall_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies widget for which the callback is regis-
	  tered.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies arbitrary client-supplied data that the
	  widget should pass back to the client when the
	  widget executes the client's callback procedure.
	  This is a way for the client registering the call-
	  back to also register client-specific data: a
	  pointer to additional information about the wid-
	  get, a reason for invoking the callback, and so
	  on. If no additional information is necessary,
	  NULL may be passed as this argument.	This field



			     1m180m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	  is also frequently known as the 4mclosure24m.

4mcall_data24m Specifies any callback-specific data the widget
	  wants to pass to the client.	For example, when
	  Scrollbar executes its 1mjumpProc 22mcallback list, it
	  passes the current position of the thumb in
	  4mcall_data24m.

Callbacks can be registered either by creating an argument
containing the callback list described below or by using the
special convenience routines 1mXtAddCallback 22mand 1mXtAddCall-0m
1mbacks22m.  When the widget is created, a pointer to a list of
callback procedure and data pairs can be passed in the argu-
ment list to 4mXtCreateWidget24m.  The list is of type 4mXtCall-0m
4mbackList24m:


typedef struct {
     XtCallbackProc callback;
     XtPointer closure;
} XtCallbackRec, *XtCallbackList;


The callback list must be allocated and initialized before
calling 4mXtCreateWidget24m.  The end of the list is identified
by an entry containing NULL in callback and closure.  Once
the widget is created, the client can change or de-allocate
this list; the widget itself makes no further reference to
it.  The closure field contains the client_data passed to
the callback when the callback list is executed.

The second method for registering callbacks is to use 4mXtAdd-0m
4mCallback24m after the widget has been created.

void XtAddCallback(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name,24m 4mcallback24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtCallbackProc 4mcallback24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget to add the callback to.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list within the widget to
	  append to.

4mcallback24m  Specifies the callback procedure to add.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the data to be passed to the callback
	  when it is invoked.





			     1m190m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mXtAddCallback24m adds the specified callback to the list for
the named widget.

All widgets provide a callback list named 4mdestroyCallback0m
where clients can register procedures that are to be exe-
cuted when the widget is destroyed.  The destroy callbacks
are executed when the widget or an ancestor is destroyed.
The 4mcall_data24m argument is unused for destroy callbacks.

1m2.10.	 Programming Considerations0m

This section provides some guidelines on how to set up an
application program that uses the X Toolkit.

1m2.10.1.  Writing Applications0m

When writing an application that uses the X Toolkit, you
should make sure that your application performs the follow-
ing:

1.   Include <4mX11/Intrinsic.h24m> in your application programs.
     This header file automatically includes <4mX11/Xlib.h24m>,
     so all Xlib functions also are defined.  It may also be
     necessary to include 1m< X11/StringDefs.h > 22mwhen setting
     up argument lists, as many of the XtN4msomething24m defini-
     tions are only defined in this file.

2.   Include the widget-specific header files for each wid-
     get type that you need to use.  For example,
     <4mX11/Xaw/Label.h24m> and <4mX11/Xaw/Command.h24m>.

3.   Call the 4mXtAppInitialize24m function before invoking any
     other toolkit or Xlib functions.  For further informa-
     tion, see Section 2.1 and the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC0m
     4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

4.   To pass attributes to the widget creation routines that
     will override any site or user customizations, set up
     argument lists.  In this document, a list of valid
     argument names is provided in the discussion of each
     widget.  The names each have a global symbol defined
     that begins with 1mXtN 22mto help catch spelling errors.
     For example, 1mXtNlabel 22mis defined for the 1mlabel 22mresource
     of many widgets.

     For further information, see Section 2.9.2.2.

5.   When the argument list is set up, create the widget
     with the 1mXtCreateManagedWidget 22mfunction.  For further
     information, see Section 2.2 and the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrin-0m
     4msics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

6.   If the widget has any callback routines, set by the
     4mXtNcallback24m argument or the 4mXtAddCallback24m function,



			     1m200m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


     declare these routines within the application.

7.   After creating the initial widget hierarchy, windows
     must be created for each widget by calling 4mXtReal-0m
     4mizeWidget24m on the top level widget.

8.   Most applications now sit in a loop processing events
     using 4mXtAppMainLoop24m, for example:


     XtCreateManagedWidget(4mname24m, 4mclass24m, 4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m);
     XtRealizeWidget(4mshell24m);
     XtAppMainLoop(4mapp_context24m);


     For information about this function, see the 4mX24m 4mToolkit0m
     4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

9.   Link your application with 4mlibXaw24m (the Athena widgets),
     4mlibXmu24m (miscellaneous utilities), 4mlibXt24m (the X Toolkit
     Intrinsics), 4mlibSM24m (Session Management), 4mlibICE24m (Inter-
     Client Exchange), 4mlibXext24m (the extension library needed
     for the shape extension code which allows rounded Com-
     mand buttons), and 4mlibX1124m (the core X library).  The
     following provides a sample command line:


     cc -o 4mapplication24m 4mapplication24m.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11


1m2.10.2.  Changing Resource Values0m

The Intrinsics support two methods of changing the default
resource values; the resource manager, and an argument list
passed into XtCreateWidget.  While resources values will get
updated no matter which method you use, the two methods pro-
vide slightly different functionality.

Resource Manager
	       This method picks up resource definitions
	       described in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface0m
	       from many different locations at run time.
	       The locations most important to the applica-
	       tion programmer are the 4mfallback24m 4mresources0m
	       and the 4mapp-defaults24m file, (see 4mX24m 4mToolkit0m
	       4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m for the
	       complete list).	Since these resource are
	       loaded at run time, they can be overridden by
	       the user, allowing an application to be cus-
	       tomized to fit the particular needs of each
	       individual user.	 These values can also be
	       modified without the need to rebuild the
	       application, allowing rapid prototyping of
	       user interfaces.	 Application programmers



			     1m210m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	       should use resources in preference to hard-
	       coded values whenever possible.

Argument Lists The values passed into the widget at creation
	       time via an argument list cannot be modified
	       by the user, and allow no opportunity for
	       customization.  It is used to set resources
	       that cannot be specified as strings (e.g.
	       callback lists) or resources that should not
	       be overridden (e.g. window depth) by the
	       user.

1m2.10.2.1.  Specifying Resources0m

It is important for all X Toolkit application programmers to
understand how to use the X Resource Manager to specify
resources for widgets in an X application.  This section
will describe the most common methods used to specify these
resources, and how to use the X Resource manager.

1mXrdb		 22mThe 1mxrdb 22mutility may be used to load a file
	       containing resources into the X server.
	       Once the resources are loaded, the resources
	       will affect any new applications started on
	       the display that they were loaded onto.

1mApplication Defaults0m
	       The application defaults (app-defaults) file
	       (normally in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/4mclass-0m
	       4mname24m) for an application is loaded whenever
	       the application is started.

The resource specification has two colon-separated parts, a
name, and a value.  The 4mvalue24m is a string whose format is
dependent on the resource specified by 4mname24m.  4mName24m is con-
structed by appending a resource name to a full widget name.

The full widget name is a list of the name of every ancestor
of the desired widget separated by periods (.).	 Each widget
also has a class associated with it.  A class is a type of
widget (e.g. Label or Scrollbar or Box).  Notice that class
names, by convention, begin with capital letters and
instance names begin with lower case letters.  The class of
any widget may be used in place of its name in a resource
specification.	Here are a few examples:

xman.form.button1
	       This is a fully specified resource name, and
	       will affect only widgets called button1 that
	       are children of widgets called form that are
	       children of applications named xman.  (Note
	       that while typically two widgets that are

Xman.Form.Command
	       This will match any Command widget that is a
	       child of a Form widget that is itself a child
	       of an application of class 4mXman24m.

Xman.Form.button1
	       This is a mixed resource name with both wid-
	       get names and classes specified.

This syntax allows an application programmer to specify any
widget in the widget tree.  To match more than one widget
(for example a user may want to make all Command buttons
blue), use an asterisk (*) instead of a period.	 When an
asterisk is used, any number of widgets (including zero) may
exist between the two widget names. For example:

Xman*Command   This matches all Command widgets in the Xman
	       application.

Foo*button1    This matches any widget in the Foo applica-
	       tion that is named 4mbutton124m.

The root of all application widget trees is the widget
returned by 1mXtAppInitialize22m.  Even though this is actually
an ApplicationShell widget, the toolkit replaces its widget
class with the class name of the application.  The name of
this widget is either the name used to invoke the applica-
tion (1margv[0]22m) or the name of the application specified
using the standard 4m-name24m command line option supported by
the Intrinsics.

The last step in constructing the resource name is to append
the name of the resource with either a period or asterisk to
the full or partial widget name already constructed.

*foreground:Blue      Specifies that all widgets in all
		      applications will have a foreground
		      color of blue.

Xman*borderWidth:10   Specifies that all widgets in an
		      application whose class is Xman will
		      have a border width of 10 (pixels).

xman.form.button1.label:Testing
		      Specifies that a particular widget in
		      the xman application will have a label
		      named 4mTesting24m.

An exclamation point (!) in the first column of a line indi-
cates that the rest of the line should be treated as a com-
ment.

The Resource manager is a powerful tool that can be used
very effectively to customize X Toolkit applications at run
time by either the application programmer or the user.	Some
final points to note:

    An application programmer may add new resources to
     their application.	 These resources are associated with
     the global application, and not any particular widget.
     The X Toolkit function used for adding the application
     resources is 1mXtGetApplicationResources22m.

    Be careful when creating resource files.  Since widgets
     will ignore resources that they do not understand, any
     spelling errors will cause a resource to have no
     effect.

    Only one resource line will match any given resource.
     There is a set of precedence rules, which take the fol-
     lowing general stance.

     	  More specific overrides less specific, thus period
     always overrides asterisk.

     	  Names on the left are more specific and override
     names on the right.

     	  When resource specifications are exactly the same,
     user defaults
	  will override program defaults.

For a complete explanation of the rules of precedence, and
other specific topics see 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage0m
4mInterface24m and 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.

1m2.10.2.2.  Creating Argument Lists0m

To set up an argument list for the inline specification of
widget attributes, you may use any of the four approaches
discussed in this section.  Each resource name has a global
symbol associated with it.  This global symbol has the form
XtN4mresource24m 4mname24m.  For example, the symbol for ``fore-
ground'' is 1mXtNforeground22m. For further information, see the
4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

Argument are specified by using the following structure:


typedef struct {
     String name;
     XtArgVal value;
} Arg, *ArgList;






			     1m240m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The first approach is to statically initialize the argument
list.  For example:


static Arg arglist[] = {
     {XtNwidth, (XtArgVal) 400},
     {XtNheight, (XtArgVal) 300},
};


This approach is convenient for lists that do not need to be
computed at runtime and makes adding or deleting new ele-
ments easy.  The 4mXtNumber24m macro is used to compute the num-
ber of elements in the argument list, preventing simple pro-
gramming errors:


     XtCreateWidget(4mname24m, 4mclass24m, 4mparent24m, 4marglist24m, XtNumber(4marglist24m));


The second approach is to use the 4mXtSetArg24m macro.	For exam-
ple:


Arg arglist[10];
XtSetArg(arglist[1], XtNwidth, 400);
XtSetArg(arglist[2], XtNheight, 300);


To make it easier to insert and delete entries, you also can
use a variable index:


Arg arglist[10];
Cardinal i=0;
XtSetArg(arglist[i], XtNwidth,	400);	    i++;
XtSetArg(arglist[i], XtNheight, 300);	    i++;


The i variable can then be used as the argument list count
in the widget create function.	In this example, 4mXtNumber0m
would return 10, not 2, and therefore is not useful.

			    Note

     You should not use auto-increment or auto-decre-
     ment within the first argument to 4mXtSetArg24m.  As it
     is currently implemented, 4mXtSetArg24m is a macro that
     dereferences the first argument twice.


The third approach is to individually set the elements of
the argument list array:




			     1m250m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


Arg arglist[10];
arglist[0].name	 = XtNwidth;
arglist[0].value = (XtArgVal) 400;
arglist[1].name	 = XtNheight;
arglist[1].value = (XtArgVal) 300;


Note that in this example, as in the previous example,
4mXtNumber24m would return 10, not 2, and therefore would not be
useful.

The fourth approach is to use a mixture of the first and
third approaches: you can statically define the argument
list but modify some entries at runtime.  For example:


static Arg arglist[] = {
     {XtNwidth, (XtArgVal) 400},
     {XtNheight, (XtArgVal) NULL},
};
arglist[1].value = (XtArgVal) 300;


In this example, 4mXtNumber24m can be used, as in the first
approach, for easier code maintenance.

1m2.11.	 Example Programs0m

The best way to understand how to use any programming
library is by trying some simple examples.  A collection of
example programs that introduces each of the widgets in that
Athena widget set, as well as many important toolkit pro-
gramming concepts, is available in the X11R6 release as dis-
tributed by the X Consortium.  It can be found in the dis-
tribution directory 1mcontrib/examples/mit/Xaw22m, but see your
site administrator for the exact location of these files on
your system.  See the README file from that directory for a
guide to the examples.

		       1mSimple Widgets0m




Each of these widgets performs a specific user interface
function.  They are 4msimple24m because they cannot have widget
children--they may only be used as leaves of the widget
tree.  These widgets display information or take user input.


1mCommand   22mA push button that, when selected, may cause a
	  specific action to take place.  This widget can
	  display a multi-line string or a bitmap or pixmap
	  image.

1mGrip	    22mA rectangle that, when selected, will cause an
	  action to take place.

1mLabel	    22mA rectangle that can display a multi-line string
	  or a bitmap or pixmap image.

1mList	    22mA list of text strings presented in row column
	  format that may be individually selected.  When an
	  element is selected an action may take place.

1mPanner    22mA rectangular area containing a 4mslider24m that may be
	  moved in two dimensions.  Notification of movement
	  may be continuous or discrete.

1mRepeater  22mA push button that triggers an action at an
	  increasing rate when selected.  This widget can
	  display a multi-line string or a bitmap or pixmap
	  image.

1mScrollbar 22mA rectangular area containing a 4mthumb24m that when
	  slid along one dimension may cause a specific
	  action to take place.	 The Scrollbar may be ori-
	  ented horizontally or vertically.

1mSimple    22mThe base class for most of the simple widgets.
	  Provides a rectangular area with a settable mouse
	  cursor and special border.

1mStripChart0m
	  A real time data graph that will automatically
	  update and scroll.

1mToggle    22mA push button that contains state information.
	  Toggles may also be used as ``radio buttons'' to

	  implement a ``one of many'' or ``zero or one of
	  many'' group of buttons.  This widget can display
	  a multi-line string or a bitmap or pixmap image.

Class		    commandWidgetClass
Class Name	    Command
Superclass	    Label



The Command widget is an area, often rectangular, that con-
tains text or a graphical image. Command widgets are often
referred to as ``push buttons.''  When the pointer is over a
Command widget, the widget becomes highlighted by drawing a
rectangle around its perimeter.	 This highlighting indicates
that the widget is ready for selection.	 When mouse button 1
is pressed, the Command widget indicates that it has been
selected by reversing its foreground and background colors.
When the mouse button is released, the Command widget's
1mnotify 22maction is invoked, calling all functions on its call-
back list.  If the pointer is moved off of the widget before
the pointer button is released, the widget reverts to its
normal foreground and background colors, and releasing the
pointer button has no effect.  This behavior allows the user
to cancel an action.

1m3.1.1.  Resources0m

	       details).

ancestorSensitive
	       The sensitivity state of the ancestors of
	       this widget.  A widget is insensitive if
	       either it or any of its ancestors is insensi-
	       tive.  This resource should not be changed
	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap

	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

bitmap	       A bitmap to display instead of the 1mlabel22m.
	       The default size of the widget will be just
	       large enough to contain the bitmap and the
	       widget's internal width and height.  The
	       resource converter for this resource con-
	       structs bitmaps from the contents of files.
	       (See 1mConverting Bitmaps 22mfor details.)  If
	       this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will
	       be rendered in the foreground color, and the
	       0's in the background color.  If 1mbitmap 22mhas a
	       depth greater than one, it is copied directly
	       into the window.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border
	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

1mcallback	 22mA list of routines to be called when the
	       1mnotify 22maction is invoked.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

1mcornerRoundPercent0m
	       When a 1mShapeStyle 22mof 1mroundedRectangle 22mis
	       used, this resource controls the radius of
	       the rounded corner.  The radius of the
	       rounded corners is specified as a percentage
	       of the length of the shortest side of the
	       widget.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

	       1mcoding8bit 22mor 1mXawTextEncodingChar2b22m.  When
	       1minternational 22mis set to 1mtrue 22mthis resource is
	       not used.

font	       The text font to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mfalse22m.

fontSet	       The text font set to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mtrue22m.

foreground     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       widget's window.	 This color is also used to
	       render all 1's in a 1mbitmap 22mone plane deep.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

1mhighlightThickness0m
	       The thickness of the rectangle that is used
	       to highlight the internal border of this wid-
	       get, alerting the user that it is ready to be
	       selected.  The default value is 2 pixels if
	       the 1mshapeStyle 22mis 1mrectangle22m, and 0 Pixels (no
	       highlighting) otherwise.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

internalHeight
internalWidth  The minimum amount of space to leave between
	       the graphic and the vertical and horizontal
	       edges of the window.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as
	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

justify	       Specifies left, center, or right alignment of
	       graphic within the widget.  This resource may
	       be specified with the values 1mXtJustifyLeft22m,
	       1mXtJustifyCenter22m, or 1mXtJustifyRight22m.  A con-

	       will convert the following strings: 1mleft,0m
	       1mright, 22mand 1mcenter22m.  This resource only has
	       noticeable effect when the width of the wid-
	       get is larger than necessary to display the
	       graphic.	 Note that when the graphic is a
	       multi-line 1mlabel22m, the longest line will obey
	       this justification while shorter lines will
	       be left-justified with the longest one.


label	       Specifies the text string to be displayed in
	       the widget's window if no bitmap is speci-
	       fied.  The default is the name of this wid-
	       get.  Regardless of the value of 1mencoding 22mor
	       1minternational22m, a single newline character (1
	       byte) will cause a line break.

leftBitmap     Specifies a bitmap to display to the left of
	       the graphic in the widget's window.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

	       to resize to its preferred dimensions when-
	       ever its resources are modified with 1mXtSet-0m
	       1mValues22m.  This attempt to resize may be denied
	       by the parent of this widget.  The parent is
	       always free to resize the widget regardless
	       of the state of this resource.

1m3.1.2.  Command Actions0m

The Command widget supports the following actions:

    Switching the button's interior between the foreground
     and background colors with 1mset22m, 1munset22m, and 1mreset22m.

    Processing application callbacks with 1mnotify0m

    Switching the internal border between highlighted and
     unhighlighted states with 1mhighlight 22mand 1munhighlight0m

The following are the default translation bindings used by
the Command widget:


     <EnterWindow>:   highlight()
     <LeaveWindow>:   reset()
     <Btn1Down>:      set()
     <Btn1Up>:	      notify() unset()


The full list of actions supported by Command is:

1mhighlight22m(4mcondition24m)
	       Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that con-
	       trasts with the interior color of the Command
	       widget.	The conditions 1mWhenUnset 22mand 1mAlways0m
	       are understood by this action procedure.	 If

	       no argument is passed, 1mWhenUnset 22mis assumed.

1munhighlight22m()  Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that
	       matches the interior color of the Command
	       widget.

1mset22m()	    Enters the 4mset24m state, in which 1mnotify 22mis pos-
	       sible.  This action causes the button to dis-
	       play its interior in the 1mforeground 22mcolor.
	       The label or bitmap is displayed in the 1mback-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor.

1munset22m()	    Cancels the 4mset24m state and displays the inte-
	       rior of the button in the 1mbackground 22mcolor.
	       The label or bitmap is displayed in the 1mfore-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor.

1mreset22m()	    Cancels any 4mset24m or 4mhighlight24m and displays the
	       interior of the button in the 1mbackground0m
	       color, with the label or bitmap displayed in
	       the 1mforeground 22mcolor.

1mnotify22m()	    When the button is in the 1mset 22mstate this
	       action calls all functions in the callback
	       list named by the 1mcallback 22mresource.  The
	       value of the 4mcall_data24m argument passed to
	       these functions is undefined.

A very common alternative to registering callbacks is to
augment a Command's translations with an action performing
the desired function.  This often takes the form of:


*Myapp*save.translations: #augment <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: Save()



			    Note

     When a bitmap of depth greater that one (1) is
     specified the 4mset24m(), 4munset24m(), and 4mreset24m() actions
     have no effect, since there are no foreground and
     background colors used in a multi-plane pixmap.

The Grip widget provides a small rectangular region in which
user input events (such as ButtonPress or ButtonRelease) may
be handled.  The most common use for the Grip widget is as
an attachment point for visually repositioning an object,
such as the pane border in a Paned widget.

	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

	       to the action routine.  A detailed descrip-
	       tion is given below in the 1mGrip Actions 22msec-
	       tion.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

	       the entire Grip widget.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  While not utilized in
	       this widget, it can and should be checked by
	       any subclasses that have behavior that should
	       vary with locale.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

pointerColorBackground
		 A pixel value which indexes the widget's
		 colormap to derive the background color of
		 the pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursor-0m
		 1mName 22mresource.

	       events to this widget.  The widget will not
	       get input events if either 1mancestorSensitive0m
	       or 1msensitive 22mis 1mFalse22m.

translations   The event bindings associated with this wid-
	       get.

x
y	       The location of the upper left outside corner
	       of this widget in its parent.

1m3.2.2.  Grip Actions0m

The Grip widget does not declare any default event transla-
tion bindings, but it does declare a single action routine
named 1mGripAction22m.	The client specifies an arbitrary event
translation table, optionally giving parameters to the 1mGri-0m
1mpAction 22mroutine.



			     1m370m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The 1mGripAction 22mroutine executes the callbacks on the 1mcall-0m
1mback 22mlist, passing as 4mcall_data24m a pointer to a 1mXawGripCall-0m
1mData 22mstructure, defined in the Grip widget's application
header file.



typedef struct _XawGripCallData {
     XEvent *event;
     String *params;
     Cardinal num_params;
} XawGripCallDataRec, *XawGripCallData,
  GripCallDataRec, *GripCallData; /* supported for R4 compatibility */



In this structure, the 4mevent24m is a pointer to the input event
that triggered the action.  4mparams24m and 4mnum_params24m give the
string parameters specified in the translation table for the
particular event binding.

The following is an example of a translation table that uses
the GripAction:



     <Btn1Down>:	 GripAction(press)
     <Btn1Motion>:	 GripAction(move)
     <Btn1Up>:		 GripAction(release)


For a complete description of the format of translation
tables, see the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInter-0m

A Label widget holds a graphic displayed within a rectangu-
lar region of the screen.  The graphic may be a text string
containing multiple lines of characters in an 8 bit or 16
bit character set (to be displayed with a 4mfont24m), or in a
multi-byte encoding (for use with a 4mfontset24m).  The graphic
may also be a bitmap or pixmap.	 The Label widget will allow
its graphic to be left, right, or center justified.  Nor-
mally, this widget can be neither selected nor directly

	       either it or any of its ancestors is insensi-
	       tive.  This resource should not be changed
	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

1mbitmap	 22mA bitmap to display instead of the 1mlabel22m.
	       The default size of the widget will be just
	       large enough to contain the bitmap and the
	       widget's internal width and height.  The
	       resource converter for this resource con-
	       structs bitmaps from the contents of files.
	       (See 1mConverting Bitmaps 22mfor details.)  If
	       this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will
	       be rendered in the foreground color, and the
	       0's in the background color.  If 1mbitmap 22mhas a
	       depth greater than one, it is copied directly
	       into the window.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border

	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

1mencoding	 22mThe encoding method used by the value of the

	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

1minternalHeight0m
1minternalWidth	 22mThe minimum amount of space to leave between
	       the graphic and the vertical and horizontal
	       edges of the window.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as
	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

	       1mXtJustifyCenter22m, or 1mXtJustifyRight22m.  A con-
	       verter is registered for this resource that
	       will convert the following strings: 1mleft,0m
	       1mright, 22mand 1mcenter22m.  This resource only has
	       noticeable effect when the width of the wid-
	       get is larger than necessary to display the
	       graphic.	 Note that when the graphic is a
	       multi-line 1mlabel22m, the longest line will obey
	       this justification while shorter lines will
	       be left-justified with the longest one.


1mlabel		 22mSpecifies the text string to be displayed in
	       the widget's window if no bitmap is speci-
	       fied.  The default is the name of this wid-
	       get.  Regardless of the value of 1mencoding 22mor
	       1minternational22m, a single newline character (1
	       byte) will cause a line break.

1mleftBitmap	 22mSpecifies a bitmap to display to the left of
	       the graphic in the widget's window.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

pointerColorBackground
		 A pixel value which indexes the widget's
		 colormap to derive the background color of
		 the pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursor-0m
		 1mName 22mresource.

1mresize	 22mSpecifies whether the widget should attempt
	       to resize to its preferred dimensions when-
	       ever its resources are modified with 1mXtSet-0m
	       1mValues22m.  This attempt to resize may be denied
	       by the parent of this widget.  The parent is
	       always free to resize the widget regardless
	       of the state of this resource.

screen	       The screen on which this widget is displayed.
	       This is not a settable resource.

sensitive      Whether or not the toolkit should pass user
	       events to this widget.  The widget will not

	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

1mcallback	 22mAll functions on this list are called when-
	       ever the 1mnotify 22maction is invoked.	The

	       the element selected and is described in
	       detail in the 1mList Callbacks 22msection.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

1mcolumnSpacing0m
1mrowSpacing	 22mThe amount of space, in pixels, between each
	       of the rows and columns in the list.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

1mdefaultColumns 22mThe default number of columns.  This value is
	       used when neither the width nor the height of
	       the List widget is specified or when
	       1mforceColumns 22mis 1mTrue22m.

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when

1mforeground	 22mA pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the color used to paint the
	       text of the list elements.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

internalHeight
internalWidth  The margin, in pixels, between the edges of
	       the list and the corresponding edge of the
	       List widget's window.

1mlist		 22mAn array of text strings displayed in the
	       List widget.  If 1mnumberStrings 22mis zero (the
	       default) then the 1mlist 22mmust be NULL termi-
	       nated.  If a value is not specified for the
	       1mlist22m, then 1mnumberStrings 22mis set to 1, and the
	       name of the widget is used as the 1mlist22m, and
	       1mlongest 22mis set to the length of the name of
	       the widget.  The 1mlist 22mis used in place, and
	       must be available to the List widget for the
	       lifetime of this widget, or until it is
	       changed with 1mXtSetValues 22mor 1mXawListChange22m.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as
	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

1mlongest	 22mSpecifies the width, in pixels, of the long-
	       est string in the current list.	The List
	       widget will compute this value if zero (the
	       default) is specified.  If this resource is
	       set by hand, entries longer than this will be
	       clipped to fit.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

1mnumberStrings	 22mThe number of strings in the current list.
	       If a value of zero (the default) is speci-
	       fied, the List widget will compute it.  When
	       computing the number of strings the List

	       of the currently selected list element will
	       be put into 1mCUT_BUFFER_022m.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

x
y	       The location of the upper left outside corner
	       of this widget in its parent.

1m3.4.2.  List Actions0m

The List widget supports the following actions:

    Highlighting and unhighlighting the list element under
     the pointer with 1mSet 22mand 1mUnset0m

    Processing application callbacks with 1mNotify0m

The following is the default translation table used by the
List Widget:


     <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:  Set() Notify()






			     1m470m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The full list of actions supported by List widget is:

1mSet22m()	    4mSets24m the list element that is currently under
	       the pointer.  To inform the user that this
	       element is currently set, it is drawn with
	       foreground and background colors reversed.
	       If this action is called when there is no
	       list element under the cursor, the currently
	       4mset24m element will be 4munset24m.

1mUnset22m()	    Cancels the 4mset24m state of the element under
	       the pointer, and redraws it with normal fore-
	       ground and background colors.

1mNotify22m()	    Calls all callbacks on the List widget's
	       callback list.  Information about the cur-
	       rently selected list element is passed in the
	       4mcall_data24m argument (see 1mList Callbacks0m
	       below).

1m3.4.3.  List Callbacks0m

All procedures on the List widget's callback list will have
a 1mXawListReturnStruct 22mpassed to them as 4mcall_data24m.  The
structure is defined in the List widget's application header
file.


typedef struct _XawListReturnStruct {
     String string;   /* string shown in the list. */
     int list_index;  /* index of the item selected. */
} XawListReturnStruct;

			    Note

     The 4mlist_index24m item used to be called simply
     4mindex24m.  Unfortunately, this name collided with a
     global name defined on some operating systems, and
     had to be changed.



1m3.4.4.  Changing the List0m

To change the list that is displayed, use 4mXawListChange24m.

void XawListChange(4mw24m, 4mlist24m, 4mnitems24m, 4mlongest24m, 4mresize24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     String * 4mlist24m;
     int 4mnitems24m, 4mlongest24m;
     Boolean 4mresize24m;






			     1m480m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mw24m	       Specifies the List widget.

4mlist24m      Specifies the new list for the List widget to dis-
	  play.

4mnitems24m    Specifies the number of items in the 4mlist24m.	If a
	  value less than 1 is specified, 4mlist24m must be NULL
	  terminated, and the number of items will be calcu-
	  lated by the List widget.

4mlongest24m   Specifies the length of the longest item in the
	  4mlist24m in pixels.	If a value less than 1 is speci-
	  fied, the List widget will calculate the value.

4mresize24m    Specifies a Boolean value that if 1mTrue 22mindicates
	  that the List widget should try to resize itself
	  after making the change.  The constraints of the
	  List widget's parent are always enforced, regard-
	  less of the value specified here.

4mXawListChange24m will 4munset24m all list elements that are cur-
rently 1mset 22mbefore the list is actually changed.  The 4mlist24m is
used in place, and must remain usable for the lifetime of
the List widget, or until 4mlist24m has been changed again with
this function or with 1mXtSetValues22m.

1m3.4.5.  Highlighting an Item0m

To highlight an item in the list, use 4mXawListHighlight24m.

void XawListHighlight(4mw24m, 4mitem24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     int 4mitem24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the List widget.

4mitem24m      Specifies an index into the current list that
	  indicates the item to be highlighted.

Only one item can be highlighted at a time.  If an item is
already highlighted when 4mXawListHighlight24m is called, the
highlighted item is unhighlighted before the new item is
highlighted.

1m3.4.6.  Unhighlighting an Item0m

To unhighlight the currently highlighted item in the list,
use 4mXawListUnhighlight24m.

void XawListUnhighlight(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;





			     1m490m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mw24m	       Specifies the List widget.

1m3.4.7.  Retrieving the Currently Selected Item0m

To retrieve the list element that is currently 4mset24m, use
4mXawListShowCurrent24m.

XawListReturnStruct *XawListShowCurrent(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the List widget.

4mXawListShowCurrent24m returns a pointer to an 4mXawListReturn-0m
4mStruct24m structure, containing the currently highlighted item.
If the value of the index member is XAW_LIST_NONE, the
string member is undefined, and no item is currently
selected.

1m3.4.8.  Restrictions0m

Many programmers create a ``scrolled list'' by putting a
List widget with many entries as a child of a Viewport wid-
get.  The List continues to create a window as big as its
contents, but that big window is only visible where it
intersects the parent Viewport's window.  (I.e., it is
``clipped.'')

While this is a useful technique, there is a serious draw-
back.  X does not support windows above 32,767 pixels in
width or height, but this height limit will be exceeded by a
List's window when the List has many entries (i.e., with a
12 point font, about 3000 entries would be too many.)


1m3.5.	Panner Widget0m



Application header file<X11/Xaw/Panner.h>
Class header file   <X11/Xaw/PannerP.h>
Class		    pannerWidgetClass
Class Name	    Panner
Superclass	    Simple



A Panner widget is a rectangle, called the ``canvas,'' on
which another rectangle, the ``slider,'' moves in two dimen-
sions.	It is often used with a Porthole widget to move, or
``scroll,'' a third widget in two dimensions, in which case
the slider's size and position gives feedback as to what
portion of the third widget is visible.




			     1m500m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The slider may be scrolled around the canvas by pressing,
dragging, and releasing Button1; the default translation
also enables scrolling via arrow keys and some other keys.
While scrolling is in progress, the application receives
notification through callback procedures.  Notification may
be done either continuously whenever the slider moves or
discretely whenever the slider has been given a new loca-
tion.

1m3.5.1.  Resources0m

When creating a Panner widget instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the
resource database:

1mrubberBand	 22mWhether or not scrolling should be discrete
	       (only moving a rubberbanded rectangle until
	       the scrolling is done) or continuous (moving
	       the slider itself).  This controls whether or
	       not the 1mmove 22maction procedure also invokes

1m3.5.2.  Panner Actions0m

The actions supported by the Panner widget are:

1mstart22m()	    This action begins movement of the slider.

1mstop22m()	    This action ends movement of the slider.

1mabort22m()	    This action ends movement of the slider and
	       restores it to the position it held when the
	       1mstart 22maction was invoked.

1mmove22m()	    This action moves the outline of the slider
	       (if the 1mrubberBand 22mresource is True) or the
	       slider itself (by invoking the 1mnotify 22maction
	       procedure).

1mpage22m(4mxamount24m,4myamount24m)
	       This action moves the slider by the specified
	       amounts.	 The format for the amounts is a
	       signed or unsigned floating-point number
	       (e.g., +1.0 or -.5) followed by either 1mp0m
	       indicating pages (slider sizes), or 1mc 22mindi-
	       cating canvas sizes.  Thus, 4mpage(+0,+.5p)0m
	       represents vertical movement down one-half
	       the height of the slider and 4mpage(0,0)24m repre-
	       sents moving to the upper left corner of the
	       canvas.

1mnotify22m()	    This action informs the application of the
	       slider's current position by invoking the
	       1mreportCallback 22mfunctions registered by the
	       application.

1mset22m(4mwhat24m,4mvalue24m)
	       This action changes the behavior of the Pan-
	       ner.  The 4mwhat24m argument must currently be the
	       string 1mrubberband 22mand controls the value of
	       the 1mrubberBand 22mresource.  The 4mvalue24m argument
	       may have one of the values 1mon22m, 1moff22m, or 1mtog-0m
	       1mgle22m.


The default bindings for Panner are:


     <Btn1Down>: start()
     <Btn1Motion>:move()
     <Btn1Up>:	 notify() stop()
     <Btn2Down>: abort()

1m3.5.3.  Panner Callbacks0m

The functions registered on the 1mreportCallback 22mlist are
invoked by the 1mnotify 22maction as follows:

void ReportProc(4mpanner24m, 4mclient_data24m, 4mreport24m)
     Widget 4mpanner24m;
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
     XtPointer 4mreport24m;    /* (XawPannerReport *) */


4mpanner24m    Specifies the Panner widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client data.

4mreport24m    Specifies a pointer to an 1mXawPannerReport 22mstruc-
	  ture containing the location and size of the
	  slider and the size of the canvas.

Class		    repeaterWidgetClass
Class Name	    Repeater
Superclass	    Command



The Repeater widget is a subclass of the Command widget; see
the Command documentation for details.	The difference is
that the Repeater can call its registered callbacks repeat-
edly, at an increasing rate.  The default translation does
so for the duration the user holds down pointer button 1
while the pointer is on the Repeater.

accelerators   A list of event to action bindings to be exe-
	       cuted by this widget, even though the event
	       occurred in another widget.  (See the 4mX24m 4mTool-0m
	       4mkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m for
	       details).

ancestorSensitive
	       The sensitivity state of the ancestors of
	       this widget.  A widget is insensitive if
	       either it or any of its ancestors is insensi-
	       tive.  This resource should not be changed
	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

bitmap	       A bitmap to display instead of the 1mlabel22m.
	       The default size of the widget will be just
	       large enough to contain the bitmap and the
	       widget's internal width and height.  The
	       resource converter for this resource con-
	       structs bitmaps from the contents of files.
	       (See 1mConverting Bitmaps 22mfor details.)  If
	       this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will
	       be rendered in the foreground color, and the
	       0's in the background color.  If 1mbitmap 22mhas a
	       depth greater than one, it is copied directly
	       into the window.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border
	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

callback       A list of routines to be called when the
	       1mnotify 22maction is invoked.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

cornerRoundPercent
	       When a 1mShapeStyle 22mof 1mroundedRectangle 22mis
	       used, this resource controls the radius of
	       the rounded corner.  The radius of the
	       rounded corners is specified as a percentage
	       of the length of the shortest side of the
	       widget.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

1mdecay		 22mThe number of milliseconds that should be

	       while the Repeater button is being held down
	       until the interval has reached 1mminimumDelay0m
	       milliseconds.

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

encoding       The encoding method used by the value of the
	       1mlabel 22mresource.  The value may be 1mXawTextEn-0m
	       1mcoding8bit 22mor 1mXawTextEncodingChar2b22m.  When
	       1minternational 22mis set to 1mtrue 22mthis resource is
	       not used.

1mflash		 22mWhether or not to flash the Repeater button
	       whenever the timer goes off.

font	       The text font to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mfalse22m.

fontSet	       The text font set to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mtrue22m.

foreground     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       widget's window.	 This color is also used to
	       render all 1's in a 1mbitmap 22mone plane deep.

height

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

highlightThickness
	       The thickness of the rectangle that is used
	       to highlight the internal border of this wid-
	       get, alerting the user that it is ready to be
	       selected.  The default value is 2 pixels if
	       the 1mshapeStyle 22mis 1mrectangle22m, and 0 Pixels (no
	       highlighting) otherwise.

1minitialDelay	 22mThe number of milliseconds between the begin-

	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

internalHeight
internalWidth  The minimum amount of space to leave between
	       the graphic and the vertical and horizontal
	       edges of the window.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as
	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

justify	       Specifies left, center, or right alignment of
	       graphic within the widget.  This resource may
	       be specified with the values 1mXtJustifyLeft22m,
	       1mXtJustifyCenter22m, or 1mXtJustifyRight22m.  A con-
	       verter is registered for this resource that
	       will convert the following strings: 1mleft,0m
	       1mright, 22mand 1mcenter22m.  This resource only has
	       noticeable effect when the width of the wid-
	       get is larger than necessary to display the
	       graphic.	 Note that when the graphic is a
	       multi-line 1mlabel22m, the longest line will obey
	       this justification while shorter lines will
	       be left-justified with the longest one.


label	       Specifies the text string to be displayed in
	       the widget's window if no bitmap is speci-
	       fied.  The default is the name of this wid-
	       get.  Regardless of the value of 1mencoding 22mor

leftBitmap     Specifies a bitmap to display to the left of
	       the graphic in the widget's window.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

1mminimumDelay	 22mThe minimum time between callbacks in mil-
	       liseconds.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

pointerColorBackground
		 A pixel value which indexes the widget's
		 colormap to derive the background color of
		 the pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursor-0m
		 1mName 22mresource.

1mrepeatDelay	 22mThe number of milliseconds between each call-
	       back after the first (minus an increasing
	       number of 1mdecay22ms).

resize	       Specifies whether the widget should attempt
	       to resize to its preferred dimensions when-
	       ever its resources are modified with 1mXtSet-0m
	       1mValues22m.  This attempt to resize may be denied
	       by the parent of this widget.  The parent is
	       always free to resize the widget regardless
	       of the state of this resource.

	       This is not a settable resource.

sensitive      Whether or not the toolkit should pass user
	       events to this widget.  The widget will not
	       get input events if either 1mancestorSensitive0m
	       or 1msensitive 22mis 1mFalse22m.

shapeStyle     Nonrectangular widgets may be created using

1m3.6.2.  Repeater Actions0m

The Repeater widget supports the following actions beyond
those of the Command button:

1mstart22m()	    This invokes the functions on the 1mstartCall-0m
	       1mback 22mand 1mcallback 22mlists and sets a timer to
	       go off in 1minitialDelay 22mmilliseconds.  The
	       timer will cause the 1mcallback 22mfunctions to be
	       invoked with increasing frequency until the
	       1mstop 22maction occurs.

1mstop22m()	    This invokes the functions on the 1mstopCall-0m
	       1mback 22mlist and prevents any further timers
	       from occuring until the next 1mstart 22maction.


The following are the default translation bindings used by
the Repeater widget:


     <EnterWindow>:   highlight()
     <LeaveWindow>:   unhighlight()
     <Btn1Down>:      set() start()
     <Btn1Up>:	      stop() unset()

A Scrollbar widget is a rectangle, called the ``canvas,'' on
which another rectangle, the ``thumb,'' moves in one dimen-
sion, either vertically or horizontally.  A Scrollbar can be
used alone, as a value generator, or it can be used within a
composite widget (for example, a Viewport).  When a Scroll-
bar is used to move, or ``scroll,'' the contents of another
widget, the size and the position of the thumb usually give
feedback as to what portion of the other widget's contents
are visible.

Each pointer button invokes a specific action.	Pointer but-
tons 1 and 3 do not move the thumb automatically.  Instead,
they return the pixel position of the cursor on the scroll
region.	 When pointer button 2 is clicked, the thumb moves
to the current pointer position.  When pointer button 2 is
held down and the pointer is moved, the thumb follows the
pointer.

The pointer cursor in the scroll region changes depending on
the current action.  When no pointer button is pressed, the
cursor appears as a double-headed arrow that points in the
direction that scrolling can occur.  When pointer button 1
or 3 is pressed, the cursor appears as a single-headed arrow
that points in the logical direction that the thumb will
move.  When pointer button 2 is pressed, the cursor appears
as an arrow that points to the top or the left of the thumb.

When the user scrolls, the application receives notification
through callback procedures.  For both discrete scrolling
actions, the callback returns the Scrollbar widget, the
client_data, and the pixel position of the pointer when the
button was released.  For continuous scrolling, the callback
routine returns the scroll bar widget, the client data, and
the current relative position of the thumb.  When the thumb
is moved using pointer button 2, the callback procedure is
invoked continuously.  When either button 1 or 3 is pressed,
the callback procedure is invoked only when the button is
released and the client callback procedure is responsible
for moving the thumb.

x
y	       The location of the upper left outside corner
	       of this widget in its parent.

1m3.7.2.  Scrollbar Actions0m

The actions supported by the Scrollbar widget are:

1mStartScroll22m(4mvalue24m)
	       The possible 4mvalues24m are Forward, Backward, or
	       Continuous.  This must be the first action to
	       begin a new movement.

1mNotifyScroll22m(4mvalue24m)
	       The possible 4mvalues24m are Proportional or Full-
	       Length.	If the argument to StartScroll was
	       Forward or Backward, NotifyScroll executes
	       the 1mscrollProc 22mcallbacks and passes either;
	       the position of the pointer, if 4mvalue24m is Pro-
	       portional, or the full length of the scroll
	       bar, if 4mvalue24m is FullLength.  If the argument
	       to StartScroll was Continuous, NotifyScroll
	       returns without executing any callbacks.

1mEndScroll22m()    This must be the last action after a movement
	       is complete.

1mMoveThumb22m()    Repositions the Scrollbar's thumb to the cur-
	       rent pointer location.

1mNotifyThumb22m()
	       Calls the 4mjumpProc24m callbacks and passes the
	       relative position of the pointer as a per-
	       centage of the scroll bar length.


The default bindings for Scrollbar are:


     <Btn1Down>: StartScroll(Forward)
     <Btn2Down>: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb()
     <Btn3Down>: StartScroll(Backward)
     <Btn2Motion>:MoveThumb() NotifyThumb()
     <BtnUp>:	 NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()



Examples of additional bindings a user might wish to specify
in a resource file are:


*Scrollbar.Translations: \
     ~Meta<Key>space: StartScroll(Forward) NotifyScroll(FullLength) \n\
      Meta<Key>space: StartScroll(Backward) NotifyScroll(FullLength) \n\

		      EndScroll()


1m3.7.3.  Scrollbar Callbacks0m

There are two callback lists provided by the Scrollbar wid-
get.  The procedural interface for these functions is
described here.

The calling interface to the 1mscrollProc 22mcallback procedure
is:

void ScrollProc(4mscrollbar24m, 4mclient_data24m, 4mposition24m)
     Widget 4mscrollbar24m;
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
     XtPointer 4mposition24m;	 /* int */


4mscrollbar24m Specifies the Scrollbar widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client data.

4mposition24m  Specifies a pixel position in integer form.

The 1mscrollProc 22mcallback is used for incremental scrolling
and is called by the 1mNotifyScroll 22maction.	The position
argument is a signed quantity and should be cast to an int
when used. Using the default button bindings, button 1
returns a positive value, and button 3 returns a negative
value. In both cases, the magnitude of the value is the dis-
tance of the pointer in pixels from the top (or left) of the
Scrollbar. The value will never be greater than the length
of the Scrollbar.


The calling interface to the 1mjumpProc 22mcallback procedure is:

void JumpProc(4mscrollbar24m, 4mclient_data24m, 4mpercent24m)
     Widget 4mscrollbar24m;
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
     XtPointer 4mpercent_ptr24m;    /* float* */


4mscrollbar24m Specifies the ID of the scroll bar widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client data.

4mpercent_ptr0m
	  Specifies the floating point position of the thumb
	  (0.0 - 1.0).





			     1m690m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The 1mjumpProc 22mcallback is used to implement smooth scrolling
and is called by the 1mNotifyThumb 22maction.  Percent_ptr must
be cast to a pointer to float before use; i.e.


     float percent = *(float*)percent_ptr;


With the default button bindings, button 2 moves the thumb
interactively, and the 1mjumpProc 22mis called on each new posi-
tion of the pointer, while the pointer button remains down.
The value specified by 4mpercent_ptr24m is the current location
of the thumb (from the top or left of the Scrollbar)
expressed as a percentage of the length of the Scrollbar.

1m3.7.4.  Convenience Routines0m

To set the position and length of a Scrollbar thumb, use
4mXawScrollbarSetThumb24m.

void XawScrollbarSetThumb(4mw24m, 4mtop24m, 4mshown24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     float 4mtop24m;
     float 4mshown24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Scrollbar widget.

4mtop24m       Specifies the position of the top of the thumb as
	  a fraction of the length of the Scrollbar.

4mshown24m     Specifies the length of the thumb as a fraction of
	  the total length of the Scrollbar.

4mXawScrollbarThumb24m moves the visible thumb to a new position
(0.0 - 1.0) and length (0.0 - 1.0).  Either the top or shown
arguments can be specified as -1.0, in which case the cur-
rent value is left unchanged.  Values greater than 1.0 are
truncated to 1.0.

If called from 1mjumpProc22m, 1mXawScrollbarSetThumb 22mhas no effect.

1m3.7.5.  Setting Float Resources0m

The 1mshown 22mand 1mtopOfThumb 22mresources are of type 4mfloat24m.  These
resources can be difficult to get into an argument list.
The reason is that C performs an automatic cast of the float
value to an integer value, usually truncating the important
information.  The following code fragment is one portable
method of getting a float into an argument list.


	  top = 0.5;
	  if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) {



			     1m700m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	  /*
	   * If a float is larger than an XtArgVal then pass this
	   * resource value by reference.
	   */
		    XtSetArg(args[0], XtNshown, &top);
	  }
	  else {
	  /*
	   * Convince C not to perform an automatic conversion, which
	   * would truncate 0.5 to 0.
	   */
		    XtArgVal * l_top = (XtArgVal *) &top;
		    XtSetArg(args[0], XtNshown, *l_top);
	  }

The StripChart widget is used to provide a roughly real time
graphical chart of a single value.  For example, it is used
by the common client program 1mxload 22mto provide a graph of
processor load.	 The StripChart reads data from an applica-
tion, and updates the chart at the 1mupdate 22minterval speci-
fied.

	       1 pixel wide line.  Every 1mupdate 22mseconds the
	       1mgetValue 22mprocedure will be used to get a new
	       graph point, and this point will be added to
	       the right end of the StripChart.

1m3.9.2.  Getting the StripChart Value0m

The StripChart widget will call the application routine
passed to it as the 1mgetValue 22mcallback function every 1mupdate0m
seconds to obtain another point for the StripChart graph.




			     1m770m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The calling interface for the 1mgetValue 22mcallback is:

void (*4mgetValueProc24m)(4mw24m, 4mclient_data24m, 4mvalue24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
     XtPointer 4mvalue24m;    /* double * */


4mw24m	       Specifies the StripChart widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client data.

4mvalue24m     Returns a pointer to a double.  The application
	  should set the address pointed to by this argument
	  to a double containing the value to be graphed on
	  the StripChart.

This function is used by the StripChart to call an applica-
tion routine.  The routine will pass the value to be graphed
back to the the StripChart in the 1mvalue 22mfield of this rou-
tine.


1m3.10.	 Toggle Widget0m


Application Header file<Xaw/Toggle.h>
Class Header file   <Xaw/ToggleP.h>
Class		    toggleWidgetClass
Class Name	    Toggle
Superclass	    Command



The Toggle widget is an area, often rectangular, that dis-
plays a graphic.  The graphic may be a text string contain-
ing multiple lines of characters in an 8 bit or 16 bit char-
acter set (to be displayed with a 4mfont24m), or in a multi-byte
encoding (for use with a 4mfontset24m).	 The graphic may also be
a bitmap or pixmap.

This widget maintains a Boolean state (e.g.  True/False or
On/Off) and changes state whenever it is selected.  When the
pointer is on the Toggle widget, the Toggle widget may
become highlighted by drawing a rectangle around its perime-
ter.  This highlighting indicates that the Toggle widget is
ready for selection.  When pointer button 1 is pressed and
released, the Toggle widget indicates that it has changed
state by reversing its foreground and background colors, and
its 1mnotify 22maction is invoked, calling all functions on its
callback list.	If the pointer is moved off of the widget
before the pointer button is released, the Toggle widget
reverts to its previous foreground and background colors,



			     1m780m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


and releasing the pointer button has no effect.	 This behav-
ior allows the user to cancel the operation.

Toggle widgets may also be part of a ``radio group.''  A
radio group is a list of at least two Toggle widgets in
which no more than one Toggle may be set at any time.  A
radio group is identified by the widget ID of any one of its
members.  The convenience routine 1mXawToggleGetCurrent 22mwill
return information about the Toggle widget in the radio
group.

Toggle widget state is preserved across changes in sensitiv-
ity.

	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

bitmap	       A bitmap to display instead of the 1mlabel22m.
	       The default size of the widget will be just
	       large enough to contain the bitmap and the

	       resource converter for this resource con-
	       structs bitmaps from the contents of files.
	       (See 1mConverting Bitmaps 22mfor details.)  If
	       this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will
	       be rendered in the foreground color, and the
	       0's in the background color.  If 1mbitmap 22mhas a
	       depth greater than one, it is copied directly

	       rounded corners is specified as a percentage
	       of the length of the shortest side of the
	       widget.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mtrue22m.

foreground     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       widget's window.	 This color is also used to
	       render all 1's in a 1mbitmap 22mone plane deep.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

highlightThickness

	       the 1mshapeStyle 22mis 1mrectangle22m, and 0 Pixels (no
	       highlighting) otherwise.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

internalHeight
internalWidth  The minimum amount of space to leave between
	       the graphic and the vertical and horizontal
	       edges of the window.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as
	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

justify	       Specifies left, center, or right alignment of
	       graphic within the widget.  This resource may
	       be specified with the values 1mXtJustifyLeft22m,
	       1mXtJustifyCenter22m, or 1mXtJustifyRight22m.  A con-
	       verter is registered for this resource that
	       will convert the following strings: 1mleft,0m
	       1mright, 22mand 1mcenter22m.  This resource only has
	       noticeable effect when the width of the wid-
	       get is larger than necessary to display the
	       graphic.	 Note that when the graphic is a
	       multi-line 1mlabel22m, the longest line will obey
	       this justification while shorter lines will
	       be left-justified with the longest one.

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


label	       Specifies the text string to be displayed in
	       the widget's window if no bitmap is speci-
	       fied.  The default is the name of this wid-
	       get.  Regardless of the value of 1mencoding 22mor
	       1minternational22m, a single newline character (1
	       byte) will cause a line break.

leftBitmap     Specifies a bitmap to display to the left of
	       the graphic in the widget's window.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

pointerColorBackground
		 A pixel value which indexes the widget's
		 colormap to derive the background color of
		 the pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursor-0m
		 1mName 22mresource.

1mradioData	 22mSpecifies the data that will be returned by
	       1mXawToggleGetCurrent 22mwhen this is the cur-
	       rently 4mset24m widget in the radio group.  This
	       value is also used to identify the Toggle
	       that will be set by a call to 1mXawToggle-0m
	       1mSetCurrent22m.	 The value NULL will be returned
	       by 1mXawToggleGetCurrent 22mif no widget in a
	       radio group is currently set.  Programmers
	       must not specify NULL (or Zero) as 1mradioData22m.

1mradioGroup	 22mSpecifies another Toggle widget that is in
	       the radio group to which this Toggle widget
	       should be added.	 A radio group is a group of
	       at least two Toggle widgets, only one of
	       which may be 4mset24m at a time.	 If this value is
	       NULL (the default) then the Toggle will not
	       be part of any radio group and can change
	       state without affecting any other Toggle wid-
	       gets.  If the widget specified in this
	       resource is not already in a radio group then
	       a new radio group will be created containing
	       these two Toggle widgets.  No Toggle widget
	       can be in multiple radio groups.	 The behav-
	       ior of a radio group of one toggle is unde-
	       fined.  A converter is registered which will
	       convert widget names to widgets without
	       caching.

resize	       Specifies whether the widget should attempt
	       to resize to its preferred dimensions when-
	       ever its resources are modified with 1mXtSet-0m
	       1mValues22m.  This attempt to resize may be denied
	       by the parent of this widget.  The parent is
	       always free to resize the widget regardless
	       of the state of this resource.

	       This is not a settable resource.

sensitive      Whether or not the toolkit should pass user
	       events to this widget.  The widget will not
	       get input events if either 1mancestorSensitive0m
	       or 1msensitive 22mis 1mFalse22m.

shapeStyle     Nonrectangular widgets may be created using
	       this resource.  Nonrectangular widgets are
	       supported only on a server that supports the
	       1mShape Extension22m.  If nonrectangular widgets
	       are specified for a server lacking this
	       extension, the shape is ignored and the wid-
	       gets will be rectangular.  The following
	       shapes are currently supported: 1mXmuShapeRect-0m
	       1mangle22m, 1mXmuShapeOval22m, 1mXmuShapeEllipse22m, and
	       1mXmuShapeRoundedRectangle22m.  A converter is
	       registered for this resource that will con-
	       vert the following strings: 1mrectangle, oval,0m
	       1mellipse, 22mand 1mroundedRectangle22m.

1m3.10.2.  Toggle Actions0m

The Toggle widget supports the following actions:

    Switching the Toggle widget between the foreground and
     background colors with 1mset 22mand 1munset 22mand 1mtoggle0m

    Processing application callbacks with 1mnotify0m

    Switching the internal border between highlighted and
     unhighlighted states with 1mhighlight 22mand 1munhighlight0m

The following are the default translation bindings used by
the Toggle widget:



			     1m840m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


     <EnterWindow>:   highlight(Always)
     <LeaveWindow>:   unhighlight()
     <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:toggle() notify()


1m3.10.3.  Toggle Actions0m

The full list of actions supported by Toggle is:

1mhighlight22m(4mcondition24m)
	       Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that con-
	       trasts with the interior color of the Toggle
	       widget.	The conditions 1mWhenUnset 22mand 1mAlways0m
	       are understood by this action procedure.	 If
	       no argument is passed then 1mWhenUnset 22mis
	       assumed.

1munhighlight22m()  Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that
	       matches the interior color of the Toggle wid-
	       get.

1mset22m()	    Enters the 4mset24m state, in which 1mnotify 22mis pos-
	       sible.  This action causes the Toggle widget
	       to display its interior in the 1mforeground0m
	       color.  The label or bitmap is displayed in
	       the 1mbackground 22mcolor.

1munset22m()	    Cancels the 4mset24m state and displays the inte-
	       rior of the Toggle widget in the 1mbackground0m
	       color.  The label or bitmap is displayed in
	       the 1mforeground 22mcolor.

1mtoggle22m()	    Changes the current state of the Toggle wid-
	       get, causing to be set if it was previously
	       unset, and unset if it was previously set.
	       If the widget is to be set, and is in a radio
	       group then this procedure may unset another
	       Toggle widget causing all routines on its
	       callback list to be invoked.  The callback
	       routines for the Toggle that is to be unset
	       will be called before the one that is to be
	       set.

1mreset22m()	    Cancels any 1mset 22mor 1mhighlight 22mand displays the
	       interior of the Toggle widget in the 1mback-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor, with the label displayed in the
	       1mforeground 22mcolor.

1mnotify22m()	    When the Toggle widget is in the 1mset 22mstate
	       this action calls all functions in the call-
	       back list named by the 1mcallback 22mresource.
	       The value of the call_data argument in these



			     1m850m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	       callback functions is undefined.


			    Note

     When a bitmap of depth greater that one (1) is
     specified the 4mset24m(), 4munset24m(), and 4mreset24m() actions
     have no effect, since there are no foreground and
     background colors used in a multi-plane pixmap.


1m3.10.4.  Radio Groups0m

There are typically two types of radio groups desired by
applications.  The default translations for the Toggle wid-
get implement a "zero or one of many" radio group.  This
means that there may be no more than one Toggle widget
active, but there need not be any Toggle widgets active.

The other type of radio group is "one of many" and has the
more strict policy that there will always be exactly one
radio button active.  Toggle widgets can be used to provide
this interface with a slight modification to the translation
table of each Toggle in the group.


     <EnterWindow>:   highlight(Always)
     <LeaveWindow>:   unhighlight()
     <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:set() notify()


This translation table will not allow any Toggle to be 4munset0m
except as a result of another Toggle becoming 4mset24m.	 It is
the application programmer's responsibility to choose an
initial state for the radio group by setting the 1mstate0m
resource of one of its member widgets to 1mTrue22m.

1m3.10.5.  Convenience Routines0m

The following functions allow easy access to the Toggle wid-
get's radio group functionality.

1m3.10.5.1.  Changing the Toggle's Radio Group.0m

To enable an application to change the Toggle's radio group,
add the Toggle to a radio group, or remove the Toggle from a
radio group, use 1mXawToggleChangeRadioGroup22m.

void XawToggleChangeRadioGroup(4mw24m, 4mradio_group24m)
     Widget 4mw24m, 4mradio_group24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Toggle widget.




			     1m860m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mradio_group0m
	  Specifies any Toggle in the new radio group.	If
	  NULL then the Toggle will be removed from any
	  radio group of which it is a member.

If a Toggle is already 4mset24m in the new radio group, and the
Toggle to be added is also 4mset24m then the previously 4mset24m Tog-
gle in the radio group is 4munset24m and its callback procedures
are invoked.

1mFinding the Currently selected Toggle in a radio group of0m
1mToggles0m

To find the currently selected Toggle in a radio group of
Toggle widgets use 1mXawToggleGetCurrent22m.

XtPointer XawToggleGetCurrent(4mradio_group24m);
     Widget 4mradio_group24m;


4mradio_group0m
	  Specifies any Toggle widget in the radio group.

The value returned by this function is the 4mradioData24m of the
Toggle in this radio group that is currently set.  The
default value for 4mradioData24m is the name of that Toggle wid-
get.  If no Toggle is set in the radio group specified then
NULL is returned.

1mChanging the Toggle that is set in a radio group.0m

To change the Toggle that is currently set in a radio group
use 1mXawToggleSetCurrent22m.

void XawToggleSetCurrent(4mradio_group24m, 4mradio_data24m);
     Widget 4mradio_group24m;
     XtPointer 4mradio_data24m;


4mradio_group0m
	  Specifies any Toggle widget in the radio group.

4mradio_data0m
	  Specifies the 4mradioData24m identifying the Toggle
	  that should be set in the radio group specified by
	  the 4mradio_group24m argument.

1mXawToggleSetCurrent 22mlocates the Toggle widget to be set by
matching 4mradio_data24m against the 1mradioData 22mfor each Toggle in
the radio group.  If none match, 1mXawToggleSetCurrent 22mreturns
without making any changes.  If more than one Toggle
matches, 1mXawToggleSetCurrent 22mwill choose a Toggle to set
arbitrarily.  If this causes any Toggle widgets to change
state, all routines in their callback lists will be invoked.



			     1m870m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The callback routines for a Toggle that is to be unset will
be called before the one that is to be set.

1mUnsetting all Toggles in a radio group.0m

To unset all Toggle widgets in a radio group use 1mXawToggle-0m
1mUnsetCurrent22m.

void XawToggleUnsetCurrent(4mradio_group24m);
     Widget 4mradio_group24m;


4mradio_group0m
	  Specifies any Toggle widget in the radio group.

If this causes a Toggle widget to change state, all routines
on its callback list will be invoked.

			 1mChapter 40m

			   1mMenus0m




The Athena widget set provides support for single paned non-
hierarchical popup and pulldown menus.	Since menus are such
a common user interface tool, support for them must be pro-
vided in even the most basic widget sets.  In menuing as in
other areas, the Athena Widget Set provides only basic func-
tionality.

Menus in the Athena widget set are implemented as a menu
container (the SimpleMenu widget) and a collection of
objects that comprise the menu entries.	 The SimpleMenu wid-
get is itself a direct subclass of the OverrideShell widget
class, so no other shell is necessary when creating a menu.
The managed children of a SimpleMenu must be subclasses of
the Sme (Simple Menu Entry) object.

The Athena widget set provides three classes of Sme objects
that may be used to build menus.


1mSme	    22mThe base class of all menu entries.  It may be
	  used as a menu entry itself to provide blank space
	  in a menu.  ``Sme'' means ``Simple Menu Entry.''

1mSmeBSB    22mThis menu entry provides a selectable entry con-
	  taining a text string.  A bitmap may also be
	  placed in the left and right margins.	 ``BSB''
	  means ``Bitmap String Bitmap.''

1mSmeLine   22mThis menu entry provides an unselectable entry
	  containing a separator line.


The SimpleMenu widget informs the window manager that it
should ignore its window by setting the 1mOverride Redirect0m
flag.  This is the correct behavior for the press-drag-
release style of menu operation.  If click-move-click or
``pinable''' menus are desired it is the responsibility of
the application programmer, using the SimpleMenu resources,
to inform the window manager of the menu.

To allow easy creation of pulldown menus, a MenuButton wid-
get is also provided as part of the Athena widget set.

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1m4.1.	Using the Menus0m

The default configuration for the menus is press-drag-
release.  The menus will typically be activated by clicking
a pointer button while the pointer is over a MenuButton,
causing the menu to appear in a fixed location relative to
that button; this is a 1mpulldown 22mmenu.  Menus may also be
activated when a specific pointer and/or key sequence is
used anywhere in the application; this is a 1mpopup 22mmenu (e.g.
clicking Ctrl-<pointer button 1> in the common application
1mxterm22m).  In this case the menu should be positioned under
the cursor. Typically menus will be placed so the pointer
cursor is on the first menu entry, or the last entry
selected by the user.

The menu remains on the screen as long as the pointer button
is held down.  Moving the pointer will highlight different
menu items.  If the pointer leaves the menu, or moves over
an entry that cannot be selected then no menu entry will
highlighted.  When the desired menu entry has been high-
lighted, releasing the pointer button removes the menu, and
causes any mechanism associated with this entry to be
invoked.

1m4.2.	SimpleMenu Widget0m


Application Header file<X11/Xaw/SimpleMenu.h>
Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/SimpleMenP.h>
Class		    simpleMenuWidgetClass
Class Name	    SimpleMenu
Superclass	    OverrideShell



The SimpleMenu widget is a container for the menu entries.
It is a direct subclass of shell, and is should be created
with 1mXtCreatePopupShell22m, not 1mXtCreateManagedWidget22m.  This is
the only part of the menu that actually is associated with a
window.	 The SimpleMenu serves as the glue to bind the indi-
vidual menu entries together into a menu.

1m4.2.1.  Resources0m


The resources associated with the SimpleMenu widget control
aspects that will affect the entire menu.

1mbackingStore	 22mDetermines what type of backing store will be
	       used for the menu.  Legal values for this
	       resource are 1mNotUseful22m, 1mWhenMapped22m, and
	       1mAlways22m.  These values are the backing-store
	       integers defined in <X11/X.h>.  A converter
	       is registered for this resource that will
	       convert the following strings: 1mnotUseful,0m
	       1mwhenMapped, always, 22mand 1mdefault22m.  If 1mdefault0m
	       is specified (the default behavior) the
	       server will use whatever it thinks is appro-
	       priate.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border
	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

1mbottomMargin0m
1mtopMargin	 22mThe amount of space between the top or bottom

1mlabel		 22mThis label will be placed at the top of the
	       SimpleMenu, and may not be highlighted.	The
	       name of the label object is 1mmenuLabel22m.  Using
	       this name it is possible to modify the
	       label's attributes through the resource data-
	       base.  When the label is created, the 1mlabel0m
	       is hard coded to the value of 1mlabel22m, and 1mjus-0m
	       1mtify 22mis hard coded as 1mXtJustifyCenter22m.

1mlabelClass	 22mSpecifies the type of Sme object created as
	       the menu label.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

1mmenuOnScreen	 22mIf the menu is automatically positioned under
	       the cursor with the 1mXawPositionSimpleMenu0m
	       action, and this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the
	       menu will always be fully visible on the

1m4.2.2.  SimpleMenu Actions0m

The SimpleMenu widget supports the following actions:

    Switching the entry under the mouse pointer between the
     foreground and background colors with 1mhighlight 22mand
     1munhighlight0m

    Processing menu entry callbacks with 1mnotify0m


The following are the default translation bindings used by
the SimpleMenu widget:



     <EnterWindow>:   highlight()
     <LeaveWindow>:   unhighlight()
     <BtnMotion>:     highlight()
     <BtnUp>:	      MenuPopdown() notify() unhighlight()





			     1m940m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The user can pop down the menu without activating any of the
callback functions by releasing the pointer button when no
menu item is highlighted.


The full list of actions supported by SimpleMenu is:

1mhighlight22m()    Highlight the menu entry that is currently
	       under the pointer.  Only a item that is high-
	       lighted will be notified when the 1mnotify0m
	       action is invoked.  The look of a highlighted
	       entry is determined by the menu entry.

1munhighlight22m()  Unhighlights the currently highlighted menu
	       item, and returns it to its normal look.

1mnotify22m()	    Notifies the menu entry that is currently
	       highlighted that is has been selected.  It is
	       the responsibility of the menu entry to take
	       the appropriate action.

1mMenuPopdown22m(4mmenu24m)
	       This action is defined in 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrin-0m
	       4msics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.

1m4.2.3.  Positioning the SimpleMenu0m

If the SimpleMenu widget is to be used as a pulldown menu
then the MenuButton widget, or some other outside means
should be used to place the menu when it is popped up.

If popup menus are desired it will be necessary to add the
1mXawPositionSimpleMenu 22mand 1mMenuPopup 22mactions to the transla-
tion table of the widget that will be popping up the menu.
The 1mMenuPopup 22maction is described in 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--0m
4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m.  1mXawPositionSimpleMenu 22mis a global
action procedure registered by the SimpleMenu widget when
the first one is created or the convenience routine 1mXawSim-0m
1mpleMenuAddGlobalActions 22mis called.

Translation writers should be aware that Xt does not regis-
ter grabs on ``don't care'' modifiers, and therefore the
left hand side of the production should be written to
exclude unspecified modifiers.	For example these are the
translations needed to popup some of 1mxterm's 22mmenus:



     !Ctrl<Btn1Down>: XawPositionSimpleMenu(xterm) MenuPopup(xterm)
     !Ctrl<Btn2Down>: XawPositionSimpleMenu(modes) MenuPopup(modes)







			     1m950m

1mXawPositionSimpleMenu22m(4mmenu24m)
		      The 1mXawPositionSimpleMenu 22mroutine will
		      search for the menu name passed to it
		      using 1mXtNameToWidget 22mstarting with the
		      widget invoking the action as the ref-
		      erence widget.  If it is unsuccessful
		      it will continue up the widget tree
		      using each of the invoking widget's
		      ancestors as the reference widget.  If
		      it is still unsuccessful it will print
		      a warning message and give up.  1mXawPo-0m
		      1msitionSimpleMenu 22mwill position the
		      menu directly under the pointer cur-
		      sor.  The menu will be placed so that
		      the pointer cursor is centered on the
		      entry named by the 1mpopupOnEntry0m
		      resource.	 If the 1mmenuOnScreen0m
		      resource is 1mTrue 22mthen the menu will
		      always be fully visible on the screen.

1m4.2.4.  Convenience Routines0m

1m4.2.4.1.  Registering the Global Action Routines0m

The 1mXawPositionSimpleMenu 22maction routine may often be
invoked before any menus have been created.  This can occur
when an application uses dynamic menu creation.	 In these
cases an application will need to register this global
action routine by calling 1mXawSimpleMenuAddGlobalActions22m:

void XawSimpleMenuAddGlobalActions(4mapp_con24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_con24m;


4mapp_con24m   Specifies the application context in which this
	  action should be registered.

This function need only be called once per application and
must be called before any widget that uses 1mXawPositionSim-0m
1mpleMenu 22maction is realized.

1m4.2.4.2.  Getting and Clearing the Current Menu Entry0m

To get the currently highlighted menu entry use 1mXawSimple-0m
1mMenuGetActiveEntry22m:

Widget XawSimpleMenuGetActiveEntry(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the SimpleMenu widget.

This function returns the menu entry that is currently high-
lighted, or NULL if no entry is highlighted.



			     1m960m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


To clear the SimpleMenu widget's internal information about
the currently highlighted menu entry use 1mXawSimpleMenuClear-0m
1mActiveEntry22m:

Widget XawSimpleMenuClearActiveEntry(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the SimpleMenu widget.

This function unsets all internal references to the cur-
rently highlighted menu entry.	It does not 4munhighlight24m or
otherwise alter the appearance of the active entry.  This
function is primarily for use by implementors of menu
entries.

The SmeBSB object is used to create a menu entry that con-
tains a string, and optional bitmaps in its left and right
margins.  Since each menu entry is an independent object,
the application is able to change the font, color, height,
and other attributes of the menu entries, on an entry by
entry basis.  The format of the string may either be the
encoding of the 8 bit 1mfont 22mutilized, or in a multi-byte
encoding for use with a 1mfontSet22m.

The resources associated with the SmeBSB object are defined
in this section, and affect only the single menu entry spec-
ified by this object.

1m4.5.2.  Subclassing the Sme Object0m


To Create a new Sme object 4mclass24m you will need to define
three class methods.  These methods allow the SimpleMenu to
highlight and unhighlight the menu entry as the pointer cur-
sor moves over it, as well as notify the entry when the user
has selected it.  All of these methods may be inherited from
the Sme object, although the default semantics are not very
interesting.

1mHighlight22m()
	  Called to put the menu entry into the highlighted
	  state.

1mUnhighlight22m()
	  Called to return the widget to its normal (unhigh-
	  lighted) state.

1mNotify22m()  Called when the user selects this menu entry.


Other then these methods, creating a new object is straight
forward.  Here is some information that may help you avoid
some common mistakes.

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1) Objects can be zero pixels high.

2) Objects draw on their parent's window, therefore the
   Drawing dimensions are different from those of widgets.
   For instance, y locations vary from 1my 22mto 1my + height22m, not
   1m0 22mto 1mheight22m.

3) XtSetValues calls may come from the application while the
   Sme is highlighted, and if the SetValues method returns
   True, will result in an expose event.  The SimpleMenu may
   later call the menu entry's 1munhighlight 22mprocedure.  How-
   ever, due to the asynchronous nature of X, the expose
   event generated by 1mXtSetValues 22mwill come 4mafter24m this
   unhighlight.

4) Remember that your subclass of the Sme does not own the
   window.  Share the space with other menu entries, and
   refrain from drawing outside the subclass's own section
   of the menu.

Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/MenuButtonP.h>
Class		    menuButtonWidgetClass

Superclass	    Command



The MenuButton widget is an area, often rectangular, that
displays a graphic.  The graphic may be a text string con-
taining multiple lines of characters in an 8 bit or 16 bit
character set (to be displayed with a 4mfont24m), or in a multi-
byte encoding (for use with a 4mfontset24m).  The graphic may
also be a bitmap or pixmap.

When the pointer cursor is on a MenuButton widget, the
MenuButton becomes highlighted by drawing a rectangle around
its perimeter.	This highlighting indicates that the
MenuButton is ready for selection.  When a pointer button is
pressed, the MenuButton widget will pop up the menu named in
the 1mmenuName 22mresource.

1m4.6.1.  Resources0m

When creating a MenuButton widget instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the

	       this widget.  A widget is insensitive if
	       either it or any of its ancestors is insensi-
	       tive.  This resource should not be changed
	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

bitmap	       A bitmap to display instead of the 1mlabel22m.
	       The default size of the widget will be just
	       large enough to contain the bitmap and the
	       widget's internal width and height.  The
	       resource converter for this resource con-
	       structs bitmaps from the contents of files.
	       (See 1mConverting Bitmaps 22mfor details.)  If
	       this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will
	       be rendered in the foreground color, and the
	       0's in the background color.  If 1mbitmap 22mhas a
	       depth greater than one, it is copied directly
	       into the window.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border
	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

callback       A list of routines to be called when the
	       1mnotify 22maction is invoked.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

cornerRoundPercent
	       When a 1mShapeStyle 22mof 1mroundedRectangle 22mis
	       used, this resource controls the radius of
	       the rounded corner.  The radius of the
	       rounded corners is specified as a percentage
	       of the length of the shortest side of the
	       widget.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

font	       The text font to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mfalse22m.

fontSet	       The text font set to use when displaying the
	       1mlabel22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mtrue22m.

foreground     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       widget's window.	 This color is also used to
	       render all 1's in a 1mbitmap 22mone plane deep.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

highlightThickness
	       The thickness of the rectangle that is used
	       to highlight the internal border of this wid-
	       get, alerting the user that it is ready to be
	       selected.  The default value is 2 pixels if
	       the 1mshapeStyle 22mis 1mrectangle22m, and 0 Pixels (no
	       highlighting) otherwise.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

internalHeight
internalWidth  The minimum amount of space to leave between
	       the graphic and the vertical and horizontal
	       edges of the window.

international  This is a boolean flag, only settable at wid-
	       get creation time.  A value of 1mfalse 22msignals
	       the widget to use pre-R6 internationalization
	       (specifically, the lack thereof), such as



			     1m1060m

	       using fonts for displaying text, etc.  A
	       value of 1mtrue 22mdirects the widget to act in an
	       internationalized manner, such as utilizing
	       font sets for displaying text, etc.

justify	       Specifies left, center, or right alignment of
	       graphic within the widget.  This resource may
	       be specified with the values 1mXtJustifyLeft22m,
	       1mXtJustifyCenter22m, or 1mXtJustifyRight22m.  A con-
	       verter is registered for this resource that
	       will convert the following strings: 1mleft,0m
	       1mright, 22mand 1mcenter22m.  This resource only has
	       noticeable effect when the width of the wid-
	       get is larger than necessary to display the
	       graphic.	 Note that when the graphic is a
	       multi-line 1mlabel22m, the longest line will obey
	       this justification while shorter lines will
	       be left-justified with the longest one.


label	       Specifies the text string to be displayed in
	       the widget's window if no bitmap is speci-
	       fied.  The default is the name of this wid-
	       get.  Regardless of the value of 1mencoding 22mor
	       1minternational22m, a single newline character (1
	       byte) will cause a line break.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

1mmenuName	 22mThe name of a popup shell to popup as a menu.
	       The MenuButton will search for this name
	       using 1mXtNameToWidget 22mstarting with itself as
	       the reference widget.  If the search is
	       unsuccessful the widget will continue up the
	       widget tree using each of its ancestors as
	       the reference widget passed to 1mXtNameToWid-0m
	       1mget22m.  If no widget of called 1mmenuName 22mis
	       found by this algorithm, the widget will
	       print a warning message and give up.  When
	       the menu is found it will be popped up exclu-
	       sive and spring_loaded.	The MenuButton wid-
	       get does not copy the value of this resource
	       into newly allocated memory. The application
	       programmer must pass the resource value in
	       nonvolatile memory.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

resize	       Specifies whether the widget should attempt
	       to resize to its preferred dimensions when-
	       ever its resources are modified with 1mXtSet-0m
	       1mValues22m.  This attempt to resize may be denied
	       by the parent of this widget.  The parent is
	       always free to resize the widget regardless
	       of the state of this resource.

	       This is not a settable resource.

sensitive      Whether or not the toolkit should pass user
	       events to this widget.  The widget will not
	       get input events if either 1mancestorSensitive0m
	       or 1msensitive 22mis 1mFalse22m.

shapeStyle     Nonrectangular widgets may be created using
	       this resource.  Nonrectangular widgets are
	       supported only on a server that supports the
	       1mShape Extension22m.  If nonrectangular widgets
	       are specified for a server lacking this
	       extension, the shape is ignored and the wid-
	       gets will be rectangular.  The following
	       shapes are currently supported: 1mXmuShapeRect-0m
	       1mangle22m, 1mXmuShapeOval22m, 1mXmuShapeEllipse22m, and
	       1mXmuShapeRoundedRectangle22m.  A converter is
	       registered for this resource that will con-
	       vert the following strings: 1mrectangle, oval,0m
	       1mellipse, 22mand 1mroundedRectangle22m.

1m4.6.3.  MenuButton Actions0m

The full list of actions supported by MenuButton is:

1mhighlight22m(4mcondition24m)
	       Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that con-
	       trasts with the interior color of the Command
	       widget.	The conditions 1mWhenUnset 22mand 1mAlways0m
	       are understood by this action procedure.	 If
	       no argument is passed, 1mWhenUnset 22mis assumed.

1munhighlight22m()  Displays the internal highlight border in the
	       color (1mXtNforeground 22mor 1mbackground 22m) that
	       matches the interior color of the MenuButton
	       widget.

1mset22m()	    Enters the 4mset24m state, in which 1mnotify 22mis pos-
	       sible.  This action causes the button to dis-
	       play its interior in the 1mforeground 22mcolor.
	       The label or bitmap is displayed in the 1mback-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor.

1munset22m()	    Cancels the 4mset24m state and displays the inte-
	       rior of the button in the 1mbackground 22mcolor.
	       The label or bitmap is displayed in the 1mfore-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor.

1mreset22m()	    Cancels any 1mset 22mor 1mhighlight 22mand displays the
	       interior of the button in the 1mbackground0m
	       color, with the label displayed in the 1mfore-0m
	       1mground 22mcolor.

1mnotify22m()	    When the button is in the 1mset 22mstate this
	       action calls all functions in the callback
	       list named by the 1mcallback 22mresource.  The
	       value of the call_data argument in these
	       callback functions is undefined.

1mPopupMenu22m()    Pops up the menu specified by the 1mmenuName0m
	       resource.

The MenuButton widget does not place a server grab on
itself.	 Instead, PopupMenu is registered as a grab action.
As a result, clients which popup menus without using
XtMenuPopup or MenuPopup or PopupMenu in translations will
fail to have a grab active.  They should make a call to
XtRegisterGrabAction on the appropriate action in the appli-
cation initialization routine, or use a different transla-
tion.

			1mText Widgets0m




The Text widget provides a window that will allow an appli-
cation to display and edit one or more lines of text.
Options are provided to allow the user to add Scrollbars to
its window, search for a specific string, and modify the
text in the buffer.

The Text widget is made up of a number of pieces; it was
modularized to ease customization.  The AsciiText widget
class (actually not limited to ASCII but so named for com-
patibility) is be general enough to most needs.	 If more
flexibility, special features, or extra functionality is
needed, they can be added by implementing a new TextSource
or TextSink, or by subclassing the Text Widget (See Section
5.8 for customization details.)

The words 4minsertion24m 4mpoint24m are used in this chapter to refer
to the text caret.  This is the symbol that is displayed
between two characters in the file.  The insertion point
marks the location where any new characters will be added to
the file.  To avoid confusion the pointer cursor will always
be referred to as the 4mpointer24m.

The text widget supports three edit modes, controlling the
types of modifications a user is allowed to make:

    Append-only

    Editable

    Read-only

Read-only mode does not allow the user or the programmer to
modify the text in the widget.	While the entire string may
be reset in read-only mode with 1mXtSetValues22m, it cannot be
modified via with 1mXawTextReplace22m.	Append-only and editable
modes allow the text at the insertion point to be modified.
The only difference is that text may only be added to or
removed from the end of a buffer in append-only mode.


1m5.1.	Text Widget for Users0m

The Text widget provides many of the common keyboard editing
commands.  These commands allow users to move around and
edit the buffer.  If an illegal operation is attempted,



			     1m1110m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


(such as deleting characters in a read-only text widget),
the X server will beep.

1m5.1.1.  Default Key Bindings0m

The default key bindings are patterned after those in the
EMACS text editor:


Ctrl-a	  Beginning Of Line   Meta-b	     Backward Word
Ctrl-b	  Backward Character  Meta-f	     Forward Word
Ctrl-d	  Delete Next Character		     Meta-iInsert File

Ctrl-y	  Unkill	      Meta-Shift BackspaceKill Previous Word
Ctrl-z	  Scroll One Line Up
Ctrl-\	  Reconnect to input method
Kanji	  Reconnect to input method



In addition, the pointer may be used to cut and paste text:


	  Button 1 Down	 Start Selection
	  Button 1 MotionAdjust Selection
	  Button 1 Up	 End Selection (cut)

	  Button 2 Down	 Insert Current Selection (paste)

	  Button 3 Down	 Extend Current Selection
	  Button 3 MotionAdjust Selection
	  Button 3 Up	 End Selection (cut)



Since all of these key and pointer bindings are set through
the translations and resource manager, the user and the
application programmer can modify them by changing the Text

1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


widget's 1mtranslations 22mresource.

1m5.1.2.  Search and Replace0m

The Text widget provides a search popup that can be used to
search for a string within the current Text widget.  The
popup can be activated by typing either 4mControl-r24m or 4mCon-0m
4mtrol-s24m.  If 4mControl-s24m is used the search will be forward in
the file from the current location of the insertion point;
if 4mControl-r24m is used the search will be backward.	The acti-
vated popup is placed under the pointer.  It has a number of
buttons that allow both text searches and text replacements
to be performed.

At the top of the search popup are two toggle buttons
labeled 4mbackward24m and 4mforward24m.	 One of these buttons will
always be highlighted; this is the direction in which the
search will be performed.  The user can change the direction
at any time by clicking on the appropriate button.

Directly under the buttons there are two text areas, one
labeled 4mSearch24m 4mfor:24m and the other labeled 4mReplace24m 4mwith:24m.  If
this is a read-only Text widget the 4mReplace24m 4mwith:24m field will
be insensitive and no replacements will be allowed.  After
each of these labels will be a text field.  This field will
allow the user to enter a string to search for and the
string to replace it with.  Only one of these text fields
will have a window border around it; this is the active text
field.	Any key presses that occur when the focus in in the
search popup will be directed to the active text field.
There are also a few special key sequences:

     1mCarriage Return22m: Execute the action, and pop down the search widget.
     1mTab22m:		   Execute the action, then move to the next field.
     1mShift Carriage Return22m:Execute the action, then move to the next field.
     1mControl-q Tab22m:   Enter a Tab into a text field.
     1mControl-c22m:	   Pop down the search popup.


Using these special key sequences should allow simple
searches without ever removing one's hands from the key-
board.

Near the bottom of the search popup is a row of buttons.
These buttons allow the same actions to to be performed as
the key sequences, but the buttons will leave the popup
active.	 This can be quite useful if many searches are being
performed, as the popup will be left on the display.  Since
the search popup is a transient window, it may be picked up
with the window manager and pulled off to the side for use
at a later time.

1mSearch	 22mSearch for the specified string.




			     1m1130m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1mReplace	 22mReplace the currently highlighted string with
	       the string in the 4mReplace24m 4mwith24m text field,
	       and move onto the next occurrence of the
	       4mSearch24m 4mfor24m text field.	 The functionality is
	       commonly referred to as query-replace.

1mReplace-All	 22mReplace all occurrences of the search string
	       with the replace string from the current
	       insertion point position to the end (or
	       beginning) of the file.	There is no key
	       sequence to perform this action.

1mCancel	 22mRemove the search popup from the screen.

Finally, when 1minternational 22mresource is 1mtrue22m, there may be a
pre-edit buffer below the button row, for composing input.
Its presence is determined by the X locale in use and the
VendorShell's 1mpreeditType 22mresource.

The widget hierarchy for the search popup is show below, all
widgets are listed by class and instance name.

1m5.1.3.  File Insertion0m

To insert a file into a text widget, type the key sequence
4mMeta-i24m, which will activate the file insert popup.	 This
popup will appear under the pointer, and any text typed
while the focus is in this popup will be redirected to the
text field used for the filename.  When the desired filename
has been entered, click on 4mInsert24m 4mFile24m, or type 4mCarriage0m
4mReturn24m.  The named file will then be inserted in the text
widget beginning at the insertion point position.  If an
error occurs when opening the file, an error message will be
printed, prompting the user to enter the filename again.
The file insert may be aborted by clicking on 4mCancel24m.  If
4mMeta-i24m is typed at a text widget that is read-only, it will
beep, as no file insertion is allowed.

1m5.1.4.  Text Selections for Users0m

The text widgets have a text selection mechanism that allows
the user to copy pieces of the text into the 1mPRIMARY 22mselec-
tion, and paste into the text widget some text that another
application (or text widget) has put in the 1mPRIMARY 22mselec-
tion.

One method of selecting text is to press pointer button 1 on
the beginning of the text to be selected, drag the pointer
until all of the desired text is highlighted, and then
release the button to activate the selection.  Another
method is to click pointer button 1 at one end of the text
to be selected, then click pointer button 3 at the other
end.

To modify a currently active selection, press pointer button
3 near either the end of the selection that you want to
adjust.	 This end of the selection may be moved while hold-
ing down pointer button 3.  When the proper area has been
highlighted release the pointer button to activate the
selection.

The selected text may now be pasted into another applica-
tion, and will remain active until some other client makes a
selection.  To paste text that some other application has
put into the 1mPRIMARY 22mselection use pointer button 2.  First
place the insertion point where you would like the text to
be inserted, then click and release pointer button 2.

Rapidly clicking pointer button 1 the following number of
times will adjust the selection as described.

1mTwo	    22mSelect the word under the pointer.  A word bound-
	  ary is defined by the Text widget to be a Space,

1m5.2.1.  Cursor Movement Actions0m



forward-character()
backward-character()
		    These actions move the insert point for-
		    ward or backward one character in the
		    buffer.  If the insert point is at the
		    end or beginning of a line this action
		    will move the insert point to the next
		    (or previous) line.

forward-word()
backward-word()	    These actions move the insert point to
		    the next or previous word boundary.	 A
		    word boundary is defined as a Space, Tab
		    or Carriage Return.

forward-paragraph()
backward-paragraph()
		    These actions move the insert point to
		    the next or previous paragraph boundary.
		    A paragraph boundary is defined as two
		    Carriage Returns in a row with only Spa-
		    ces or Tabs between them.

beginning-of-line()
end-of-line()	    These actions move to the beginning or
		    end of the current line.  If the insert
		    point is already at the end or beginning
		    of the line then no action is taken.

next-line()
previous-line()	    These actions move the insert point up
		    or down one line.  If the insert point
		    is currently N characters from the
		    beginning of the line then it will be N
		    characters from the beginning of the
		    next or previous line.  If N is past the
		    end of the line, the insert point is
		    placed at the end of the line.

next-page()
previous-page()	    These actions move the insert point up
		    or down one page in the file.  One page
		    is defined as the current height of the
		    text widget.  The insert point is always
		    placed at the first character of the top
		    line by this action.

beginning-of-file()
end-of-file()	    These actions place the insert point at
		    the beginning or end of the current text



			     1m1170m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    buffer.  The text widget is then
		    scrolled the minimum amount necessary to
		    make the new insert point location visi-
		    ble.

scroll-one-line-up()
scroll-one-line-down()
		    These actions scroll the current text
		    field up or down by one line.  They do
		    not move the insert point.	Other than
		    the scrollbars this is the only way that
		    the insert point may be moved off of the
		    visible text area.	The widget will be
		    scrolled so that the insert point is
		    back on the screen as soon as some other
		    action is executed.

1m5.2.2.  Delete Actions0m



delete-next-character()
delete-previous-character()
		    These actions remove the character imme-
		    diately before or after the insert
		    point.  If a Carriage Return is removed
		    then the next line is appended to the
		    end of the current line.

delete-next-word()
delete-previous-word()
		    These actions remove all characters
		    between the insert point location and
		    the next word boundary.  A word boundary
		    is defined as a Space, Tab or Carriage
		    Return.

delete-selection()  This action removes all characters in
		    the current selection.  The selection
		    can be set with the selection actions.

1m5.2.3.  Selection Actions0m



select-word()	    This action selects the word in which
		    the insert point is currently located.
		    If the insert point is between words
		    then it will select the previous word.

select-all()	    This action selects the entire text
		    buffer.





			     1m1180m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


select-start()	    This action sets the insert point to the
		    current pointer location (if triggered
		    by a button event) or text cursor loca-
		    tion (if triggered by a key event).	 It
		    will then begin a selection at this
		    location.  If many of these selection
		    actions occur quickly in succession then
		    the selection count mechanism will be
		    invoked (see the section titled 1mText0m
		    1mSelections for Application Programmers0m
		    for details).

select-adjust()	    This action allows a selection started
		    with the 4mselect-start24m action to be modi-
		    fied, as described above.

select-end(4mname24m[,4mname24m,...])
		    This action ends a text selection that
		    began with the 4mselect-start24m action, and
		    asserts ownership of the selection or
		    selections specified.  A 4mname24m can be a
		    selection (e.g., 1mPRIMARY22m) or a cut
		    buffer (e.g., 1mCUT_BUFFER022m).  Note that
		    case is important.	If no 4mnames24m are
		    specified, 1mPRIMARY 22mis asserted.

extend-start()	    This action finds the nearest end of the
		    current selection, and moves it to the
		    current pointer location (if triggered
		    by a button event) or text cursor loca-
		    tion (if triggered by a key event).

extend-adjust()	    This action allows a selection started
		    with an 4mextend-start24m action to be modi-
		    fied.

extend-end(4mname24m[,4mname24m,...])
		    This action ends a text selection that
		    began with the 4mextend-start24m action, and
		    asserts ownership of the selection or
		    selections specified.  A 4mname24m can be a
		    selection (e.g. 1mPRIMARY22m) or a cut buffer
		    (e.g 1mCUT_BUFFER022m).  Note that case is
		    important.	If no names are given, 1mPRI-0m
		    1mMARY 22mis asserted.

insert-selection(4mname24m[,4mname24m,...])
		    This action retrieves the value of the
		    first (left-most) named selection that
		    exists or the cut buffer that is not
		    empty and inserts it into the Text wid-
		    get at the current insert point loca-
		    tion. A 4mname24m can be a selection (e.g.
		    1mPRIMARY22m) or a cut buffer (e.g



			     1m1190m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    1mCUT_BUFFER022m).	Note that case is impor-
		    tant.

1m5.2.4.  The New Line Actions0m



newline-and-indent()
		    This action inserts a newline into the
		    text and adds spaces to that line to
		    indent it to match the previous line.

newline-and-backup()
		    This action inserts a newline into the
		    text 4mafter24m the insert point.

newline()	    This action inserts a newline into the
		    text 4mbefore24m the insert point.

1m5.2.5.  Kill and Actions0m



kill-word()
backward-kill-word()
		    These actions act exactly like the
		    4mdelete-next-word24m and 4mdelete-previous-0m
		    4mword24m actions, but they stuff the word
		    that was killed into the kill buffer
		    (1mCUT_BUFFER_122m).

kill-selection()    This action deletes the current selec-
		    tion and stuffs the deleted text into
		    the kill buffer (1mCUT_BUFFER_122m).

kill-to-end-of-line()
		    This action deletes the entire line to
		    the right of the insert point position,
		    and stuffs the deleted text into the
		    kill buffer (1mCUT_BUFFER_122m).

kill-paragraph()    This action deletes the current para-
		    graph, if between paragraphs it deletes
		    the paragraph above the insert point,
		    and stuffs the deleted text into the
		    kill buffer (1mCUT_BUFFER_122m).

kill-to-end-of-paragraph()
		    This action deletes everything between
		    the current insert point location and
		    the next paragraph boundary, and stuffs
		    the deleted text into the kill buffer
		    (1mCUT_BUFFER_122m).




			     1m1200m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1m5.2.6.  Miscellaneous Actions0m



redraw-display()    This action recomputes the location of
		    all the text lines on the display,
		    scrolls the text to vertically center
		    the line containing the insert point on
		    the screen, clears the entire screen,
		    and redisplays it.

insert-file([4mfilename24m])
		    This action activates the insert file
		    popup.  The 4mfilename24m option specifies
		    the default filename to put in the file-
		    name buffer of the popup.  If no 4mfile-0m
		    4mname24m is specified the buffer is empty at
		    startup.

insert-char()	    This action may only be attached to a
		    key event. When the 1minternational0m
		    resource is 1mfalse22m, this action calls
		    XLookupString to translate the event
		    into a (rebindable) Latin-1 character
		    (sequence) and inserts it into the text
		    at the insert point.  When the 1minterna-0m
		    1mtional 22mresource is 1mtrue22m, characters are
		    passed to the input method via
		    XwcLookupString, and any committed
		    string returned is inserted into the
		    text at the insert point.

insert-string(4mstring24m[,4mstring24m,...])
		    This action inserts each 4mstring24m into the
		    text at the insert point location.	Any
		    4mstring24m beginning with the characters
		    "0x" followed by an even number of hexa-
		    decimal digits is interpreted as a hexa-
		    decimal constant and the corresponding
		    string is inserted instead.	 This hexa-
		    decimal string may represent up to 50
		    8-bit characters.
		     When the1minternational 22mresource is 1mtrue22m,
		    a hexadecimal string is intrepeted as
		    being in a multi-byte encoding, and a
		    hexadecimal or regular string will
		    result in an error message if it is not
		    legal in the current locale.

display-caret(4mstate24m,4mwhen24m)
		    This action allows the insert point to
		    be turned on and off.  The 4mstate24m argu-
		    ment specifies the desired state of the
		    insert point.  This value may be any of



			     1m1210m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    the string values accepted for Boolean
		    resources (e.g. 1mon22m, 1mTrue22m, 1moff22m, 1mFalse22m,
		    etc.).  If no arguments are specified,
		    the default value is 1mTrue22m.  The 4mwhen0m
		    argument specifies, for 1mEnterNotify 22mor
		    1mLeaveNotify 22mevents whether or not the
		    focus field in the event is to be exam-
		    ined.  If the second argument is not
		    specified, or specified as something
		    other than 1malways 22mthen if the action is
		    bound to an	 1mEnterNotify 22mor 1mLeaveNotify0m
		    event, the action will be taken only if
		    the focus field is 1mTrue22m.  An augmented
		    binding that might be useful is:


		    *Text.Translations: #override \
			 <FocusIn>:	display-caret(on) \n\
			 <FocusOut>:	display-caret(off)


focus-in()
focus-out()	    These actions do not currently do any-
		    thing.

search(4mdirection24m,[4mstring24m])
		    This action activates the search popup.
		    The 4mdirection24m must be specified as
		    either 1mforward 22mor 1mbackward22m.  The string
		    is optional and is used as an initial
		    value for the 4mSearch24m 4mfor24m: string.	 For
		    further explanation of the search widget
		    see the section on 1mText Searches22m.

multiply(4mvalue24m)	 The multiply action allows the user to
		    multiply the effects of many of the text
		    actions.  Thus the following action
		    sequence 4mmultiply(10)24m 4mdelete-next-word()0m
		    will delete 10 words.  It does not mat-
		    ter whether these actions take place in
		    one event or many events.  Using the
		    default translations the key sequence
		    4mControl-u,24m 4mControl-d24m will delete 4 char-
		    acters.  Multiply actions can be
		    chained, thus 4mmultiply(5)24m 4mmultiply(5)24m is
		    the same as 4mmultiply(25)24m.  If the string
		    1mreset 22mis passed to the multiply action
		    the effects of all previous multiplies
		    are removed and a beep is sent to the
		    display.

form-paragraph()    This action removes all the Carriage
		    Returns from the current paragraph and
		    reinserts them so that each line is as



			     1m1220m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    long as possible, while still fitting on
		    the current screen.	 Lines are broken at
		    word boundaries if at all possible.
		    This action currently works only on Text
		    widgets that use ASCII text.

transpose-characters()
		    This action will swap the position of
		    the character to the left of the insert
		    point with the character to the right of
		    the insert point.  The insert point will
		    then be advanced one character.

no-op([4maction24m])	 The no-op action makes no change to the
		    text widget, and is mainly used to over-
		    ride translations.	This action takes
		    one optional argument.  If this argument
		    is 4mRingBell24m then a beep is sent to the
		    display.

XawWMProtocols([4mwm_protocol_name24m])

		    This action is written specifically for
		    the file insertion and the search and
		    replace dialog boxes.  This action is
		    attached to those shells by the Text
		    widget, in order to handle ClientMessage
		    events with the WM_PROTOCOLS atom in the
		    detail field.  This action supports
		    WM_DELETE_WINDOW on the Text widget pop-
		    ups, and may support other window man-
		    ager protocols if necessary in the
		    future.  The popup will be dismissed if
		    the window manager sends a
		    WM_DELETE_WINDOW request and there are
		    no parameters in the action call, which
		    is the default.  The popup will also be
		    dismissed if the parameters include the
		    string ``wm_delete_window,'' and the
		    event is a ClientMessage event request-
		    ing dismissal or is not a ClientMessage
		    event.  This action is not sensitive to
		    the case of the strings passed as param-
		    eters.

reconnect-im()	    When the 1minternational 22mresource is 1mtrue22m,
		    input is usually passed to an input
		    method, a separate process, for compos-
		    ing.  Sometimes the connection to this
		    process gets severed; this action will
		    attempt to reconnect it.  Causes for
		    severage include network trouble, and
		    the user explicitly killing one input
		    method and starting a new one.  This



			     1m1230m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


		    action may also establish first connec-
		    tion when the application is started
		    before the input method.

1m5.2.7.  Text Selections for Application Programmers0m

The default behavior of the text selection array is
described in the section called 1mText Selections for Users22m.
To modify the selections a programmer must construct a 1mXaw-0m
1mTextSelectType 22marray (called the selection array), contain-
ing the selections desired, and pass this as the new value
for the 1mselectionTypes 22mresource.  The selection array may
also be modified using the 1mXawTextSetSelectionArray 22mfunc-
tion.  All selection arrays must end with the value 1mXawse-0m
1mlectNull22m.	The 1mselectionTypes 22mresource has no converter reg-
istered and cannot be modified through the resource manager.

The array contains a list of entries that will be called
when the user attempts to select text in rapid succession
with the 4mselect-start24m action (usually by clicking a pointer
button).  The first entry in the selection array will be
used when the 4mselect-start24m action is initially called.  The
next entry will be used when 4mselect-start24m is called again,
and so on.  If a timeout value (1/10 of a second) is
exceeded, the the next 4mselect-start24m action will begin at the
top of the selection array.  When 1mXawselectNull 22mis reached
the array is recycled beginning with the first element.

1mXawselectAll	 22mSelects the contents of the entire buffer.
1mXawse-	 22mSelects text characters as the pointer
1mlectChar	 22mmoves over them.
1mXawselect-	 22mSelects the entire line.
1mLine0m
1mXawselect-	 22mIndicates the end of the selection array.
1mNull0m
1mXawselect-	 22mSelects the entire paragraph.
1mParagraph0m
1mXawselectPo-	 22mSelects the current pointer position.
1msition0m
1mXawselect-	 22mSelects whole words as the pointer moves
1mWord		 22monto them.


The default selectType array is:



{XawselectPosition, XawselectWord, XawselectLine, XawselectParagraph, XawselectAll, XawselectNull}



The selection array is not copied by the text widgets.	The
application must allocate space for the array and cannot
deallocate or change it until the text widget is destroyed



			     1m1240m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


or until a new selection array is set.

1m5.3.	Default Translation Bindings0m

The following translations are defaults built into every

fying a new value for the Text widget's 1mtranslations0m

1m5.4.	Text Functions0m

The following functions are provided as convenience routines
for use with the Text widget.  Although many of these
actions can be performed by modifying resources, these
interfaces are frequently more efficient.

These data structures are defined in the Text widget's pub-
lic header file, <X11/Xaw/Text.h>.

typedef long XawTextPosition;


Character positions in the Text widget begin at 0 and end at
n, where n is the number of characters in the Text source
widget.


typedef struct {
     int 4mfirstPos24m;
     int 4mlength24m;
     char *4mptr24m;
     unsigned long 4mformat24m;

4mfirstPos24m  The first position, or index, to use within the
	  4mptr24m field.  The value is commonly zero.

4mlength24m    The number of characters to be used from the 4mptr0m
	  field.  The number of characters used is commonly
	  the number of characters in 4mptr24m, and must not be



			     1m1260m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	  greater than the length of the string in 4mptr24m.

4mptr24m       Contains the string to be referenced by the Text
	  widget.

4mformat24m    This flag indicates whether the data pointed to by
	  1mptr 22mis char or wchar_t.	When the associated wid-
	  get has 1minternational 22mset to 1mfalse 22mthis field must
	  be XawFmt8Bit.  When the associated widget has
	  1minternational 22mset to 1mtrue 22mthis field must be
	  either XawFmt8Bit or XawFmtWide.

Note: Previous versions of Xaw used 4mFMT8BIT24m, which has been
retained for backwards compatibility. 1mFMT8BIT 22mis deprecated
and will eventually be removed from the implementation.

1m5.4.1.  Selecting Text0m

To select a piece of text, use 4mXawTextSetSelection24m:

void XawTextSetSelection(4mw24m, 4mleft24m, 4mright24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     XawTextPosition 4mleft24m, 4mright24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mleft24m      Specifies the character position at which the
	  selection begins.

4mright24m     Specifies the character position at which the
	  selection ends.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  If
redisplay is enabled, this function highlights the text and
makes it the 1mPRIMARY 22mselection.  This function does not have
any effect on 1mCUT_BUFFER022m.


1m5.4.2.  Unhighlighting Text0m

To unhighlight previously highlighted text in a widget, use
1mXawTextUnsetSelection22m:

void XawTextUnsetSelection(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

1m5.4.3.  Getting Current Text Selection0m

To retrieve the text that has been selected by this text
widget use 1mXawTextGetSelectionPos22m:



			     1m1270m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void XawTextGetSelectionPos(4mw24m, 4mbegin_return24m, 4mend_return24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     XawTextPosition *4mbegin_return24m, *4mend_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mbegin_return0m
	  Returns the beginning of the text selection.

4mend_return0m
	  Returns the end of the text selection.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  If
the returned values are equal, no text is currently
selected.

1m5.4.4.  Replacing Text0m

To modify the text in an editable Text widget use 1mXawTextRe-0m
1mplace22m:

int XawTextReplace(4mw24m, 4mstart24m, 4mend24m, 4mtext24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     XawTextPosition 4mstart24m, 4mend24m;
     XawTextBlock *4mtext24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mstart24m     Specifies the starting character position of the
	  text replacement.

4mend24m       Specifies the ending character position of the
	  text replacement.

4mtext24m      Specifies the text to be inserted into the file.

This function will not be able to replace text in read-only
text widgets.  It will also only be able to append text to
an append-only text widget.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition 22mand
1mXawTextBlock22m.

This function may return the following values:

1mXawEditDone 22mThe text replacement was successful.

1mXawPositionError0m
	    The edit mode is 1mXawtextAppend 22mand 4mstart24m is not
	    the position of the last character of the
	    source.




			     1m1280m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1mXawEditError0m
	    Either the Source was read-only or the range to
	    be deleted is larger than the length of the
	    Source.


The 1mXawTextReplace 22marguments 4mstart24m and 4mend24m represent the
text source character positions for the existing text that
is to be replaced by the text in the text block.  The char-
acters from 4mstart24m up to but not including 4mend24m are deleted,
and the characters specified on the text block are inserted
in their place.	 If 4mstart24m and 4mend24m are equal, no text is
deleted and the new text is inserted after 4mstart24m.

1m5.4.5.  Searching for Text0m

To search for a string in the Text widget, use 1mXaw-0m
1mTextSearch22m:

XawTextPosition XawTextSearch(4mw24m, 4mdir24m, 4mtext24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextScanDirection 4mdir24m;
      XawTextBlock * 4mtext24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mdir24m       Specifies the direction to search in.  Legal val-
	  ues are 1mXawsdLeft 22mand 1mXawsdRight22m.

4mtext24m      Specifies a text block structure that contains the
	  text to search for.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition 22mand
1mXawTextBlock22m.  The 1mXawTextSearch 22mfunction will begin at the
insertion point and search in the direction specified for a
string that matches the one passed in 4mtext24m.  If the string
is found the location of the first character in the string
is returned.  If the string could not be found then the
value 1mXawTextSearchError 22mis returned.

1m5.4.6.  Redisplaying Text0m

To redisplay a range of characters, use 1mXawTextInvalidate22m:

void XawTextInvalidate(4mw24m, 4mfrom24m, 4mto24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mfrom24m, 4mto24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mfrom24m      Specifies the start of the text to redisplay.




			     1m1290m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mto24m	       Specifies the end of the text to redisplay.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  The
1mXawTextInvalidate 22mfunction causes the specified range of
characters to be redisplayed immediately if redisplay is
enabled or the next time that redisplay is enabled.


To enable redisplay, use 1mXawTextEnableRedisplay22m:

void XawTextEnableRedisplay(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

The 1mXawTextEnableRedisplay 22mfunction flushes any changes due
to batched updates when 1mXawTextDisableRedisplay 22mwas called
and allows future changes to be reflected immediately.


To disable redisplay while making several changes, use 1mXaw-0m
1mTextDisableRedisplay22m.

void XawTextDisableRedisplay(4mw24m)
       Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

The 1mXawTextDisableRedisplay 22mfunction causes all changes to
be batched until either 1mXawTextDisplay 22mor 1mXawTextEnableRe-0m
1mdisplay 22mis called.


To display batched updates, use 1mXawTextDisplay22m:

void XawTextDisplay(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

The 1mXawTextDisplay 22mfunction forces any accumulated updates
to be displayed.

1m5.4.7.  Resources Convenience Routines0m

To obtain the character position of the left-most character
on the first line displayed in the widget (the value of the
1mdisplayPosition 22mresource), use 1mXawTextTopPosition22m.






			     1m1300m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


XawTextPosition XawTextTopPosition(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.


To assign a new selection array to a text widget use 1mXaw-0m
1mTextSetSelectionArray22m:

void XawTextSetSelectionArray(4mw24m, 4msarray24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextSelectType * 4msarray24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4msarray24m    Specifies a selection array as defined in the sec-
	  tion called 1mText Selections for Application Pro-0m
	  1mgrammers22m.

Calling this function is equivalent to setting the value of
the 1mselectionTypes 22mresource.


To move the insertion point to the specified source posi-
tion, use 1mXawTextSetInsertionPoint22m:

void XawTextSetInsertionPoint(4mw24m, 4mposition24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mposition24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mposition24m  Specifies the new position for the insertion
	  point.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  The
text will be scrolled vertically if necessary to make the
line containing the insertion point visible.  Calling this
function is equivalent to setting the 1minsertPosition0m
resource.


To obtain the current position of the insertion point, use
1mXawTextGetInsertionPoint22m:

XawTextPosition XawTextGetInsertionPoint(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.




			     1m1310m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  The
result is equivalent to retrieving the value of the 1minsert-0m
1mPosition 22mresource.


To replace the text source in the specified widget, use 1mXaw-0m
1mTextSetSource22m:

void XawTextSetSource(4mw24m, 4msource24m, 4mposition24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Widget 4msource24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mposition24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4msource24m    Specifies the text source object.

4mposition24m  Specifies character position that will become the
	  upper left hand corner of the displayed text.
	  This is usually set to zero.

See section 5.4 for a description of 1mXawTextPosition22m.  A
display update will be performed if redisplay is enabled.


To obtain the current text source for the specified widget,
use 1mXawTextGetSource22m:

Widget XawTextGetSource(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

This function returns the text source that this Text widget
is currently using.


To enable and disable the insertion point, use 1mXawTextDis-0m
1mplayCaret22m:

void XawTextDisplayCaret(4mw24m, 4mvisible24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Boolean 4mvisible24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Text widget.

4mvisible24m   Specifies whether or not the caret should be dis-
	  played.

If 4mvisible24m is 1mFalse 22mthe insertion point will be disabled.
The marker is re-enabled either by setting 4mvisible24m to 1mTrue22m,



			     1m1320m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


by calling 1mXtSetValues22m, or by executing the 4mdisplay-caret0m
action routine.

1m5.5.	Ascii Text Widget0m



Application Header file<X11/Xaw/AsciiText.h>

Class		    asciiTextWidgetClass
Class Name	    Text
Superclass	    Text
Sink Name	    textSink
Source Name	    textSource



For the ease of internationalization, the AsciiText widget
class name has not been changed, although it is actually
able to support non-ASCII locales.  The AsciiText widget is
really a collection of smaller parts.  It includes the Text
widget itself, a ``Source'' (which supports memory manage-
ment), and a ``Sink'' (which handles the display).  There
are currently two supported sources, the AsciiSrc and Multi-
Src, and two supported sinks, the AsciiSink and MultiSink.
Some of the resources listed below are not actually
resources of the AsciiText, but belong to the associated
source or sink.	 This is is noted in the explanation of each
resource where it applies.  When specifying these resources
in a resource file it is necessary to use 4m*Asci-0m
4miText*resource_name24m instead of 4m*AsciiText.resource_name24m,
since they actually belong to the children of the AsciiText
widget, and not the AsciiText widget itself.  However, these
resources may be set directly on the AsciiText widget at
widget creation time, or via 1mXtSetValues22m.

1m5.5.1.  Resources0m

When creating an AsciiText widget instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the
resource database:

	       for details).

ancestorSensitive
	       The sensitivity state of the ancestors of
	       this widget.  A widget is insensitive if
	       either it or any of its ancestors is insensi-
	       tive.  This resource should not be changed
	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

autoFill       If this resource is 1mTrue 22mthe text widget will
	       automatically break a line when the user
	       attempts to type into the right margin.	The
	       attribute has no effect on files or text
	       inserted into the text widget.  It only
	       checks to see if the action should be taken
	       when a user enters a new character via the
	       4minsert-character24m action.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border
	       color.

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

bottomMargin
leftMargin
rightMargin
topMargin      The amount of space, in pixels, between the
	       edge of the window and the corresponding edge
	       of the text within the window.  If there is a
	       scrollbar active on this edge, then this is
	       the space between the text and the scrollbar.

callback       The callbacks registered on this resource
	       will be called every time the text buffer
	       changes, after the text has been updated.



			     1m1350m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	       This is a resource of the associated source.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

cursorName     The name of the symbol to use to represent
	       the pointer cursor.  This resource will over-
	       ride the 1mcursor 22mresource if both are speci-
	       fied. (See 2.4.1)

dataCompression
	       The AsciiSrc uses an algorithm that may cause
	       the text buffer to grow to about twice the
	       size of the actual text over time, as the
	       text is edited.	On systems where CPU cycles
	       are cheaper than memory, it is helpful to
	       spend some extra time to compress this buffer
	       back to its minimum size.  If this resource
	       is 1mTrue22m, the AsciiSrc will compress its data
	       to the minimum size required every time the
	       text string is saved, or the value of the
	       string is queried.  This is a resource of the
	       associated source.

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

displayCaret   Whether or not to display the text insert
	       point.

displayNonprinting
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, the Text widget
	       will display all non-printable characters as
	       the string 4m^@24m.  If 1mFalse22m, the Text widget
	       will just leave a blank space where a non-
	       printable character exists in the text
	       buffer.	This is a resource of the associated
	       sink.

displayPosition
	       The position in the text buffer of the char-
	       acter that is currently displayed in the
	       upper left hand corner of the text display.

editType       This is the type of editing that will be
	       allowed in this text widget.  Legal values
	       are 1mXawtextRead22m, 1mXawtextEdit22m, and



			     1m1360m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	       1mXawtextAppend22m.  A converter is registered for
	       this resource that will convert the following
	       strings: 1mread, edit, 22mand 1mappend22m.  This is a
	       resource of the associated source.

echo	       Whether or not to echo characters to the
	       screen.	The buffer can still be edited, but
	       nothing is displayed.  This mode can be use-
	       ful for entering passwords and other sensi-
	       tive information.  This is a resource of the
	       associated sink.

font	       The text font to use when displaying the
	       1mstring22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mfalse22m.  This is a resource of the associated
	       sink.

font	       The text font set to use when displaying the
	       1mstring22m, when the 1minternational 22mresource is
	       1mtrue22m.  This is a resource of the associated
	       sink.

foreground     A pixel value which indexes the Text widget's
	       colormap to derive the foreground color used
	       by the text sink.  This is a resource of the
	       associated sink.

height

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

insertPosition This is the location of the insert point.  It
	       is expressed in characters from the beginning
	       of the file.  The cursor will always be
	       forced to be on the screen.  This resource
	       may therefore be used to scroll the text dis-
	       play to a certain character position.

length	       If the 1museStringInPlace 22mresource is 1mFalse0m
	       this attribute has no effect.  If that
	       resource is 1mTrue22m, however, then the 1mlength0m
	       resource specifies the length of the buffer
	       passed to the text widget in the 1mstring0m
	       resource.  This is a resource of the associ-
	       ated source.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

pointerColorBackground
		 A pixel value which indexes the widget's
		 colormap to derive the background color of

pieceSize      This is the size of the internal chunks into
	       which the text buffer is broken down for mem-
	       ory management.	The larger this value the
	       less segmented your memory will be, but the
	       slower your editing will be.  The text wid-
	       gets will always allocate a chunk of memory
	       this size to stuff the 1mstring 22minto, so when
	       using small strings, having this buffer large
	       can waste memory.  This resource has no
	       effect if 1museStringInPlace 22mis 1mTrue22m.  This is
	       a resource of the associated source.

resize	       Controls whether or not the Text widget
	       attempts to resize itself when it is no
	       longer able to display the full text buffer
	       in the associated window.  Any attempt by the
	       Text widget to resize itself is always sub-
	       ject to the constraints imposed by its par-
	       ent.  The values 1mXawtextResizeNever22m, 1mXawtex-0m
	       1mtResizeWidth22m, 1mXawtextResizeHeight22m, and 1mXaw-0m

scrollHorizontal
scrollVertical These resources control the placement of

Class Name	    AsciiSrc or MultiSrc
Superclass	    TextSource


The AsciiSrc or MultiSrc object is used by a text widget to
read the text from a file or string in memory.	Depending on
its 1minternational 22mresource, an AsciiText widget will create
one or the other of these when the AsciiText itself is cre-
ated.  Both types are nearly identical; the following dis-
cussion applies to both, with MultiSrc differences noted
only as they occur.

The AsciiSrc understands all Latin1 characters plus Tab and
Carriage Return.  4mThe24m 4mMultiSrc24m 4munderstands24m 4many24m 4mset24m 4mof24m 4mchar-0m

4mtionalization24m 4mhandles.0m

The AsciiSrc can be either of two types: 1mXawAsciiFile 22mor
1mXawAsciiString22m.

AsciiSrc objects of type 1mXawAsciiFile 22mread the text from a
file and store it into an internal buffer.  This buffer may
then be modified, provided the text widget is in the correct
edit mode, just as if it were a source of type 1mXawAsci-0m
1miString22m.  Unlike R3 and earlier versions of the AsciiSrc, it
is now possible to specify an editable disk source.  The
file is not updated, however, until a call to 1mXawAsciiSave0m
is made.  When the source is in this mode the 1museStringIn-0m
1mPlace 22mresource is ignored.

AsciiSrc objects of type 1mXawAsciiString 22mhave the text buffer
implemented as a string.  4mMultiSrc24m 4mobjects24m 4mof24m 4mtype24m 1mXawAsci-0m

4mstring.24m  1mThe string owner is responsible for allocating and0m
1mmanaging storage for the string.0m

In the default case for AsciiSrc objects of type 1mXawAsci-0m
1miString22m, the resource 1museStringInPlace 22mis false, and the
widget owns the string.	 The initial value of the string
resource, and any update made by the application programmer
to the string resource with 1mXtSetValues22m, is copied into mem-
ory private to the widget, and managed internally by the
widget.	 The application writer does not need to worry about
running out of buffer space (subject to the total memory
available to the application).	The performance does not
decay linearly as the buffer grows large, as is necessarily
the case when the text buffer is used in place.	  The appli-
cation writer must use 1mXtGetValues 22mto determine the contents
of the text buffer, which will return a copy of the widget's
text buffer as it existed at the time of the 1mXtGetValues0m
call.	This copy is not affected by subsequent updates to
the text buffer, i.e., it is not updated as the user types
input into the text buffer.  This copy is freed upon the
next call to XtGetValues to retrieve the string resource;



			     1m1410m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


however, to conserve memory, there is a convenience routine,
1mXawAsciiSourceFreeString22m, allowing the application program-
mer to direct the widget to free the copy.

When the resource 1museStringInPlace 22mis true and the AsciiSrc
object is of type 1mXawAsciiString22m, the application is the
string owner.  The widget will take the value of the string
resource as its own text buffer, and the 1mlength 22mresource
indicates the buffer size.   In this case the buffer con-
tents change as the user types at the widget; it is not nec-
essary to call 1mXtGetValues 22mon the string resource to deter-
mine the contents of the buffer--it will simply return the
address of the application's implementation of the text
buffer.

1m5.6.1.  Resources0m

When creating an AsciiSrc object instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the
resource database:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName		     Class		Type		 Notes	 Default Value0m
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
callback	   Callback	      XtCallbackList	       NULL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1mcallback	 22mThe callbacks registered on this resource
	       will be called every time the text buffer
	       changes, after the text has been updated.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

1mdataCompression0m
	       The AsciiSrc uses an algorithm that may cause
	       the text buffer to grow to about twice the
	       size of the actual text over time, as the
	       text is edited.	On systems where CPU cycles
	       are cheaper than memory, it is helpful to
	       spend some extra time to compress this buffer
	       back to its minimum size.  If this resource
	       is 1mTrue22m, the AsciiSrc will compress its data



			     1m1420m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


	       to the minimum size required every time the
	       text string is saved, or the value of the
	       string is queried.

editType       This is the type of editing that will be
	       allowed in this text widget.  Legal values
	       are 1mXawtextRead22m, 1mXawtextEdit22m, and 1mXawtextAp-0m
	       1mpend22m.  A converter is registered for this
	       resource that will convert the following
	       strings: 1mread, edit, 22mand 1mappend22m.

1mlength	 22mIf the 1museStringInPlace 22mresource is 1mFalse0m
	       this attribute has no effect.  If that
	       resource is 1mTrue22m, however, then the 1mlength0m
	       resource specifies the length of the buffer
	       passed to the text widget in the 1mstring0m
	       resource.

1mpieceSize	 22mThis is the size of the internal chunks into
	       which the text buffer is broken down for mem-
	       ory management.	The larger this value the
	       less segmented your memory will be, but the
	       slower your editing will be.  The text wid-
	       gets will always allocate a chunk of memory
	       this size to stuff the 1mstring 22minto, so when
	       using small strings, having this buffer large
	       can waste memory.  This resource has no
	       effect if 1museStringInPlace 22mis 1mTrue22m.

1mstring	 22mIf 1mtype 22mis 1mXawAsciiString 22mthen this string
	       contains the buffer to be displayed in the
	       widget.	If 1mtype 22mis 1mXawAsciiFile 22mthen the
	       string contains the name of the file to be
	       displayed.  This string is normally copied by
	       the text widget into internal memory, but may
	       be used in place by setting the 1museStringIn-0m
	       1mPlace 22mresource.  As of X11R4 this is a set-
	       table resource.	When the 1mstring 22mresource is
	       queried, using 1mXtGetValues22m, and 1museStringIn-0m
	       1mPlace 22mis false, the value returned is valid
	       until the next time the 1mstring 22mresource is
	       queried, or until the application writer
	       calls 1mXawAsciiSourceFreeString22m.  If 1museS-0m
	       1mtringInPlace 22mis true, a pointer to the actual
	       string is returned.  See also section 5.6.

1mtype		 22mThis resource may be either 1mXawAsciiString 22mor
	       1mXawAsciiFile22m.  The value of this resource
	       determines whether the 1mstring 22mresource con-
	       tains the name of a file to be opened or a
	       buffer to be displayed by the text widget.  A
	       converter has been registered for this
	       resource and accepts the values 1mstring 22mand
	       1mfile22m.

1museStringInPlace0m
	       Setting this resource to 1mTrue 22mwill disable
	       the memory management provided by the Text
	       widget, updating the 1mstring 22mresource in

1m5.6.2.  Convenience Routines0m

The AsciiSrc has a few convenience routines that allow the
application programmer quicker or easier access to some of
the commonly used functionality of the AsciiSrc.

1m5.6.2.1.  Conserving Memory0m

When the AsciiSrc widget is not in 1museStringInPlace 22mmode
space must be allocated whenever the file is saved, or the
string is requested with a call to 1mXtGetValues22m.  This memory
is allocated on the fly, and remains valid until the next
time a string needs to be allocated.  You may save memory by
freeing this string as soon as you are done with it by call-
ing 1mXawAsciiSourceFreeString22m.

void XawAsciiSourceFreeString(4mw24m)
Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the AsciiSrc object.

This function will free the memory that contains the string
pointer returned by 1mXtGetValues22m.  This will normally happen
automatically when the next call to 1mXtGetValues 22moccurs, or
when the widget is destroyed.

1m5.6.2.2.  Saving Files0m

To save the changes made in the current text source into a
file use 1mXawAsciiSave22m.





			     1m1440m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


Boolean XawAsciiSave(4mw24m)
Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the AsciiSrc object.

1mXawAsciiSave 22mreturns 1mTrue 22mif the save was successful.	 It
will update the file named in the 1mstring 22mresource.	 If the
buffer has not been changed, no action will be taken.  This
function only works on an AsciiSrc of type 1mXawAsciiFile22m.


To save the contents of the current text buffer into a named
file use 1mXawAsciiSaveAsFile22m.

Boolean XawAsciiSaveAsFile(4mw24m, 4mname24m)

String 4mname24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the AsciiSrc object.

4mname24m      The name of the file to save the current buffer
	  into.

This function returns 1mTrue 22mif the save was successful.
1mXawAsciiSaveAsFile 22mwill work with a buffer of either type
1mXawAsciiString 22mor type 1mXawAsciiFile22m.

1m5.6.2.3.  Seeing if the Source has Changed0m

To find out if the text buffer in an AsciiSrc object has
changed since the last time it was saved with 1mXawAsciiSave0m
or queried use 1mXawAsciiSourceChanged22m.

Boolean XawAsciiSourceChanged(4mw24m)
Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the AsciiSrc object.

This function will return 1mTrue 22mif the source has changed
since the last time it was saved or queried.  The internal
change flag is reset whenever the string is queried via
1mXtGetValues 22mor the buffer is saved via 1mXawAsciiSave22m.

The AsciiSink or MultiSink object is used by a text widget
to render the text.  Depending on its 1minternational0m
resource, a AsciiText widget will create one or the other of
these when the AsciiText itself is created.  Both types are
nearly identical; the following discussion applies to both,
with MultiSink differences noted only as they occur.  The
AsciiSink will display all printing characters in an 8 bit
font, along with handling Tab and Carriage Return.  The name
has been left as ``AsciiSink'' for compatibility.  4mThe24m 4mMul-0m

1m5.8.	Customizing the Text Widget0m


The remainder of this chapter will describe customizing the
Text widget.  The Text widget may be customized by subclass-
ing, or by creating new sources and sinks.  Subclassing is
described in detail in Chapter 7; this section will describe
only those things that are specific to the Text widget.
Attributes of the Text widget base class and creating new
sources and sinks will be discussed.

The Text widget is made up of a number of different pieces,
with the Text widget as the base widget class.	It and the
AsciiText widget are the only true "widgets" in the Text
widget family.	The other pieces (sources and sinks) are X
Toolkit objects and have no window associated with them.  No
source or sink is useful unless assigned to a Text widget.

Each of the following pieces of the Text widget has a spe-
cific purpose, and will be, or has been, discussed in detail
in this chapter:

1mText		 22mThis is the glue that binds everything else
	       together.  This widget reads the text data
	       from the source, and displays the information
	       in the sink.  All translations and actions
	       are handled in the Text widget itself.

1mTextSink	 22mThis object is responsible for displaying and
	       clearing the drawing area.  It also reports
	       the configuration of the window that contains
	       the drawing area.  The TextSink does not have
	       its own window; instead it does its drawing
	       on the Text widget's window.

1mTextSrc	 22mThis object is responsible for reading, edit-
	       ing and searching through the text buffer.



			     1m1470m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1mAsciiSink	 22mThis object is a subclass of the TextSink and
	       knows how to display ASCII text.	 Support has
	       been added to display any 8-bit character
	       set, given the font.

1mMultiSink	 22mThis object is a subclass of the TextSink and
	       knows how to display font sets.

1mAsciiSrc	 22mThis object is a subclass of the TextSrc and
	       knows how to read strings and files.

1mMultiSrc	 22mThis object is a subclass of the TextSrc and
	       knows how to read strings and multibyte
	       files, converting them to wide characters
	       based on locale.

1mAsciiText	 22mThis widget is a subclass of the Text widget.
	       When created, the AsciiText automatically
	       creates and attaches either an AsciiSrc and
	       AsciiSink, or a MultiSrc and MultiSink, to
	       itself.	The AsciiText provides the simplest
	       interface to the Athena Text widgets.

The Text widget is the glue that binds all the other pieces
together, it maintains the internal state of the displayed
text, and acts as a mediator between the source and sink.

This section lists the resources that are actually part of
the Text widget, and explains the functionality provided by
each.

accelerators   A list of event to action bindings to be exe-
	       cuted by this widget, even though the event
	       occurred in another widget.  (See the 4mX24m 4mTool-0m

	       with 1mXtSetValues22m, although it may be queried.

1mautoFill	 22mIf this resource is 1mTrue 22mthe text widget will
	       automatically break a line when the user
	       attempts to type into the right margin.	The
	       attribute has no effect on files or text
	       inserted into the text widget.  It only
	       checks to see if the action should be taken
	       when a user enters a new character via the
	       4minsert-character24m action.

background     A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

backgroundPixmap
	       The background pixmap of this widget's win-
	       dow.  If this resource is set to anything
	       other than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap
	       specified will be used instead of the back-
	       ground color.

borderColor    A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the border color of the wid-
	       get's window.

borderPixmap   The border pixmap of this widget's window.
	       If this resource is set to anything other
	       than 1mXtUnspecifiedPixmap22m, the pixmap speci-
	       fied will be used instead of the border

borderWidth    The width of this widget's window border.

1mbottomMargin0m
1mleftMargin0m
1mrightMargin0m
1mtopMargin	 22mThe amount of space, in pixels, between the
	       edge of the window and the corresponding edge
	       of the text within the window.  If there is a
	       scrollbar active on this edge, then this is
	       the space between the text and the scrollbar.

colormap       The colormap that this widget will use.

cursor	       The image that will be displayed as the
	       pointer cursor whenever it is in this widget.
	       The use of this resource is deprecated in
	       favor of 1mcursorName22m.

	       specified. (See 2.4.1)

depth	       The depth of this widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

1mdisplayCaret	 22mWhether or not to display the text insert
	       point.

1mdisplayPosition0m
	       The position in the text buffer of the char-
	       acter that is currently displayed in the
	       upper left hand corner of the text display.

height
width	       The height and width of this widget in pix-
	       els.

insensitiveBorder
	       This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's
	       border if the widget becomes insensitive.

1minsertPosition 22mThis is the location of the insert point.  It
	       is expressed in characters from the beginning
	       of the file.  The cursor will always be
	       forced to be on the screen.  This resource
	       may therefore be used to scroll the text dis-
	       play to a certain character position.

mappedWhenManaged
	       If this resource is 1mTrue22m, then the widget's
	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

pointerColor   A pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the foreground color of the
	       pointer symbol specified by the 1mcursorName0m
	       resource.

	       This is not a settable resource.

1mscrollHorizontal0m
1mscrollVertical 22mThese resources control the placement of
	       scrollbars on the left and bottom edge of the
	       text widget.  These resources accept the val-
	       ues 1mXawtextScrollAlways22m, 1mXawtextScrollWhen-0m
	       1mNeeded22m, and 1mXawtextScrollNever22m.  A converter
	       is registered for this resource that will
	       convert the following strings: 1malways, never,0m
	       and 1mwhenNeeded22m.  If 1mXawtextScrollWhenNeeded0m
	       is specified, the appropriate scrollbar will
	       only appear when there is text in the buffer
	       that is not able to fit within the bounds of
	       the current window.  The scrollbar will dis-
	       appear when the text once again fits within
	       the window.

1mselectTypes	 22mSpecifies the selection type array that is
	       used when multi-click is activated (see 1mText0m
	       1mSelections for Application Programmers 22mfor
	       details).  This resource is used in place,
	       and must not be freed until the widget is
	       destroyed.  There is no type converter regis-
	       tered for this resource, so it may not be set
	       from the resource manager.

sensitive      Whether or not the toolkit should pass user
	       events to this widget.  The widget will not

	       1mXawtextWrapLine 22mall text that is beyond the
	       right edge of the window will be displayed on
	       the next line.  With 1mXawtextWrapWord 22mthe same
	       action occurs but the text is broken at a
	       word boundary if possible.  If no wrapping is
	       enabled then the text will extend off the
	       edge of the window, and a small rectangle
	       will be painted in the right margin to alert
	       the user that this line is too long.  A con-
	       verter is registered for this resource that
	       will convert the following strings: 1mnever,0m

1m5.10.	 TextSrc Object0m



Application Header file<X11/Xaw/TextSrc.h>
Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/TextSrcP.h>
Class		    textSrcObjectClass
Class Name	    TextSrc
Superclass	    Object


The TextSrc object is the root object for all text sources.
Any new text source objects should be subclasses of the
TextSrc Object.	 The TextSrc Class contains all methods the
Text widget expects a text source to export.

Since all text sources will have some resources in common
the TextSrc defines a few new resources.

1m5.10.1.  Resources0m

When creating an TextSrc object instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the
resource database:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName		    Class	 Type		  Notes	  Default Value0m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
destroyCallback	  Callback     XtCallbackList		NULL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
editType	  EditType     EditMode			NULL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

1meditType	 22mThis is the type of editing that will be
	       allowed in this text widget.  Legal values
	       are 1mXawtextRead22m, 1mXawtextEdit22m, and 1mXawtextAp-0m
	       1mpend22m.  A converter is registered for this
	       resource that will convert the following
	       strings: 1mread, edit, 22mand 1mappend22m.

1m5.10.2.  Subclassing the TextSrc0m

The only purpose of the TextSrc Object is to be subclassed.
It contains the minimum set of class methods that all text
sources must have.  All class methods of the TextSrc must be
defined, as the Text widget uses them all.  While all may be
inherited, the direct descendant of TextSrc 1mmust 22mspecify
some of them as TextSrc does not contain enough information
to be a valid text source by itself.  Do not try to use the
TextSrc as a valid source for the Text widget; it is not
intended to be used as a source by itself and bad things
will probably happen.

1m5.10.2.1.  Reading Text.0m

To read the text in a text source use the 1mRead 22mfunction:

XawTextPosition Read(4mw24m, 4mpos24m, 4mtext_return24m, 4mlength24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XawTextPosition 4mpos24m;
XawTextBlock 4m*text_return24m;
int 4mlength24m;





			     1m1540m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mpos24m       Specifies the position of the first character to
	  be read from the text buffer.

4mtext24m      Returns the text read from the source.

4mlength24m    Specifies the maximum number of characters the
	  TextSrc should return to the application in
	  4mtext_return24m.

This function returns the text position immediately after
the characters read from the text buffer.  The function is
not required to read 4mlength24m characters if that many charac-
ters are in the file, it may break at any point that is con-
venient to the internal structure of the source.  It may
take several calls to 1mRead 22mbefore the desired portion of the
text buffer is fully retrieved.

1m5.10.2.2.  Replacing Text.0m

To replace or edit the text in a text buffer use the 1mReplace0m
function:

XawTextPosition Replace(4mw24m, 4mstart24m, 4mend24m, 4mtext24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XawTextPosition 4mstart24m, 4mend24m;
XawTextBlock 4m*text24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mstart24m     Specifies the position of the first character to
	  be removed from the text buffer.  This is also the
	  location to begin inserting the new text.

4mend24m       Specifies the position immediately after the last
	  character to be removed from the text buffer.

4mtext24m      Specifies the text to be added to the text source.

This function can return any of the following values:

1mXawEditDone 22mThe text replacement was successful.

1mXawPositionError0m
	    The edit mode is 1mXawtextAppend 22mand 4mstart24m is not
	    the last character of the source.

1mXawEditError0m
	    Either the Source was read-only or the range to
	    be deleted is larger than the length of the
	    Source.




			     1m1550m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The 1mReplace 22marguments 4mstart24m and 4mend24m represent the text
source character positions for the existing text that is to
be replaced by the text in the text block.  The characters
from 4mstart24m up to but not including 4mend24m are deleted, and the
buffer specified by the text block is inserted in their
place.	If 4mstart24m and 4mend24m are equal, no text is deleted and
the new text is inserted after 4mstart24m.

1m5.10.2.3.  Scanning the TextSrc0m

To search the text source for one of the predefined boundary
types use the 1mScan 22mfunction:

XawTextPosition Scan(4mw24m, 4mposition24m, 4mtype24m, 4mdir24m, 4mcount24m, 4minclude24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XawTextPosition 4mposition24m;
XawTextScanType 4mtype24m;
XawTextScanDirection 4mdir24m;
int 4mcount24m;
Boolean 4minclude24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mposition24m  Specifies the position to begin scanning the
	  source.

4mtype24m      Specifies the type of boundary to scan for, may be
	  one of: 1mXawstPosition22m, 1mXawstWhiteSpace22m, 1mXawstEOL22m,
	  1mXawstParagraph22m, 1mXawstAll22m.  The exact meaning of
	  these boundaries is left up to the individual text
	  source.

4mdir24m       Specifies the direction to scan, may be either
	  1mXawsdLeft 22mto search backward, or 1mXawsdRight 22mto
	  search forward.

4mcount24m     Specifies the number of boundaries to scan for.

4minclude24m   Specifies whether the boundary itself should be
	  included in the scan.

The 1mScan 22mfunction returns the position in the text source of
the desired boundary.  It is expected to return a valid
address for all calls made to it, thus if a particular
request is made that would take the text widget beyond the
end of the source it must return the position of that end.

1m5.10.2.4.  Searching through a TextSrc0m

To search for a particular string use the 1mSearch 22mfunction.






			     1m1560m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


XawTextPosition Search(4mw24m, 4mposition24m, 4mdir24m, 4mtext24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XawTextPosition 4mposition24m;
XawTextScanDirection 4mdir24m;
XawTextBlock 4m*text24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mposition24m  Specifies the position to begin the search.

4mdir24m       Specifies the direction to search, may be either
	  1mXawsdLeft 22mto search backward, or 1mXawsdRight 22mto
	  search forward.

4mtext24m      Specifies a text block containing the text to
	  search for.

This function will search through the text buffer attempting
to find a match for the string in the text block.  If a
match is found in the direction specified, then the charac-
ter location of the first character in the string is
returned.  If no text was found then 1mXawTextSearchError 22mis
returned.

1m5.10.2.5.  Text Selections0m

While many selection types are handled by the Text widget,
text sources may have selection types unknown to the Text
widget.	 When a selection conversion is requested by the X
server the Text widget will first call the 1mConvertSelection0m
function, to attempt the selection conversion.

Boolean ConvertSelections(4mw24m, 4mselection24m, 4mtarget24m, 4mtype24m, 4mvalue_return24m, 4mlength_return24m, 4mformat_return24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
Atom 4m*selection24m, 4m*target24m, 4m*type24m;
caddr_t 4m*value_return24m;
unsigned long 4m*length_return24m;
int 4m*format_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mselection24m Specifies the type of selection that was requested
	  (e.g. 1mPRIMARY22m).

4mtarget24m    Specifies the type of the selection that has been
	  requested, which indicates the desired information
	  about the selection (e.g. Filename, Text, Window).

4mtype24m      Specifies a pointer to the atom into which the
	  property type of the converted value of the selec-
	  tion is to be stored.	 For instance, either file
	  name or text might have property type 1mXA_STRING22m.



			     1m1570m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mvalue_return0m
	  Returns a pointer into which a pointer to the con-
	  verted value of the selection is to be stored.
	  The selection owner is responsible for allocating
	  this storage.	 The memory is considered owned by
	  the toolkit, and is freed by XtFree when the
	  Intrinsics selection mechanism is done with it.

4mlength_return0m
	  Returns a pointer into which the number of ele-
	  ments in value is to be stored.  The size of each
	  element is determined by 4mformat24m.

4mformat_return0m
	  Returns a pointer into which the size in bits of
	  the data elements of the selection value is to be
	  stored.

If this function returns 1mTrue 22mthen the Text widget will
assume that the source has taken care of converting the
selection, Otherwise the Text widget will attempt to convert
the selection itself.


If the source needs to know when the text selection is modi-
fied it should define a 1mSetSelection 22mprocedure:

void SetSelection(4mw24m, 4mstart24m, 4mend24m, 4mselection24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XawTextPosition 4mstart24m, 4mend24m;
Atom 4mselection24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSrc object.

4mstart24m     Specifies the character position of the beginning
	  of the new text selection.

4mend24m       Specifies the character position of the end of the
	  new text selection.

4mselection24m Specifies the type of selection that was requested
	  (e.g. 1mPRIMARY22m).

1m5.11.	 TextSink Object0m



Application Header file<X11/Xaw/TextSink.h>
Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/TextSinkP.h>
Class		    textSinkObjectClass
Class Name	    TextSink
Superclass	    Object




			     1m1580m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The TextSink object is the root object for all text sinks.
Any new text sink objects should be subclasses of the
TextSink Object.  The TextSink Class contains all methods
that the Text widget expects a text sink to export.

Since all text sinks will have some resources in common, the
TextSink defines a few new resources.

1m5.11.1.  Resources0m

When creating an TextSink object instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the
resource database:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName		    Class	 Type		  Notes	  Default Value0m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
background	  Background   Pixel			XtDefaultBackground
destroyCallback	  Callback     XtCallbackList		NULL
foreground	  Foreground   Pixel			XtDefaultForeground
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1mbackground	 22mA pixel value which indexes the widget's col-
	       ormap to derive the background color of the
	       widget's window.

destroyCallback
	       All functions on this list are called when
	       this widget is destroyed.

1mforeground	 22mA pixel value which indexes the Text widget's
	       colormap to derive the foreground color used
	       by the text sink.

1m5.11.2.  Subclassing the TextSink0m

The only purpose of the TextSink Object is to be subclassed.
It contains the minimum set of class methods that all text
sinks must have.  While all may be inherited, the direct
descendant of TextSink 1mmust specify 22msome of them as TextSink
does contain enough information to be a valid text sink by
itself.	 Do not try to use the TextSink as a valid sink for
the Text widget; it is not intended to be used as a sink by
itself.

DisplayText	    XtInheritDisplayText	 XawTextSinkDisplayText		yes
InsertCursor	    XtInheritInsertCursor	 XawTextSinkInsertCursor	yes
ClearToBackground   XtInheritClearToBackground	 XawTextSinkClearToBackground	no

GetCursorBounds	    XtInheritGetCursorBounds	 XawTextSinkGetCursorBounds	yes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1m5.11.2.1.  Displaying Text0m

To display a section of the text buffer contained in the
text source use the function 1mDisplayText22m:

void DisplayText(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mpos124m, 4mpos224m, 4mhighlight24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m, 4my24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mpos124m, 4mpos224m;
      Boolean 4mhighlight24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mx24m	       Specifies the x location to start drawing the
	  text.

4my24m	       Specifies the y location to start drawing text.

4mpos124m      Specifies the location within the text source of
	  the first character to be printed.

4mpos224m      Specifies the location within the text source of
	  the last character to be printed.

4mhighlight24m Specifies whether or not to paint the text region
	  highlighted.

The Text widget will only pass one line at a time to the
text sink, so this function does not need to know how to
line feed the text.  It is acceptable for this function to
just ignore Carriage Returns.  4mx24m and 4my24m denote the upper left
hand corner of the first character to be displayed.

1m5.11.2.2.  Displaying the Insert Point0m

The function that controls the display of the text cursor is
1mInsertCursor22m.  This function will be called whenever the
text widget desires to change the state of, or move the
insert point.




			     1m1600m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void InsertCursor(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mstate24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m, 4my24m;
      XawTextInsertState 4mstate24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mx24m	       Specifies the x location of the cursor in Pixels.

4my24m	       Specifies the y location of the cursor in Pixels.

4mstate24m     Specifies the state of the cursor, may be one of
	  1mXawisOn 22mor 1mXawisOff22m.

4mX24m and 4my24m denote the upper left hand corner of the insert
point.

1m5.11.2.3.  Clearing Portions of the Text window0m

To clear a portion of the Text window to its background
color, the Text widget will call 1mClearToBackground22m.  The
TextSink object already defines this function as calling
1mXClearArea 22mon the region passed.  This behavior will be used
if you specify 1mXtInheritClearToBackground 22mfor this method.

void ClearToBackground(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m, 4my24m;
      Dimension 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mx24m	       Specifies the x location, in pixels, of the Region
	  to clear.

4my24m	       Specifies the y location, in pixels, of the Region
	  to clear.

4mwidth24m     Specifies the width, in pixels, of the Region to
	  clear.

4mheight24m    Specifies the height, in pixels, of the Region to
	  clear.

4mX24m and 4my24m denote the upper left hand corner of region to
clear.

1m5.11.2.4.  Finding a Text Position Given Pixel Values0m

To find the text character position that will be rendered at
a given x location the Text widget uses the function 1mFindPo-0m
1msition22m:



			     1m1610m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void FindPosition(4mw24m, 4mfromPos24m, 4mfromX24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mstopAtWordBreak24m, 4mpos_return24m, 4mwidth_return24m, 4mheight_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mfromPos24m;
      int 4mfromX24m, 4mwidth24m;
      Boolean 4mstopAtWordBreak24m;
      XawTextPosition 4m*pos_return24m;
      int 4m*width_return24m, 4m*height_return24m;


4mw24m		 Specifies the TextSink object.

4mfromPos24m	 Specifies a reference position, usually the
	    first character in this line.  This character is
	    always to the left of the desired character
	    location.

4mfromX24m	 Specifies the distance that the left edge of
	    4mfromPos24m is from the left edge of the window.
	    This is the reference x location for the refer-
	    ence position.

4mwidth24m	 Specifies the distance, in pixels, from the ref-
	    erence position to the desired character posi-
	    tion.

4mstopAtWordBreak0m
	    Specifies whether or not the position that is
	    returned should be forced to be on a word bound-
	    ary.

4mpos_return24m	 Returns the character position that corresponds
	    to the location that has been specified, or the
	    work break immediately to the left of the posi-
	    tion if 4mstopAtWordBreak24m is 1mTrue22m.

4mwidth_return0m
	    Returns the actual distance between 4mfromPos24m and
	    4mpos_return.0m

4mheight_return0m
	    Returns the maximum height of the text between
	    4mfromPos24m and 4mpos_return.0m

This function need make no attempt to deal with line feeds.
The text widget will only call it one line at a time.


Another means of finding a text position is provided by the
1mResolve 22mfunction:








			     1m1620m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void Resolve(4mw24m, 4mfromPos24m, 4mfromX24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mpos_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mfromPos24m;
      int 4mfromX24m, 4mwidth24m;
      XawTextPosition 4m*pos_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mfromPos24m   Specifies a reference position, usually the first
	  character in this line.  This character is always
	  to the left of the desired character location.

4mfromX24m     Specifies the distance that the left edge of
	  4mfromPos24m is from the left edge of the window.  This
	  is the reference x location for the reference
	  position.

4mwidth24m     Specifies the distance, in pixels, from the refer-
	  ence position to the desired character position.

4mpos_return0m
	  Returns the character position that corresponds to
	  the location that has been specified, or the word
	  break immediately to the left if 4mstopAtWordBreak0m
	  is 1mTrue22m.

This function need make no attempt to deal with line feeds.
The text widget will only call it one line at a time.  This
is a more convenient interface to the 1mFindPosition 22mfunction,
and provides a subset of its functionality.

1m5.11.2.5.  Finding the Distance Between two Text Positions0m

To find the distance in pixels between two text positions on
the same line use the function 1mFindDistance22m.

void FindDistance(4mw24m, 4mfromPos24m, 4mfromX24m, 4mtoPos24m, 4mwidth_return24m, 4mpos_return24m, 4mheight_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XawTextPosition 4mfromPos24m, 4mtoPos24m;
      int 4mfromX24m;
      XawTextPosition 4m*pos_return24m;
      int 4m*width_return24m, 4m*height_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mfromPos24m   Specifies the text buffer position, in characters,
	  of the first position.

4mfromX24m     Specifies the distance that the left edge of
	  4mfromPos24m is from the left edge of the window.  This
	  is the reference x location for the reference
	  position.



			     1m1630m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mtoPos24m     Specifies the text buffer position, in characters,
	  of the second position.

4mresWidth24m  Return the actual distance between 4mfromPos24m and
	  4mpos_return.0m

4mresPos24m    Returns the character position that corresponds to
	  the actual character position used for 4mtoPos24m in
	  the calculations.  This may be different than
	  4mtoPos24m, for example if 4mfromPos24m and 4mtoPos24m are on
	  different lines in the file.

4mheight_return0m
	  Returns the maximum height of the text between
	  4mfromPos24m and 4mpos_return24m.

This function need make no attempt to deal with line feeds.
The Text widget will only call it one line at a time.

1m5.11.2.6.  Finding the Size of the Drawing area0m

To find the maximum number of lines that will fit into the
current Text widget, use the function 1mMaxLines22m.  The
TextSink already defines this function to compute the maxi-
mum number of lines by using the height of 1mfont22m.

int MaxLines(4mw24m, 4mheight24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Dimension 4mheight24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mheight24m    Specifies the height of the current drawing area.

Returns the maximum number of lines that will fit in 4mheight24m.


To find the height required for a given number of text
lines, use the function 1mMaxHeight22m.	 The TextSink already
defines this function to compute the maximum height of the
window by using the height of 1mfont22m.

int MaxHeight(4mw24m, 4mlines24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      int 4mlines24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mheight24m    Specifies the height of the current drawing area.

Returns the height that will be taken up by the number of
lines passed.



			     1m1640m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1m5.11.2.7.  Setting the Tab Stops0m

To set the tab stops for a text sink use the 1mSetTabs 22mfunc-
tion.  The TextSink already defines this function to set the
tab x location in pixels to be the number of characters
times the figure width of 1mfont22m.

void SetTabs(4mw24m, 4mtab_count24m, 4mtabs24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      int 4mtab_count24m, 4m*tabs24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSink object.

4mtab_count24m Specifies the number of tabs passed in 4mtabs24m.

4mtabs24m      Specifies the position, in characters, of the tab
	  stops.

This function is responsible for the converting character
positions passed to it into whatever internal positions the
TextSink uses for tab placement.

1m5.11.2.8.  Getting the Insert Point's Size and Location0m

To get the size and location of the insert point use the
1mGetCursorBounds 22mfunction.

void GetCursorBounds(4mw24m, 4mrect_return24m)
Widget 4mw24m;
XRectangle 4m*rect_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the TextSinkObject.

4mrect_return0m
	  Returns the location and size of the insert point.

4mRect24m will be filled with the current size and location of
the insert point.

			 1mChapter 60m

	      1mComposite and Constraint Widgets0m




These widgets may contain arbitrary widget children.  They
implement a policy for the size and location of their chil-
dren.

1mBox	    22mThis widget will pack its children as tightly as
	  possible in non-overlapping rows.

1mDialog    22mAn implementation of a commonly used interaction
	  semantic to prompt for auxiliary input from the
	  user, such as a filename.

1mForm	    22mA more sophisticated layout widget that allows the
	  children to specify their positions relative to
	  the other children, or to the edges of the Form.

1mPaned	    22mAllows children to be tiled vertically or horizon-
	  tally.  Controls are also provided to allow the
	  user to dynamically resize the individual panes.

1mPorthole  22mAllows viewing of a managed child which is as
	  large as, or larger than its parent, typically
	  under control of a Panner widget.

1mTree	    22mProvides geometry management of widgets arranged
	  in a directed, acyclic graph.

1mViewport  22mConsists of a frame, one or two scrollbars, and an
	  inner window.	 The inner window can contain all
	  the data that is to be displayed.  This inner win-
	  dow will be clipped by the frame with the scroll-
	  bars controlling which section of the inner window
	  is currently visible.


1m6.0.1.  A Brief Note on Geometry Management0m

The geometry management semantics provided by the X Toolkit
give full control of the size and position of a widget to
the parent of that widget.  While the children are allowed
to request a certain size or location, it is the parent who
makes the final decision.  Many of the composite widgets
here will deny any geometry request from their children by
default.  If a child widget is not getting the expected size
or location, it is most likely the parent disallowing a
request, or implementing semantics slightly different than



			     1m1660m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


those expected by the application programmer.

If the application wishes to change the size or location of
any widget it should make a call to 1mXtSetValues22m.  This will
allow the widget to ask its parent for the new size or loca-
tion.  As noted above the parent is allowed to refuse this
request, and the child must live with the result.  If the
application is unable to achieve the desired semantics, then
perhaps it should use a different composite widget.  Under
no circumstances should an application programmer resort to
1mXtMoveWidget 22mor 1mXtResizeWidget22m; these functions are exclu-
sively for the use of Composite widget implementors.

The Box widget provides geometry management of arbitrary
widgets in a box of a specified dimension.  The children are
rearranged when resizing events occur either on the Box or
its children, or when children are managed or unmanaged.
The Box widget always attempts to pack its children as
tightly as possible within the geometry allowed by its par-
ent.

Box widgets are commonly used to manage a related set of
buttons and are often called ButtonBox widgets, but the
children are not limited to buttons.  The Box's children are
arranged on a background that has its own specified dimen-
sions and color.

1m6.1.2.  Layout Semantics0m

Each time a child is managed or unmanaged, the Box widget
will attempt to reposition the remaining children to compact
the box.  Children are positioned in order left to right,
top to bottom.	The packing algorithm used depends on the
1morientation 22mof the Box.

1mXtorientVertical0m
	       When the next child does not fit on the cur-
	       rent row, a new row is started.	If a child
	       is wider than the width of the box, the box
	       will request a larger width from its parent
	       and will begin the layout process from the
	       beginning if a new width is granted.

1mXtorientHorizontal0m
	       When the next child does not fit on the cur-
	       rent row, the Box widens if possible (so as
	       to keep children on a single row); otherwise
	       a new row is started.

After positioning all children, the Box widget attempts to
shrink its own size to the minimum dimensions required for
the layout.

The Dialog widget implements a commonly used interaction
semantic to prompt for auxiliary input from a user.  For
example, you can use a Dialog widget when an application
requires a small piece of information, such as a filename,
from the user.	A Dialog widget, which is simply a special
case of the Form widget, provides a convenient way to create
a preconfigured form.

The typical Dialog widget contains three areas.	 The first
line contains a description of the function of the Dialog
widget, for example, the string 4mFilename:24m.	 The second line
contains an area into which the user types input.  The third
line can contain buttons that let the user confirm or cancel
the Dialog input.  Any of these areas may be omitted by the
application.

	       widget will ignore all geometry request made
	       by this child.  The parent may still resize
	       this child itself, however.

1m6.2.3.  Layout Semantics0m

The Dialog widget uses two different sets of layout seman-
tics.  One is used when initially laying out the children.
The other is used when the Dialog is resized.

The first layout method uses the 1mfromVert 22mand 1mfromHoriz0m
resources to place the children of the Dialog.	A single
pass is made through the Dialog widget's children in the
order that they were created.  Each child is then placed in
the Dialog widget below or to the right of the widget speci-
fied by the 1mfromVert 22mand 1mfromHoriz 22mresources.	 The distance
the new child is placed from its left or upper neighbor is
determined by the 1mhorizDistance 22mand 1mvertDistance 22mresources.
This implies some things about how the order of creation
affects the possible placement of the children.	 The Form
widget registers a string to widget converter which does not
postpone conversion and does not cache conversion results.




			     1m1740m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The second layout method is used when the Dialog is resized.
It does not matter what causes this resize, and it is possi-
ble for a resize to happen before the widget becomes visible
(due to constraints imposed by the parent of the Dialog).
This layout method uses the 1mbottom22m, 1mtop22m, 1mleft22m, and 1mright0m
resources.  These resources are used to determine what will
happen to each edge of the child when the Dialog is resized.
If a value of 1mXawChain4m22m<something>24m is specified, the the edge
of the child will remain a fixed distance from the 4mchain0m
edge of the Dialog.  For example if 1mXawChainLeft 22mis speci-
fied for the 1mright 22mresource of a child then the right edge
of that child will remain a fixed distance from the left
edge of the Dialog widget.  If a value of 1mXawRubber 22mis spec-
ified, that edge will grow by the same percentage that the
Dialog grew.  For instance if the Dialog grows by 50% the
left edge of the child (if specified as 1mXawRubber 22mwill be
50% farther from the left edge of the Dialog).	One must be
very careful when specifying these resources, for when they
are specified incorrectly children may overlap or completely
occlude other children when the Dialog widget is resized.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mEdge Type	    Resource Name   Description0m
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XawChainBottom	  ChainBottom	  Edge remains a fixed distance from bottom of Dialog
XawChainLeft	  ChainLeft	  Edge remains a fixed distance from left of Dialog
XawChainRight	  ChainRight	  Edge remains a fixed distance from right of Dialog
XawChainTop	  ChainTop	  Edge remains a fixed distance from top of Dialog
XawRubber	  Rubber	  Edges will move a proportional distance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1m6.2.3.1.  Example0m

If you wish to force the Dialog to never resize one or more
of its children then set 1mleft 22mand 1mright 22mto 1mXawChainLeft 22mand
1mtop 22mand 1mbottom 22mto 1mXawChainTop22m.  This will cause the child to
remain a fixed distance from the top and left edges of the
Dialog, and to never resize.

1m6.2.3.2.  Special Considerations0m

The Dialog widget automatically sets the 1mtop 22mand 1mbottom0m
resources for all Children that are subclasses of the Com-
mand widget, as well as the widget children that are used to
contain the 1mlabel22m, 1mvalue22m, and 1micon22m.  This policy allows the
buttons at the bottom of the Dialog to interact correctly
with the predefined children, and makes it possible for a
client to simply create and manage a new Command button
without having to specify its constraints.

The Dialog will also set 1mfromLeft 22mto the last button in the
Dialog for each new button added to the Dialog widget.



			     1m1750m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The automatically added constraints cannot be overridden, as
they are policy decisions of the Dialog widget.	 If a more
flexible Dialog is desired, the application is free to use
the Form widget to create its own Dialog policy.

1m6.2.4.  Automatically Created Children.0m

The Dialog uses Label widgets to contain the 1mlabel 22mand 1micon22m.
These widgets are named 4mlabel24m and 4micon24m respectively.	The
Dialog 1mvalue 22mis contained in an AsciiText widget whose name
is 4mvalue24m.	Using 1mXtNameToWidget 22mthe application can change
those resources associated with each of these widgets that
are not available through the Dialog widget itself.


1m6.2.5.  Convenience Routines0m

To return the character string in the text field, use 4mXawDi-0m
4malogGetValueString24m.

String XawDialogGetValueString(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Dialog widget.

This function returns a copy of the value string of the Dia-
log widget.  This string is allocated by the AsciiText wid-
get and will remain valid and unchanged until another call
to 1mXawDialogGetValueString 22mor an 1mXtGetValues 22mcall on the
1mvalue 22mwidget, when the string will be automatically freed,
and a new string is returned.  This string may be freed ear-
lier by calling the function 1mXawAsciiSourceFreeString22m.


To add a new button to the Dialog widget use 1mXawDialogAd-0m
1mdButton22m.

void XawDialogAddButton(4mw24m, 4mname24m, 4mfunc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     String 4mname24m;
     XtCallbackProc 4mfunc24m;
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Dialog widget.

4mname24m      Specifies the name of the new Command button to be
	  added to the Dialog.

4mfunc24m      Specifies a callback function to be called when
	  this button is activated.  If NULL is specified
	  then no callback is added.




			     1m1760m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client_data to be passed to the
	  4mfunc24m.

This function is merely a shorthand for the code sequence:


{
	  Widget button = XtCreateManagedWidget(name, commandWidgetClass, w, NULL, ZERO);
	  XtAddCallback(button, XtNcallback, func, client_data);
}

Class		    formWidgetClass
Class Name	    Form
Superclass	    Constraint



The Form widget can contain an arbitrary number of children
or subwidgets.	The Form provides geometry management for
its children, which allows individual control of the posi-
tion of each child.  Any combination of children can be
added to a Form.  The initial positions of the children may
be computed relative to the positions of previously created
children.  When the Form is resized, it computes new posi-
tions and sizes for its children.  This computation is based
upon information provided when a child is added to the Form.

The default width of the Form is the minimum width needed to
enclose the children after computing their initial layout,
with a margin of 1mdefaultDistance 22mat the right and bottom
edges.	If a width and height is assigned to the Form that
is too small for the layout, the children will be clipped by
the right and bottom edges of the Form.

1m6.3.1.  Resources0m

When creating a Form widget instance, the following
resources are retrieved from the argument list or from the

1m6.3.2.  Constraint Resources0m

Each child of the Form widget may request special layout
resources be applied to it.  These 4mconstraint24m resources
allow the Form widget's children to specify individual lay-
out requirements.

	       details.

1mfromHoriz0m
1mfromVert	 22mWhich widget this child should be placed
	       underneath (or to the right of).	 If a value
	       of NULL is specified then this widget will be
	       positioned relative to the edge of the par-
	       ent.

1mhorizDistance0m
1mvertDistance	 22mThe amount of space, in pixels, between this
	       child and its left or upper neighbor.

1mresizable	 22mIf this resource is 1mFalse 22mthen the parent
	       widget will ignore all geometry request made
	       by this child.  The parent may still resize
	       this child itself, however.

1m6.3.3.  Layout Semantics0m

The Form widget uses two different sets of layout semantics.
One is used when initially laying out the children.  The
other is used when the Form is resized.




			     1m1800m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The first layout method uses the 1mfromVert 22mand 1mfromHoriz0m
resources to place the children of the Form.  A single pass
is made through the Form widget's children in the order that
they were created.  Each child is then placed in the Form
widget below or to the right of the widget specified by the
1mfromVert 22mand 1mfromHoriz 22mresources.  The distance the new
child is placed from its left or upper neighbor is deter-
mined by the 1mhorizDistance 22mand 1mvertDistance 22mresources.  This
implies some things about how the order of creation affects
the possible placement of the children.	 The Form widget
registers a string to widget converter which does not post-
pone conversion and does not cache conversion results.

The second layout method is used when the Form is resized.
It does not matter what causes this resize, and it is possi-
ble for a resize to happen before the widget becomes visible
(due to constraints imposed by the parent of the Form).
This layout method uses the 1mbottom22m, 1mtop22m, 1mleft22m, and 1mright0m
resources.  These resources are used to determine what will
happen to each edge of the child when the Form is resized.
If a value of 1mXawChain4m22m<something>24m is specified, the the edge
of the child will remain a fixed distance from the 4mchain0m
edge of the Form.  For example if 1mXawChainLeft 22mis specified
for the 1mright 22mresource of a child then the right edge of
that child will remain a fixed distance from the left edge
of the Form widget.  If a value of 1mXawRubber 22mis specified,
that edge will grow by the same percentage that the Form
grew.  For instance if the Form grows by 50% the left edge
of the child (if specified as 1mXawRubber 22mwill be 50% farther
from the left edge of the Form).  One must be very careful
when specifying these resources, for when they are specified
incorrectly children may overlap or completely occlude other
children when the Form widget is resized.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1mEdge Type	    Resource Name   Description0m
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XawChainBottom	  ChainBottom	  Edge remains a fixed distance from bottom of Form
XawChainLeft	  ChainLeft	  Edge remains a fixed distance from left of Form
XawChainRight	  ChainRight	  Edge remains a fixed distance from right of Form
XawChainTop	  ChainTop	  Edge remains a fixed distance from top of Form
XawRubber	  Rubber	  Edges will move a proportional distance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1m6.3.3.1.  Example0m

If you wish to force the Form to never resize one or more of
its children, then set 1mleft 22mand 1mright 22mto 1mXawChainLeft 22mand
1mtop 22mand 1mbottom 22mto 1mXawChainTop22m.  This will cause the child to
remain a fixed distance from the top and left edges of the
Form, and never to resize.




			     1m1810m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


1m6.3.4.  Convenience Routines0m

To force or defer a re-layout of the Form, use 4mXawFormDoLay-0m
4mout24m.

void XawFormDoLayout(4mw24m, 4mdo_layout24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     Boolean 4mdo_layout24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Form widget.

4mdo_layout24m Specifies whether the layout of the Form widget is
	  enabled (1mTrue22m) or disabled (1mFalse22m).

When making several changes to the children of a Form widget
after the Form has been realized, it is a good idea to dis-
able relayout until after all changes have been made.


1m6.4.	Paned Widget0m



Application Header file<X11/Xaw/Paned.h>
Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/PanedP.h>
Class		    panedWidgetClass
Class Name	    Paned
Superclass	    Constraint



The Paned widget manages children in a vertically or hori-
zontally tiled fashion.	 The panes may be dynamically
resized by the user by using the 4mgrips24m that appear near the
right or bottom edge of the border between two panes.

The Paned widget may accept any widget class as a pane
1mexcept 22mGrip.  Grip widgets have a special meaning for the
Paned widget, and adding a Grip as its own pane will confuse
the Paned widget.

1m6.4.1.  Using the Paned Widget0m

The grips allow the panes to be resized by the user.  The
semantics of how these panes resize is somewhat complicated,
and warrants further explanation here.	When the mouse
pointer is positioned on a grip and pressed, an arrow is
displayed that indicates the pane that is to be to be
resized.  While keeping the mouse button down, the user can
move the grip up and down (or left and right).	This, in
turn, changes the size of the pane.  The size of the Paned
widget will not change.	  Instead, it chooses another pane
(or panes) to resize. For more details on which pane it



			     1m1820m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


chooses to resize, see 1mLayout Semantics22m.

One pointer binding allows the border between two panes to
be moved, without affecting any of the other panes.  When
this occurs the pointer will change to an arrow that points
along the pane border.

The default bindings for the Paned widget's grips are:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1mMouse button	 Pane to Resize - Vertical   Pane to Resize - Horizontal0m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 (left)       above the grip		   left of the grip
2 (middle)     adjust border		   adjust border
3 (right)      below the grip		   right of the grip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	       window will automatically be mapped by the
	       Toolkit when it is realized and managed.

numChildren    The number of children in this composite wid-
	       get.  This is not the same as the number of
	       panes, since this also contains a grip for
	       some of the panes, use 1mXawPanedGetNumSub 22mto
	       retrieve the number of panes.

1morientation	 22mThe orientation to stack the panes.	 This
	       value can be either 1mXtorientVertical 22mor 1mXto-0m

1mallowResize	 22mIf this value is 1mFalse 22mthe the Paned widget
	       will disallow all geometry requests from this
	       child.

1mmax0m
1mmin		 22mThe absolute maximum or minimum size for this
	       pane.  These values will never be overridden
	       by the Paned widget.  This may cause some
	       panes to be pushed off the bottom (or right)
	       edge of the paned widget.

1mpreferredPaneSize0m
	       Normally the paned widget makes a QueryGeome-
	       try call on a child to determine the pre-
	       ferred size of the child's pane.	 There are
	       times when the application programmer or the
	       user has a better idea of the preferred size
	       of a pane.  Setting this resource causes the
	       value passed to be interpreted as the pre-
	       ferred size, in pixels, of this pane.

1mresizeToPreferred0m
	       Determines whether or not to resize each pane
	       to its preferred size when the Paned widget

	       pane.  The grip associated with a pane is
	       either below or to the right of the pane.  No
	       grip is ever shown for the last pane.

1mskipAdjust	 22mThis resource is used to determine which pane
	       is forced to be resized.	 Setting this value
	       to 1mTrue 22mmakes this pane less likely to be
	       forced to be resized.  See 1mLayout Semantics0m
	       for details.

1m6.4.4.  Layout Semantics0m

In order to make effective use of the Paned widget it is
helpful to know the rules it uses to determine which child
will be resized in any given situation.	 There are three
rules used to determine which child is resized.	 While these
rules are always the same, the panes that are searched can
change depending upon what caused the relayout.


1mLayout Rules0m

1m1    22mDo not let a pane grow larger than its 1mmax 22mor smaller
     than its 1mmin22m.

1m2    22mDo not adjust panes with 1mskipAdjust 22mset.

1m3    22mDo not adjust panes away from their preferred size,
     although moving one closer to its preferred size is
     fine.

When searching the children the Paned widget looks for panes
that satisfy all the rules, and if unsuccessful then it
eliminates rule 3 and then 2.  Rule 1 is always enforced.

If the relayout is due to a resize or change in management
then the panes are searched from bottom to top.	 If the
relayout is due to grip movement then they are searched from
the grip selected in the direction opposite the pane
selected.

1m6.4.4.1.  Resizing Panes from a Grip Action0m

The pane above the grip is resized by invoking the Gri-
pAction with 1mUpLeftPane 22mspecified.	 The panes below the grip
are each checked against all rules, then rules 2 and 1 and
finally against rule 1 only.  No pane above the chosen pane
will ever be resized.





			     1m1880m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


The pane below the grip is resized by invoking the Gri-
pAction with 1mLowRightPane 22mspecified.  The panes above the
grip are each checked in this case.  No pane below the cho-
sen pane will ever be resized.

Invoking GripAction with 1mThisBorderOnly 22mspecified just moves
the border between the panes.  No other panes are ever
resized.

1m6.4.4.2.  Resizing Panes after the Paned widget is resized.0m

When the Pane widget is resized it must determine a new size
for each pane.	There are two methods of doing this.  The
Paned widget can either give each pane its preferred size
and then resize the panes to fit, or it can use the current
sizes and then resize the panes to fit.	 The 1mresizeToPre-0m
1mferred 22mresource allows the application to tell the Paned
widget whether to query the child about its preferred size
(subject to the the 1mpreferredPaneSize22m) or to use the current
size when refiguring the pane locations after the pane has
been resized.

There is one special case.  All panes assume they should
resize to their preferred size until the Paned widget
becomes visible to the user.

1m6.4.4.3.  Managing Children and Geometry Management0m

The Paned widget always resizes its children to their pre-
ferred sizes when a new child is managed, or a geometry man-
agement request is honored.  The Paned widget will first
attempt to resize itself to contain its panes exactly.	If
this is not possible then it will hunt through the children,
from bottom to top (right to left), for a pane to resize.

1m6.4.4.4.  Special Considerations0m

When a user resizes a pane with the grips, the Paned widget
assumes that this new size is the preferred size of the
pane.

1m6.4.5.  Grip Translations0m

The Paned widget has no action routines of its own, as all
actions are handled through the grips.	The grips are each
assigned a default Translation table.



     <Btn1Down>:      GripAction(Start, UpLeftPane)
     <Btn2Down>:      GripAction(Start, ThisBorderOnly)
     <Btn3Down>:      GripAction(Start, LowRightPane)
     <Btn1Motion>:    GripAction(Move, UpLeftPane)
     <Btn2Motion>:    GripAction(Move, ThisBorderOnly)



			     1m1890m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


     <Btn3Motion>:    GripAction(Move, LowRightPane)
     Any<BtnUp>:      GripAction(Commit)



The Paned widget interprets the 1mGripAction 22mas taking two
arguments.  The first argument may be any of the following:

1mStart	    22mSets up the Paned widget for resizing and changes
	  the cursor of the grip.  The second argument
	  determines which pane will be resized, and can
	  take on any of the three values shown above.

1mMove	    22mThe internal borders are drawn over the current
	  pane locations to animate where the borders would
	  actually be placed if you were to move this border
	  as shown.  The second argument must match the sec-
	  ond argument that was passed to the 1mStart 22maction,
	  that began this process.  If these arguments are
	  not passed, the behavior is undefined.

1mCommit    22mThis argument causes the Paned widget to commit
	  the changes selected by the previously started
	  action.  The cursor is changed back to the grip's
	  inactive cursor.  No second argument is needed in
	  this case.

1m6.4.6.  Convenience Routines0m

To enable or disable a child's request for pane resizing,
use 4mXawPanedAllowResize24m:

void XawPanedAllowResize(4mw24m, 4mallow_resize24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     Boolean 4mallow_resize24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the child pane.

4mallow_resize0m
	  Specifies whether or not resizing requests for
	  this child will be granted by the Paned widget.

If allow_resize is 1mTrue22m, the Paned widget allows geometry
requests from the child to change the pane's height. If
allow_resize is 1mFalse22m, the Paned widget ignores geometry
requests from the child to change the pane's height. The
default state is 1mTrue 22mbefore the Pane is realized and 1mFalse0m
after it is realized.  This procedure is equivalent to
changing the 1mallowResize 22mconstraint resource for the child.


To change the minimum and maximum height settings for a
pane, use 4mXawPanedSetMinMax24m:



			     1m1900m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


void XawPanedSetMinMax(4mw24m, 4mmin24m, 4mmax24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     int 4mmin24m, 4mmax24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the child pane.

4mmin24m       Specifies the new minimum height of the child,
	  expressed in pixels.

4mmax24m       Specifies new maximum height of the child,
	  expressed in pixels.

This procedure is equivalent to setting the 1mmin 22mand 1mmax 22mcon-
straint resources for the child.


To retrieve the minimum and maximum height settings for a
pane, use 4mXawPanedGetMinMax24m:

void XawPanedGetMinMax(4mw24m, 4mmin_return24m, 4mmax_return24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     int 4m*min_return24m, 4m*max_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the child pane.

4mmin_return0m
	  Returns the minimum height of the child, expressed
	  in pixels.

4mmax_return0m
	  Returns the maximum height of the child, expressed
	  in pixels.

This procedure is equivalent to getting the 1mmin 22mand 1mmax0m
resources for this child child.


To enable or disable automatic recalculation of pane sizes
and positions, use 4mXawPanedSetRefigureMode24m:

void XawPanedSetRefigureMode(4mw24m, 4mmode24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     Boolean 4mmode24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Paned widget.

4mmode24m      Specifies whether the layout of the Paned widget
	  is enabled (1mTrue22m) or disabled (1mFalse22m).

When making several changes to the children of a Paned wid-
get after the Paned has been realized, it is a good idea to



			     1m1910m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


disable relayout until after all changes have been made.


To retrieve the number of panes in a paned widget use 1mXaw-0m
1mPanedGetNumSub22m:

int XawPanedGetNumSub(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the Paned widget.

This function returns the number of panes in the Paned wid-
get.  This is 1mnot 22mthe same as the number of children, since
the grips are also children of the Paned widget.

The Porthole widget allows its managed child to request any
size that is as large or larger than the Porthole itself and
any location so long as the child still obscures all of the
Porthole.  This widget typically is used with a Panner wid-
get.

1m6.5.3.  Porthole Callbacks0m

The functions registered on the 1mreportCallback 22mlist are
invoked whenever the managed child changes size or position:

Class		    treeWidgetClass
Class Name	    Tree
Superclass	    Constraint



The Tree widget provides geometry management of arbitrary
widgets arranged in a directed, acyclic graph (i.e., a
tree).	The hierarchy is constructed by attaching a con-
straint resource called 1mtreeParent 22mto each widget indicating
which other node in the tree should be treated as the wid-
get's superior.	 The structure of the tree is shown by lay-
ing out the nodes in the standard format for tree diagrams
with lines drawn connecting each node with its children.

The Tree sizes itself according to the needs of its children
and is not intended to be resized by its parent.  Instead,
it should be placed inside another composite widget (such as
the 1mPorthole 22mor 1mViewport22m) that can be used to scroll around
in the tree.

1m6.6.1.  Resources0m

When creating a Tree widget instance, the following

	       1mWestGravity22m, 1mNorthGravity22m, 1mEastGravity22m, and
	       1mSouthGravity22m.  A converter is registered for
	       this resource that will convert the following
	       strings:	 the legal values.

1m6.6.2.  Constraint Resources0m

Each child of the Tree widget must specify its superior node
in the tree.  In addition, it may specify a GC to use when
drawing a line between it and its inferior nodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName	       Class	    Type	 Notes	 Default Value0m

--------------------------------------------------------------------


1mtreeGC	 22mThis specifies the GC to use when drawing
	       lines between this widget and its inferiors
	       in the tree.  If this resource is not speci-
	       fied, the Tree's 1mforeground 22mand 1mlineWidth0m
	       will be used.

1mtreeParent	 22mThis specifies the superior node in the tree
	       for this widget.	 The default is for the node
	       to have no superior (and to therefore be at
	       the top of the tree).

1m6.6.3.  Layout Semantics0m

Each time a child is managed or unmanaged, the Tree widget
will attempt to reposition the remaining children to fix the
shape of the tree if the 1mautoReconfigure 22mresource is set.
Children at the top (most superior) of the tree are drawn at
the side specified by the 1mgravity 22mresource.

After positioning all children, the Tree widget attempts to
shrink its own size to the minimum dimensions required for
the layout.

1m6.6.4.  Convenience Routines0m

The most efficient way to layout a tree is to set 1mautoRecon-0m
1mfigure 22mto False and then use the 1mXawTreeForceLayout 22mroutine
to arrange the children.

Class Header file   <X11/Xaw/ViewportP.h>
Class		    viewportWidgetClass
Class Name	    Viewport
Superclass	    Form



The Viewport widget consists of a frame window, one or two
Scrollbars, and an inner window.  The size of the frame win-
dow is determined by the viewing size of the data that is to
be displayed and the dimensions to which the Viewport is
created.  The inner window is the full size of the data that
is to be displayed and is clipped by the frame window.	The
Viewport widget controls the scrolling of the data directly.
No application callbacks are required for scrolling.

When the geometry of the frame window is equal in size to
the inner window, or when the data does not require
scrolling, the Viewport widget automatically removes any
scrollbars.  The 1mforceBars 22moption causes the Viewport widget
to display all scrollbars permanently.

1m6.7.2.  Layout Semantics0m

The Viewport widget manages a single child widget.  When the
size of the child is larger than the size of the Viewport,
the user can interactively move the child within the View-
port by repositioning the scrollbars.

The default size of the Viewport before it is realized is
the width and/or height of the child.  After it is realized,
the Viewport will allow its child to grow vertically or hor-
izontally if 1mallowVert 22mor 1mallowHoriz 22mare set, respectively.
If the corresponding vertical or horizontal scrollbar is not
enabled, the Viewport will propagate the geometry request to
its own parent and the child will be allowed to change size
only if the Viewport's parent allows it.  Regardless of
whether or not scrollbars are enabled in the corresponding
direction, if the child requests a new size smaller than the
Viewport size, the change will be allowed only if the parent
of the Viewport allows the Viewport to shrink to the appro-
priate dimension.

The scrollbar children of the Viewport are named 1mhorizontal0m
and 1mvertical22m.  By using these names the programmer can spec-
ify resources for the individual scrollbars.  1mXtSetValues0m
can be used to modify the resources dynamically once the
widget ID has been obtained with 1mXtNameToWidget22m.

			    Note

     Although the Viewport is a Subclass of the Form,
     no resources for the Form may be supplied for any
     of the children of the Viewport.  These con-
     straints are managed internally and are not meant
     for public consumption.

	     1mCreating New Widgets (Subclassing)0m

		  Written By: Ralph Swick




Although the task of creating a new widget may at first
appear a little daunting, there is a basic simple pattern
that all widgets follow.  The Athena Widget library contains
a special widget called the 4mTemplate24m widget that is intended
to assist the novice widget programmer in writing a custom
widget.

Reasons for wishing to write a custom widget include:

  Providing a graphical interface not currently supported
   by any existing widget set.

  Convenient access to resource management procedures to
   obtain fonts, colors, etc., even if user customization is
   not desired.

  Convenient access to user input dispatch and translation
   management procedures.

  Access to callback mechanism for building higher-level
   application libraries.

  Customizing the interface or behavior of an existing wid-
   get to suit a special application need.

  Desire to allow user customization of resources such as
   fonts, colors, etc., or to allow convenient re-binding of
   keys and buttons to internal functions.

  Converting a non-Toolkit application to use the Toolkit.

In each of these cases, the operation needed to create a new
widget is to "subclass" an existing one.  If the desired
semantics of the new widget are similar to an existing one,
then the implementation of the existing widget should be
examined to see how much work would be required to create a
subclass that will then be able to share the existing class
methods.  Much time will be saved in writing the new widget
if an existing widget class Expose, Resize and/or Geometry-
Manager method can be used by the subclass.

Note that some trivial uses of a ``bare-bones'' widget may
be achieved by simply creating an instance of the Core



			     1m2030m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


widget.	 The class variable to use when creating a Core wid-
get is 4mwidgetClass24m.  The geometry of the Core widget is
determined entirely by the parent widget.

It is very often the case than an application will have a
special need for a certain set of functions and that many
copies of these functions will be needed.  For example, when
converting an older application to use the Toolkit, it may
be desirable to have a "Window Widget" class that might have
the following semantics:

  Allocate 2 drawing colors in addition to a background
   color.

  Allocate a text font.

  Execute an application-supplied function to handle expo-
   sure events.

  Execute an application-supplied function to handle user
   input events.

It is obvious that a completely general-purpose WindowWid-
getClass could be constructed that would export all class
methods as callbacks lists, but such a widget would be very
large and would have to choose some arbitrary number of
resources such as colors to allocate.  An application that
used many instances of the general-purpose widget would
therefore un-necessarily waste many resources.


In this section, an outline will be given of the procedure
to follow to construct a special-purpose widget to address
the items listed above.	 The reader should refer to the
appropriate sections of the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLan-0m
4mguage24m 4mInterface24m for complete details of the material out-
lined here.  Section 1.4 of the 4mIntrinsics24m should be read in
conjunction with this section.

All Athena widgets have three separate files associated with
them:


  A "public" header file containing declarations needed by
   applications programmers

  A "private" header file containing additional declara-
   tions needed by the widget and any subclasses

  A source code file containing the implementation of the
   widget

This separation of functions into three files is suggested
for all widgets, but nothing in the Toolkit actually



			     1m2040m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


requires this format.  In particular, a private widget cre-
ated for a single application may easily combine the "pub-
lic" and "private" header files into a single file, or merge
the contents into another application header file.  Simi-
larly, the widget implementation can be merged into other
application code.


In the following example, the public header file
<4mX11/Xaw/Template.h24m>, the private header file <4mX11/Xaw/Tem-0m
4mplateP.h24m> and the source code file <4mX11/Xaw/Template.c24m> will
be modified to produce the "WindowWidget" described above.
In each case, the files have been designed so that a global
string replacement of ``Template'' and ``template'' with the
name of your new widget, using the appropriate case, can be
done.

1m7.1.	Public Header File0m

The public header file contains declarations that will be
required by any application module that needs to refer to
the widget; whether to create an instance of the class, to
perform an 4mXtSetValues24m operation, or to call a public rou-
tine implemented by the widget class.

The contents of the Template public header file,
<4mX11/Xaw/Template.h24m>, are:

For the "WindowWidget", we want 2 drawing colors, a callback
list for user input and an 1mexposeCallback 22mcallback list, and
we will declare three convenience procedures, so we need to
add




  /* Resources:
    ...
   callback	Callback  Callback   NULL
   drawingColor1	  Color	     PixelXtDefaultForeground
   drawingColor2	  Color	     PixelXtDefaultForeground
   exposeCallback	  Callback   CallbackNULL

  #define XtNdrawingColor1 "drawingColor1"
  #define XtNdrawingColor2 "drawingColor2"
  #define XtNexposeCallback "exposeCallback"

  extern Pixel WindowColor1(/* Widget */);
  extern Pixel WindowColor2(/* Widget */);
  extern Font  WindowFont(/* Widget */);


Note that we have chosen to call the input callback list by
the generic name, 1mcallback22m, rather than a specific name.  If
widgets that define a single user-input action all choose
the same resource name then there is greater possibility for
an application to switch between widgets of different types.

1m7.2.	Private Header File0m

The private header file contains the complete declaration of
the class and instance structures for the widget and any
additional private data that will be required by anticipated
subclasses of the widget.  Information in the private header
file is normally hidden from the application and is designed
to be accessed only through other public procedures; e.g.
4mXtSetValues24m.

The private header file includes the private header file of
its superclass, thereby exposing the entire internal struc-
ture of the widget.  It may not always be advantageous to do
this; your own project development style will dictate the
appropriate level of detail to expose in each module.

The "WindowWidget" needs to declare two fields in its
instance structure to hold the drawing colors, a resource
field for the font and a field for the expose and user input
callback lists:


  typedef struct {
    /* resources */
    Pixel color_1;
    Pixel color_2;
    XFontStruct* font;
    XtCallbackList expose_callback;
    XtCallbackList input_callback;
    /* private state */
    /* (none) */
  } WindowPart;


1m7.3.	Widget Source File0m

The source code file implements the widget class itself.
The unique part of this file is the declaration and initial-
ization of the widget class record structure and the decla-
ration of all resources and action routines added by the
widget class.

    { XtNcallback, XtCCallback, XtRCallback, sizeof(XtCallbackList),
		  offset(input_callback), XtRCallback, NULL },
  #undef offset
  };


The user input callback will be implemented by an action
procedure which passes the event pointer as call_data.	The
action procedure is declared as:


  /* ARGSUSED */
  static void InputAction(w, event, params, num_params)
    Widget w;
    XEvent *event;
    String *params;	     /* unused */

  }

    {"input",	InputAction},
  };



			     1m2120m





1mAthena Widget Set			      X11, Release 6.40m


and the default input binding will be to execute the input
callbacks on 4mKeyPress24m and 4mButtonPress24m:



  static char translations[] =
  " <Key>:	input() \n\
    <BtnDown>:	input() \
  ";


In the class record declaration and initialization, the only
field that is different from the Template is the expose pro-
cedure:

The "WindowWidget" will also declare three public procedures
to return the drawing colors and the font id, saving the
application the effort of constructing an argument list for
a call to 4mXtGetValues24m:



  Pixel WindowColor1(w)
    Widget w;
  {
    return ((WindowWidget)w)->window.color_1;
  }

  Pixel WindowColor2(w)
    Widget w;
  {
    return ((WindowWidget)w)->window.color_2;
  }

  Font WindowFont(w)
    Widget w;

  {
    return ((WindowWidget)w)->window.font->fid;
  }


The "WindowWidget" is now complete.  The application can
retrieve the two drawing colors from the widget instance by
calling either 4mXtGetValues24m, or the 1mWindowColor 22mfunctions.
The actual window created for the "WindowWidget" is avail-
able by calling the 4mXtWindow24m function.
