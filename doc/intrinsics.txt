The design of the X11 Intrinsics was done primarily by Joel
McCormack of Digital WSL.  Major contributions to the design
and implementation also were done by Charles Haynes, Mike
Chow, and Paul Asente of Digital WSL.  Additional contribu-
tors to the design and/or implementation were:


     Loretta Guarino-Reid (Digital WSL)Rich Hyde (Digital WSL)
     Susan Angebranndt (Digital WSL)Terry Weissman (Digital WSL)
     Mary Larson (Digital UEG)	   Mark Manasse (Digital SRC)
     Jim Gettys	 (Digital SRC)	   Leo Treggiari  (Digital SDT)
     Ralph Swick (Project Athena and Digital ERP)Mark Ackerman (Project Athena)
     Ron Newman (Project Athena)   Bob Scheifler (MIT LCS)


The contributors to the X10 toolkit also deserve mention.
Although the X11 Intrinsics present an entirely different
programming style, they borrow heavily from the implicit and
explicit concepts in the X10 toolkit.

The design and implementation of the X10 Intrinsics were
done by:


     Terry Weissman (Digital WSL)
     Smokey Wallace (Digital WSL)
     Phil Karlton (Digital WSL)
     Charles Haynes (Digital WSL)
     Frank Hall (HP)


The design and implementation of the X10 toolkit's sample
widgets were by the above, as well as by:


     Ram Rao (Digital UEG)
     Mary Larson (Digital UEG)
     Mike Gancarz (Digital UEG)
     Kathleen Langone  (Digital UEG)

These widgets provided a checklist of requirements that we
had to address in the X11 Intrinsics.

Thanks go to Al Mento of Digital's UEG Documentation Group
for formatting and generally improving this document and to
John Ousterhout of Berkeley for extensively reviewing early
drafts of it.

Finally, a special thanks to Mike Chow, whose extensive per-
formance analysis of the X10 toolkit provided the justifica-
tion to redesign it entirely for X11.

The current design of the Intrinsics has benefited greatly
from the input of several dedicated reviewers in the member-
ship of the X Consortium.  In addition to those already men-
tioned, the following individuals have dedicated significant
time to suggesting improvements to the Intrinsics:


     Steve Pitschke (Stellar)	   C. Doug Blewett (AT&T)
     Bob Miller (HP)		   David Schiferl (Tektronix)
     Fred Taft (HP)		   Michael Squires (Sequent)

From Release 3 to Release 4, several new members joined the
design team.  We greatly appreciate the thoughtful comments,
suggestions, lengthy discussions, and in some cases imple-
mentation code contributed by each of the following:


     Don Alecci (AT&T)		   Ellis Cohen (OSF)
     Donna Converse (MIT)	   Clive Feather (IXI)
     Nayeem Islam (Sun)		   Dana Laursen (HP)
     Keith Packard (MIT)	   Chris Peterson (MIT)
     Richard Probst (Sun)	   Larry Cable (Sun)



In Release 5, the effort to define the internationalization
additions was headed by Bill McMahon of Hewlett Packard and
Frank Rojas of IBM.  This has been an educational process
for many of us, and Bill and Frank's tutelage has carried us
through.  Vania Joloboff of the OSF also contributed to the
internationalization additions.	 The implementation efforts
of Bill, Gabe Beged-Dov, and especially Donna Converse for
this release are also gratefully acknowledged.

		     1mAbout This Manual0m



4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m is intended to
be read by both application programmers who will use one or
more of the many widget sets built with the Intrinsics and
by widget programmers who will use the Intrinsics to build
widgets for one of the widget sets.  Not all the information
in this manual, however, applies to both audiences.  That
is, because the application programmer is likely to use only
a number of the Intrinsics functions in writing an applica-
tion and because the widget programmer is likely to use many
more, if not all, of the Intrinsics functions in building a
widget, an attempt has been made to highlight those areas of
information that are deemed to be of special interest for
the application programmer.  (It is assumed the widget pro-
grammer will have to be familiar with all the information.)
Therefore, all entries in the table of contents that are
printed in 1mbold 22mindicate the information that should be of
special interest to an application programmer.

It is also assumed that, as application programmers become
more familiar with the concepts discussed in this manual,
they will find it more convenient to implement portions of
their applications as special-purpose or custom widgets.  It
is possible, nonetheless, to use widgets without knowing how
to build them.

1mConventions Used in this Manual0m

This document uses the following conventions:

    Global symbols are printed in 4mthis24m 4mspecial24m 4mfont24m.  These
     can be either function names, symbols defined in
     include files, data types, or structure names.  Argu-
     ments to functions, procedures, or macros are printed
     in 4mitalics24m.

    Each function is introduced by a general discussion
     that distinguishes it from other functions.  The func-
     tion declaration itself follows, and each argument is
     specifically explained.  General discussion of the
     function, if any is required, follows the arguments.

    To eliminate any ambiguity between those arguments that
     you pass and those that a function returns to you, the
     explanations for all arguments that you pass start with
     the word 4mspecifies24m or, in the case of multiple argu-
     ments, the word 4mspecify24m.  The explanations for all
     arguments that are returned to you start with the word
     4mreturns24m or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word

		     1mIntrinsics and Widgets0m



The Intrinsics are a programming library tailored to the
special requirements of user interface construction within a
network window system, specifically the X Window System.
The Intrinsics and a widget set make up an X Toolkit.


1m1.1.	Intrinsics0m

The Intrinsics provide the base mechanism necessary to build
a wide variety of interoperating widget sets and application
environments.  The Intrinsics are a layer on top of Xlib,
the C Library X Interface.  They extend the fundamental
abstractions provided by the X Window System while still
remaining independent of any particular user interface pol-
icy or style.

The Intrinsics use object-oriented programming techniques to
supply a consistent architecture for constructing and com-
posing user interface components, known as widgets.  This
allows programmers to extend a widget set in new ways,
either by deriving new widgets from existing ones (subclass-
ing) or by writing entirely new widgets following the estab-
lished conventions.

When the Intrinsics were first conceived, the root of the
object hierarchy was a widget class named Core.	 In Release
4 of the Intrinsics, three nonwidget superclasses were added
above Core.  These superclasses are described in Chapter 12.
The name of the class now at the root of the Intrinsics
class hierarchy is Object.  The remainder of this specifica-
tion refers uniformly to 4mwidgets24m and 4mCore24m as if they were
the base class for all Intrinsics operations.  The argument
descriptions for each Intrinsics procedure and Chapter 12
describe which operations are defined for the nonwidget
superclasses of Core.  The reader may determine by context
whether a specific reference to 4mwidget24m actually means ``wid-
get'' or ``object.''


1m1.2.	Languages0m

The Intrinsics are intended to be used for two programming
purposes.  Programmers writing widgets will be using most of
the facilities provided by the Intrinsics to construct user
interface components from the simple, such as buttons and
scrollbars, to the complex, such as control panels and



			      1m10m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


property sheets.  Application programmers will use a much
smaller subset of the Intrinsics procedures in combination
with one or more sets of widgets to construct and present
complete user interfaces on an X display.  The Intrinsics
programming interfaces primarily intended for application
use are designed to be callable from most procedural pro-
gramming languages.  Therefore, most arguments are passed by
reference rather than by value.	 The interfaces primarily
intended for widget programmers are expected to be used
principally from the C language.  In these cases, the usual
C programming conventions apply.  In this specification, the
term 4mclient24m refers to any module, widget, or application
that calls an Intrinsics procedure.

Applications that use the Intrinsics mechanisms must include
the header files <4mX11/Intrinsic.h24m> and <4mX11/StringDefs.h24m>,
or their equivalent, and they may also include
<4mX11/Xatoms.h24m> and <4mX11/Shell.h24m>.  In addition, widget
implementations should include <4mX11/IntrinsicP.h24m> instead of
<4mX11/Intrinsic.h24m>.

The applications must also include the additional header
files for each widget class that they are to use (for exam-
ple, <4mX11/Xaw/Label.h24m> or <4mX11/Xaw/Scrollbar.h24m>).  On a
POSIX-based system, the Intrinsics object library file is
named 4mlibXt.a24m and is usually referenced as -lXt when linking
the application.


1m1.3.	Procedures and Macros0m

All functions defined in this specification except those
specified below may be implemented as C macros with argu-
ments.	C applications may use ``#undef'' to remove a macro
definition and ensure that the actual function is refer-
enced.	Any such macro will expand to a single expression
that has the same precedence as a function call and that
evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully pro-
tected by parentheses, so that arbitrary expressions may be
used as arguments.

The following symbols are macros that do not have function
equivalents and that may expand their arguments in a manner
other than that described above: 4mXtCheckSubclass24m, 4mXtNew24m,
4mXtNumber24m, 4mXtOffsetOf24m, 4mXtOffset24m, and 4mXtSetArg24m.


1m1.4.	Widgets0m


The fundamental abstraction and data type of the X Toolkit
is the widget, which is a combination of an X window and its
associated input and display semantics and which is dynami-
cally allocated and contains state information.	 Some



			      1m20m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


widgets display information (for example, text or graphics),
and others are merely containers for other widgets (for
example, a menu box).  Some widgets are output-only and do
not react to pointer or keyboard input, and others change
their display in response to input and can invoke functions
that an application has attached to them.

Every widget belongs to exactly one widget class, which is
statically allocated and initialized and which contains the
operations allowable on widgets of that class.	Logically, a
widget class is the procedures and data associated with all
widgets belonging to that class.  These procedures and data
can be inherited by subclasses.	 Physically, a widget class
is a pointer to a structure.  The contents of this structure
are constant for all widgets of the widget class but will
vary from class to class.  (Here, ``constant'' means the
class structure is initialized at compile time and never
changed, except for a one-time class initialization and in-
place compilation of resource lists, which takes place when
the first widget of the class or subclass is created.)	For
further information, see Section 2.5.

The distribution of the declarations and code for a new wid-
get class among a public .h file for application programmer
use, a private .h file for widget programmer use, and the
implementation .c file is described in Section 1.6.  The
predefined widget classes adhere to these conventions.

A widget instance is composed of two parts:

    A data structure which contains instance-specific val-
     ues.

    A class structure which contains information that is
     applicable to all widgets of that class.

Much of the input/output of a widget (for example, fonts,
colors, sizes, or border widths) is customizable by users.

This chapter discusses the base widget classes, Core, Com-
posite, and Constraint, and ends with a discussion of widget
classing.


1m1.4.1.  Core Widgets0m

The Core widget class contains the definitions of fields
common to all widgets.	All widgets classes are subclasses
of the Core class, which is defined by the 4mCoreClassPart24m and
4mCorePart24m structures.

1m1.5.	Implementation-Specific Types0m

To increase the portability of widget and application source
code between different system environments, the Intrinsics
define several types whose precise representation is explic-
itly dependent upon, and chosen by, each individual imple-
mentation of the Intrinsics.

These implementation-defined types are

1mBoolean    22mA datum that contains a zero or nonzero value.
	   Unless explicitly stated, clients should not
	   assume that the nonzero value is equal to the
	   symbolic value 4mTrue24m.

1mCardinal   22mAn unsigned integer datum with a minimum range of
	   [0..2^16-1].

1mDimension  22mAn unsigned integer datum with a minimum range of
	   [0..2^16-1].

1mPosition   22mA signed integer datum with a minimum range of
	   [-2^15..2^15-1].

1mXtPointer  22mA datum large enough to contain the largest of a
	   char*, int*, function pointer, structure pointer,



			     1m140m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


	   or long value.  A pointer to any type or func-
	   tion, or a long value may be converted to an
	   4mXtPointer24m and back again and the result will com-
	   pare equal to the original value.  In ANSI C
	   environments it is expected that 4mXtPointer24m will
	   be defined as void*.

1mXtArgVal   22mA datum large enough to contain an 4mXtPointer24m,
	   4mCardinal24m, 4mDimension24m, or 4mPosition24m value.

1mXtEnum     22mAn integer datum large enough to encode at least
	   128 distinct values, two of which are the sym-
	   bolic values 4mTrue24m and 4mFalse24m.  The symbolic values
	   4mTRUE24m and 4mFALSE24m are also defined to be equal to
	   4mTrue24m and 4mFalse24m, respectively.

In addition to these specific types, the precise order of
the fields within the structure declarations for any of the
instance part records 4mObjectPart24m, 4mRectObjPart24m, 4mCorePart24m,
4mCompositePart24m, 4mShellPart24m, 4mWMShellPart24m, 4mTopLevelShellPart24m,
and 4mApplicationShellPart24m is implementation-defined.  These
structures may also have additional private fields internal
to the implementation.	The 4mObjectPart24m, 4mRectObjPart24m, and
4mCorePart24m structures must be defined so that any member with
the same name appears at the same offset in 4mObjectRec24m, 4mRect-0m
4mObjRec24m, and 4mCoreRec24m (4mWidgetRec24m).	 No other relations between
the offsets of any two fields may be assumed.


1m1.6.	Widget Classing0m

The 4mwidget_class24m field of a widget points to its widget
class structure, which contains information that is constant
across all widgets of that class.  As a consequence, widgets
usually do not implement directly callable procedures;
rather, they implement procedures, called methods, that are
available through their widget class structure.	 These meth-
ods are invoked by generic procedures that envelop common
actions around the methods implemented by the widget class.
Such procedures are applicable to all widgets of that class
and also to widgets whose classes are subclasses of that
class.

All widget classes are a subclass of Core and can be sub-
classed further.  Subclassing reduces the amount of code and
declarations necessary to make a new widget class that is
similar to an existing class.  For example, you do not have
to describe every resource your widget uses in an 4mXtRe-0m
4msourceList24m.  Instead, you describe only the resources your
widget has that its superclass does not.  Subclasses usually
inherit many of their superclasses' procedures (for example,
the expose procedure or geometry handler).





			     1m150m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Subclassing, however, can be taken too far.  If you create a
subclass that inherits none of the procedures of its super-
class, you should consider whether you have chosen the most
appropriate superclass.

To make good use of subclassing, widget declarations and
naming conventions are highly stylized.	 A widget consists
of three files:

    A public .h file, used by client widgets or applica-
     tions.

    A private .h file, used by widgets whose classes are
     subclasses of the widget class.

    A .c file, which implements the widget.


1m1.6.1.  Widget Naming Conventions0m

The Intrinsics provide a vehicle by which programmers can
create new widgets and organize a collection of widgets into
an application.	 To ensure that applications need not deal
with as many styles of capitalization and spelling as the
number of widget classes it uses, the following guidelines
should be followed when writing new widgets:

    Use the X library naming conventions that are applica-
     ble.  For example, a record component name is all low-
     ercase and uses underscores (_) for compound words (for
     example, background_pixmap).  Type and procedure names
     start with uppercase and use capitalization for com-
     pound words (for example, 4mArgList24m or 4mXtSetValues24m).

    A resource name is spelled identically to the field
     name except that compound names use capitalization
     rather than underscore.  To let the compiler catch
     spelling errors, each resource name should have a sym-
     bolic identifier prefixed with ``XtN''.  For example,
     the 4mbackground_pixmap24m field has the corresponding iden-
     tifier XtNbackgroundPixmap, which is defined as the
     string ``backgroundPixmap''.  Many predefined names are
     listed in <4mX11/StringDefs.h24m>.	 Before you invent a new
     name, you should make sure there is not already a name
     that you can use.

    A resource class string starts with a capital letter
     and uses capitalization for compound names (for exam-
     ple,``BorderWidth'').  Each resource class string
     should have a symbolic identifier prefixed with ``XtC''
     (for example, XtCBorderWidth).  Many predefined classes
     are listed in <4mX11/StringDefs.h24m>.





			     1m160m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    A resource representation string is spelled identically
     to the type name (for example, ``TranslationTable'').
     Each representation string should have a symbolic iden-
     tifier prefixed with ``XtR'' (for example, XtRTransla-
     tionTable).  Many predefined representation types are
     listed in <4mX11/StringDefs.h24m>.

    New widget classes start with a capital and use upper-
     case for compound words.  Given a new class name
     AbcXyz, you should derive several names:

     -	  Additional widget instance structure part name
	  AbcXyzPart.

     -	  Complete widget instance structure names AbcXyzRec
	  and _AbcXyzRec.

     -	  Widget instance structure pointer type name
	  AbcXyzWidget.

     -	  Additional class structure part name AbcXyzClass-
	  Part.

     -	  Complete class structure names AbcXyzClassRec and
	  _AbcXyzClassRec.

     -	  Class structure pointer type name AbcXyzWidget-
	  Class.

     -	  Class structure variable abcXyzClassRec.

     -	  Class structure pointer variable abcXyzWidget-
	  Class.

    Action procedures available to translation specifica-
     tions should follow the same naming conventions as pro-
     cedures.  That is, they start with a capital letter,
     and compound names use uppercase (for example, ``High-
     light'' and ``NotifyClient'').

The symbolic identifiers XtN..., XtC..., and XtR...  may be
implemented as macros, as global symbols, or as a mixture of
the two.  The (implicit) type of the identifier is 4mString24m.
The pointer value itself is not significant; clients must
not assume that inequality of two identifiers implies
inequality of the resource name, class, or representation
string.	 Clients should also note that although global sym-
bols permit savings in literal storage in some environments,
they also introduce the possibility of multiple definition
conflicts when applications attempt to use independently
developed widgets simultaneously.

1m1.6.2.  Widget Subclassing in Public .h Files0m

The public .h file for a widget class is imported by clients
and contains

    A reference to the public .h file for the superclass.

    Symbolic identifiers for the names and classes of the
     new resources that this widget adds to its superclass.
     The definitions should have a single space between the
     definition name and the value and no trailing space or
     comment in order to reduce the possibility of compiler
     warnings from similar declarations in multiple classes.

    Type declarations for any new resource data types
     defined by the class.

    The class record pointer variable used to create widget
     instances.

    The C type that corresponds to widget instances of this
     class.

    Entry points for new class methods.

For example, the following is the public .h file for a pos-
sible implementation of a Label widget:


     #ifndef LABEL_H
     #define LABEL_H

     /* New resources */
     #define XtNjustify "justify"
     #define XtNforeground "foreground"
     #define XtNlabel "label"
     #define XtNfont "font"
     #define XtNinternalWidth "internalWidth"
     #define XtNinternalHeight "internalHeight"

     /* Class record pointer */
     extern WidgetClass labelWidgetClass;

     /* C Widget type definition */
     typedef struct _LabelRec	   *LabelWidget;

     /* New class method entry points */
     extern void LabelSetText();
	  /* Widget w */
	  /* String text */

     extern String LabelGetText();
	  /* Widget w */




			     1m180m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     #endif LABEL_H


The conditional inclusion of the text allows the application
to include header files for different widgets without being
concerned that they already may be included as a superclass
of another widget.

To accommodate operating systems with file name length
restrictions, the name of the public .h file is the first
ten characters of the widget class.  For example, the public
.h file for the Constraint widget class is 4mConstraint.h24m.


1m1.6.3.  Widget Subclassing in Private .h Files0m

The private .h file for a widget is imported by widget
classes that are subclasses of the widget and contains

    A reference to the public .h file for the class.

    A reference to the private .h file for the superclass.

    Symbolic identifiers for any new resource representa-
     tion types defined by the class.  The definitions
     should have a single space between the definition name
     and the value and no trailing space or comment.

    A structure part definition for the new fields that the
     widget instance adds to its superclass's widget struc-
     ture.

    The complete widget instance structure definition for
     this widget.

    A structure part definition for the new fields that
     this widget class adds to its superclass's constraint
     structure if the widget class is a subclass of Con-
     straint.

    The complete constraint structure definition if the
     widget class is a subclass of Constraint.

    Type definitions for any new procedure types used by
     class methods declared in the widget class part.

    A structure part definition for the new fields that
     this widget class adds to its superclass's widget class
     structure.

    The complete widget class structure definition for this
     widget.





			     1m190m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    The complete widget class extension structure defini-
     tion for this widget, if any.

    The symbolic constant identifying the class extension
     version, if any.

    The name of the global class structure variable con-
     taining the generic class structure for this class.

    An inherit constant for each new procedure in the wid-
     get class part structure.

For example, the following is the private .h file for a pos-
sible Label widget:

To accommodate operating systems with file name length
restrictions, the name of the private .h file is the first
nine characters of the widget class followed by a capital P.
For example, the private .h file for the Constraint widget
class is 4mConstrainP.h24m.


1m1.6.4.  Widget Subclassing in .c Files0m

The .c file for a widget contains the structure initializer
for the class record variable, which contains the following
parts:

    Class information (for example, 4msuperclass24m, 4mclass_name24m,
     4mwidget_size24m, 4mclass_initialize24m, and 4mclass_inited24m).

    Data constants (for example, 4mresources24m and
     4mnum_resources24m, 4mactions24m and 4mnum_actions24m, 4mvisible_inter-0m
     4mest24m, 4mcompress_motion24m, 4mcompress_exposure24m, and 4mversion24m).

    Widget operations (for example, 4minitialize24m, 4mrealize24m,
     4mdestroy24m, 4mresize24m, 4mexpose24m, 4mset_values24m, 4maccept_focus24m, and
     any new operations specific to the widget).





			     1m210m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


The 4msuperclass24m field points to the superclass global class
record, declared in the superclass private .h file.  For
direct subclasses of the generic core widget, 4msuperclass0m
should be initialized to the address of the 4mwidgetClassRec0m
structure.  The superclass is used for class chaining opera-
tions and for inheriting or enveloping a superclass's opera-
tions (see Sections 1.6.7, 1.6.9, and 1.6.10).

The 4mclass_name24m field contains the text name for this class,
which is used by the resource manager.	For example, the
Label widget has the string ``Label''.	More than one widget
class can share the same text class name.  This string must
be permanently allocated prior to or during the execution of
the class initialization procedure and must not be subse-
quently deallocated.


The 4mwidget_size24m field is the size of the corresponding wid-
get instance structure (not the size of the class struc-
ture).

The 4mversion24m field indicates the toolkit implementation ver-
sion number and is used for runtime consistency checking of
the X Toolkit and widgets in an application.  Widget writers
must set it to the implementation-defined symbolic value
4mXtVersion24m in the widget class structure initialization.
Those widget writers who believe that their widget binaries
are compatible with other implementations of the Intrinsics
can put the special value 4mXtVersionDontCheck24m in the 4mversion0m
field to disable version checking for those widgets.  If a
widget needs to compile alternative code for different revi-
sions of the Intrinsics interface definition, it may use the
symbol 4mXtSpecificationRelease24m, as described in Chapter 13.
Use of 4mXtVersion24m allows the Intrinsics implementation to
recognize widget binaries that were compiled with older
implementations.

The 4mextension24m field is for future upward compatibility.  If
the widget programmer adds fields to class parts, all sub-
class structure layouts change, requiring complete recompi-
lation.	 To allow clients to avoid recompilation, an exten-
sion field at the end of each class part can point to a
record that contains any additional class information
required.

All other fields are described in their respective sections.

The .c file also contains the declaration of the global
class structure pointer variable used to create instances of
the class.  The following is an abbreviated version of the
.c file for a Label widget.  The resources table is
described in Chapter 9.

1m1.6.5.  Widget Class and Superclass Look Up0m

To obtain the class of a widget, use 4mXtClass24m.

__
|
WidgetClass XtClass(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget. Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtClass24m function returns a pointer to the widget's class
structure.




			     1m240m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To obtain the superclass of a widget, use 4mXtSuperclass24m.

__
|
WidgetClass XtSuperclass(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget. Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtSuperclass24m function returns a pointer to the widget's
superclass class structure.


1m1.6.6.  Widget Subclass Verification0m

To check the subclass to which a widget belongs, use 4mXtIs-0m
4mSubclass24m.

__
|
Boolean XtIsSubclass(4mw24m, 4mwidget_class24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget or object instance whose
	  class is to be checked.  Must be of class Object
	  or any subclass thereof.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class for which to test. Must
	  be 1mobjectClass 22mor any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtIsSubclass24m function returns 4mTrue24m if the class of the
specified widget is equal to or is a subclass of the speci-
fied class.  The widget's class can be any number of sub-
classes down the chain and need not be an immediate subclass
of the specified class.	 Composite widgets that need to
restrict the class of the items they contain can use 4mXtIs-0m
4mSubclass24m to find out if a widget belongs to the desired
class of objects.


To test if a given widget belongs to a subclass of an
Intrinsics-defined class, the Intrinsics define macros or
functions equivalent to 4mXtIsSubclass24m for each of the built-
in classes.  These procedures are 4mXtIsObject24m, 4mXtIsRectObj24m,
4mXtIsWidget24m, 4mXtIsComposite24m, 4mXtIsConstraint24m, 4mXtIsShell24m,
4mXtIsOverrideShell24m, 4mXtIsWMShell24m, 4mXtIsVendorShell24m, 4mXtIsTran-0m
4msientShell24m, 4mXtIsTopLevelShell24m, 4mXtIsApplicationShell24m, and



			     1m250m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtIsSessionShell24m.

All these macros and functions have the same argument
description.

__
|
Boolean XtIs4m<class>24m (4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget or object instance whose
	  class is to be checked.  Must be of class Object
	  or any subclass thereof.
|__

These procedures may be faster than calling 4mXtIsSubclass0m
directly for the built-in classes.


To check a widget's class and to generate a debugging error
message, use 4mXtCheckSubclass24m, defined in <4mX11/IntrinsicP.h24m>:

__
|
void XtCheckSubclass(4mw24m, 4mwidget_class24m, 4mmessage24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;
      String 4mmessage24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget or object whose class is to
	  be checked.  Must be of class Object or any sub-
	  class thereof.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class for which to test.
	  Must be 1mobjectClass 22mor any subclass thereof.

4mmessage24m   Specifies the message to be used.
|__

The 4mXtCheckSubclass24m macro determines if the class of the
specified widget is equal to or is a subclass of the speci-
fied class.  The widget's class can be any number of sub-
classes down the chain and need not be an immediate subclass
of the specified class.	 If the specified widget's class is
not a subclass, 4mXtCheckSubclass24m constructs an error message
from the supplied message, the widget's actual class, and
the expected class and calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.  4mXtCheckSubclass0m
should be used at the entry point of exported routines to
ensure that the client has passed in a valid widget class
for the exported operation.




			     1m260m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtCheckSubclass24m is only executed when the module has been
compiled with the compiler symbol DEBUG defined; otherwise,
it is defined as the empty string and generates no code.


1m1.6.7.  Superclass Chaining0m

While most fields in a widget class structure are self-con-
tained, some fields are linked to their corresponding fields
in their superclass structures.	 With a linked field, the
Intrinsics access the field's value only after accessing its
corresponding superclass value (called downward superclass
chaining) or before accessing its corresponding superclass
value (called upward superclass chaining).  The self-con-
tained fields are

In all widget classes:4mclass_name0m
		    4mclass_initialize0m
		    4mwidget_size0m
		    4mrealize0m
		    4mvisible_interest0m
		    4mresize0m
		    4mexpose0m
		    4maccept_focus0m
		    4mcompress_motion0m
		    4mcompress_exposure0m
		    4mcompress_enterleave0m
		    4mset_values_almost0m
		    4mtm_table0m
		    4mversion0m
		    4mallocate0m
		    4mdeallocate0m

In Composite widget classes:4mgeometry_manager0m
		    4mchange_managed0m
		    4minsert_child0m
		    4mdelete_child0m
		    4maccepts_objects0m
		    4mallows_change_managed_set0m

In Constraint widget classes:4mconstraint_size0m

In Shell widget classes:4mroot_geometry_manager0m


With downward superclass chaining, the invocation of an
operation first accesses the field from the Object, RectObj,
and Core class structures, then from the subclass structure,
and so on down the class chain to that widget's class struc-
ture.  These superclass-to-subclass fields are

	  4mclass_part_initialize0m
	  4mget_values_hook0m
	  4minitialize0m



			     1m270m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


	  4minitialize_hook0m
	  4mset_values0m
	  4mset_values_hook0m
	  4mresources0m


In addition, for subclasses of Constraint, the following
fields of the 4mConstraintClassPart24m and 4mConstraintClassExten-0m
4msionRec24m structures are chained from the Constraint class
down to the subclass:
	  4mresources0m
	  4minitialize0m
	  4mset_values0m
	  4mget_values_hook0m


With upward superclass chaining, the invocation of an opera-
tion first accesses the field from the widget class struc-
ture, then from the superclass structure, and so on up the
class chain to the Core, RectObj, and Object class struc-
tures.	The subclass-to-superclass fields are

	  4mdestroy0m
	  4mactions0m


For subclasses of Constraint, the following field of 4mCon-0m
4mstraintClassPart24m is chained from the subclass up to the Con-
straint class:

	  4mdestroy0m


1m1.6.8.  Class Initialization: class_initialize and0m
1mclass_part_initialize Procedures0m

Many class records can be initialized completely at compile
or link time.  In some cases, however, a class may need to
register type converters or perform other sorts of once-only
runtime initialization.

Because the C language does not have initialization proce-
dures that are invoked automatically when a program starts
up, a widget class can declare a class_initialize procedure
that will be automatically called exactly once by the
Intrinsics.  A class initialization procedure pointer is of
type 4mXtProc24m:










			     1m280m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtProc)(void);

|__

A widget class indicates that it has no class initialization
procedure by specifying NULL in the 4mclass_initialize24m field.

In addition to the class initialization that is done exactly
once, some classes perform initialization for fields in
their parts of the class record.  These are performed not
just for the particular class, but for subclasses as well,
and are done in the class's class part initialization proce-
dure, a pointer to which is stored in the 4mclass_part_ini-0m
4mtialize24m field.  The class_part_initialize procedure pointer
is of type 4mXtWidgetClassProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtWidgetClassProc)(WidgetClass);
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;


4mwidget_class0m
	  Points to the class structure for the class being
	  initialized.
|__

During class initialization, the class part initialization
procedures for the class and all its superclasses are called
in superclass-to-subclass order on the class record.  These
procedures have the responsibility of doing any dynamic ini-
tializations necessary to their class's part of the record.
The most common is the resolution of any inherited methods
defined in the class.  For example, if a widget class C has
superclasses Core, Composite, A, and B, the class record for
C first is passed to Core 's class_part_initialize proce-
dure.  This resolves any inherited Core methods and compiles
the textual representations of the resource list and action
table that are defined in the class record.  Next, Compos-
ite's class_part_initialize procedure is called to initial-
ize the composite part of C's class record.  Finally, the
class_part_initialize procedures for A, B, and C, in that
order, are called.  For further information, see Section
1.6.9.	Classes that do not define any new class fields or
that need no extra processing for them can specify NULL in
the 4mclass_part_initialize24m field.

All widget classes, whether they have a class initialization
procedure or not, must start with their 4mclass_inited24m field
4mFalse24m.

The first time a widget of a class is created, 4mXtCreateWid-0m
4mget24m ensures that the widget class and all superclasses are



			     1m290m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


initialized, in superclass-to-subclass order, by checking
each 4mclass_inited24m field and, if it is 4mFalse24m, by calling the
class_initialize and the class_part_initialize procedures
for the class and all its superclasses.	 The Intrinsics then
set the 4mclass_inited24m field to a nonzero value.  After the
one-time initialization, a class structure is constant.

The following example provides the class initialization pro-
cedure for a Label class.


     static void ClassInitialize()
     {
	  XtSetTypeConverter(XtRString, XtRJustify, CvtStringToJustify,
			 NULL, 0, XtCacheNone, NULL);
     }



1m1.6.9.  Initializing a Widget Class0m

A class is initialized when the first widget of that class
or any subclass is created.  To initialize a widget class
without creating any widgets, use 4mXtInitializeWidgetClass24m.

__
|
void XtInitializeWidgetClass(4mobject_class24m)
      WidgetClass 4mobject_class24m;


4mobject_class0m
	  Specifies the object class to initialize.  May be
	  4mobjectClass24m or any subclass thereof.
|__

If the specified widget class is already initialized, 4mXtIni-0m
4mtializeWidgetClass24m returns immediately.

If the class initialization procedure registers type con-
verters, these type converters are not available until the
first object of the class or subclass is created or 4mXtIni-0m
4mtializeWidgetClass24m is called (see Section 9.6).


1m1.6.10.  Inheritance of Superclass Operations0m

A widget class is free to use any of its superclass's self-
contained operations rather than implementing its own code.
The most frequently inherited operations are

     expose





			     1m300m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     realize

     insert_child

     delete_child

     geometry_manager

     set_values_almost

To inherit an operation 4mxyz24m, specify the constant 4mXtIn-0m
4mheritXyz24m in your class record.

Every class that declares a new procedure in its widget
class part must provide for inheriting the procedure in its
class_part_initialize procedure.  The chained operations
declared in Core and Constraint records are never inherited.
Widget classes that do nothing beyond what their superclass
does specify NULL for chained procedures in their class
records.

Inheriting works by comparing the value of the field with a
known, special value and by copying in the superclass's
value for that field if a match occurs.	 This special value,
called the inheritance constant, is usually the Intrinsics
internal value 4m_XtInherit24m cast to the appropriate type.
4m_XtInherit24m is a procedure that issues an error message if it
is actually called.

For example, 4mCompositeP.h24m contains these definitions:


     #define XtInheritGeometryManager ((XtGeometryHandler) _XtInherit)
     #define XtInheritChangeManaged ((XtWidgetProc) _XtInherit)
     #define XtInheritInsertChild ((XtArgsProc) _XtInherit)
     #define XtInheritDeleteChild ((XtWidgetProc) _XtInherit)


Composite's class_part_initialize procedure begins as fol-
lows:


     static void CompositeClassPartInitialize(widgetClass)
       WidgetClass widgetClass;
     {
       CompositeWidgetClass wc = (CompositeWidgetClass)widgetClass;
       CompositeWidgetClass super = (CompositeWidgetClass)wc->core_class.superclass;

       if (wc->composite_class.geometry_manager == XtInheritGeometryManager) {
	   wc->composite_class.geometry_manager = super->composite_class.geometry_manager;
       }

       if (wc->composite_class.change_managed == XtInheritChangeManaged) {
	   wc->composite_class.change_managed = super->composite_class.change_managed;



			     1m310m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


       }
       .
       .
       .


Nonprocedure fields may be inherited in the same manner as
procedure fields.  The class may declare any reserved value
it wishes for the inheritance constant for its new fields.
The following inheritance constants are defined:

For Object:

     4mXtInheritAllocate0m

     4mXtInheritDeallocate0m

For Core:

     4mXtInheritRealize0m

     4mXtInheritResize0m

     4mXtInheritExpose0m

     4mXtInheritSetValuesAlmost0m

     4mXtInheritAcceptFocus0m

     4mXtInheritQueryGeometry0m

     4mXtInheritTranslations0m

     4mXtInheritDisplayAccelerator0m

For Composite:

     4mXtInheritGeometryManager0m

     4mXtInheritChangeManaged0m

     4mXtInheritInsertChild0m

     4mXtInheritDeleteChild0m

For Shell:

     4mXtInheritRootGeometryManager0m


1m1.6.11.  Invocation of Superclass Operations0m

A widget sometimes needs to call a superclass operation that
is not chained.	 For example, a widget's expose procedure



			     1m320m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


might call its superclass's 4mexpose24m and then perform a little
more work on its own.  For example, a Composite class with
predefined managed children can implement insert_child by
first calling its superclass's 4minsert_child24m and then calling
4mXtManageChild24m to add the child to the managed set.


			    Note

     A class method should not use 4mXtSuperclass24m but
     should instead call the class method of its own
     specific superclass directly through the super-
     class record.  That is, it should use its own
     class pointers only, not the widget's class point-
     ers, as the widget's class may be a subclass of
     the class whose implementation is being refer-
     enced.

This technique is referred to as 4menveloping24m the superclass's
operation.


1m1.6.12.  Class Extension Records0m

It may be necessary at times to add new fields to already
existing widget class structures.  To permit this to be done
without requiring recompilation of all subclasses, the last
field in a class part structure should be an extension
pointer.  If no extension fields for a class have yet been
defined, subclasses should initialize the value of the
extension pointer to NULL.

If extension fields exist, as is the case with the Compos-
ite, Constraint, and Shell classes, subclasses can provide
values for these fields by setting the 4mextension24m pointer for
the appropriate part in their class structure to point to a
statically declared extension record containing the addi-
tional fields.	Setting the 4mextension24m field is never manda-
tory; code that uses fields in the extension record must
always check the 4mextension24m field and take some appropriate
default action if it is NULL.

In order to permit multiple subclasses and libraries to
chain extension records from a single 4mextension24m field,
extension records should be declared as a linked list, and
each extension record definition should contain the follow-
ing four fields at the beginning of the structure declara-
tion:









			     1m330m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
struct {
     XtPointer next_extension;
     XrmQuark record_type;
     long version;
     Cardinal record_size;
};


4mnext_extension0m
	    Specifies the next record in the list, or NULL.

4mrecord_type24m Specifies the particular structure declaration
	    to which each extension record instance con-
	    forms.

4mversion24m	 Specifies a version id symbolic constant sup-
	    plied by the definer of the structure.

4mrecord_size24m Specifies the total number of bytes allocated
	    for the extension record.
|__

The 4mrecord_type24m field identifies the contents of the exten-
sion record and is used by the definer of the record to
locate its particular extension record in the list.  The
4mrecord_type24m field is normally assigned the result of 4mXrm-0m
4mStringToQuark24m for a registered string constant.  The Intrin-
sics reserve all record type strings beginning with the two
characters ``XT'' for future standard uses.  The value 4mNUL-0m
4mLQUARK24m may also be used by the class part owner in extension
records attached to its own class part extension field to
identify the extension record unique to that particular
class.

The 4mversion24m field is an owner-defined constant that may be
used to identify binary files that have been compiled with
alternate definitions of the remainder of the extension
record data structure.	The private header file for a widget
class should provide a symbolic constant for subclasses to
use to initialize this field.  The 4mrecord_size24m field value
includes the four common header fields and should normally
be initialized with 4msizeof24m().

Any value stored in the class part extension fields of 4mCom-0m
4mpositeClassPart24m, 4mConstraintClassPart24m, or 4mShellClassPart24m must
point to an extension record conforming to this definition.

The Intrinsics provide a utility function for widget writers
to locate a particular class extension record in a linked
list, given a widget class and the offset of the 4mextension0m
field in the class record.





			     1m340m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To locate a class extension record, use 4mXtGetClassExtension24m.

__
|
XtPointer XtGetClassExtension(4mobject_class24m, 4mbyte_offset24m, 4mtype24m, 4mversion24m, 4mrecord_size24m)
      WidgetClass 4mobject_class24m;
      Cardinal 4mbyte_offset24m;
      XrmQuark 4mtype24m;
      long 4mversion24m;
      Cardinal 4mrecord_size24m;


4mobject_class0m
	  Specifies the object class containing the exten-
	  sion list to be searched.

4mbyte_offset0m
	  Specifies the offset in bytes from the base of the
	  class record of the extension field to be
	  searched.

4mtype24m      Specifies the record_type of the class extension
	  to be located.

4mversion24m   Specifies the minimum acceptable version of the
	  class extension required for a match.

4mrecord_size0m
	  Specifies the minimum acceptable length of the
	  class extension record required for a match, or 0.
|__

The list of extension records at the specified offset in the
specified object class will be searched for a match on the
specified type, a version greater than or equal to the spec-
ified version, and a record size greater than or equal the
specified record_size if it is nonzero.	 4mXtGetClassExtension0m
returns a pointer to a matching extension record or NULL if
no match is found.  The returned extension record must not
be modified or freed by the caller if the caller is not the
extension owner.

			 1mChapter 20m

		    1mWidget Instantiation0m



A hierarchy of widget instances constitutes a widget tree.
The shell widget returned by 4mXtAppCreateShell24m is the root of
the widget tree instance.  The widgets with one or more
children are the intermediate nodes of that tree, and the
widgets with no children of any kind are the leaves of the
widget tree.  With the exception of pop-up children (see
Chapter 5), this widget tree instance defines the associated
X Window tree.

Widgets can be either composite or primitive.  Both kinds of
widgets can contain children, but the Intrinsics provide a
set of management mechanisms for constructing and interfac-
ing between composite widgets, their children, and other
clients.

Composite widgets, that is, members of the class 4mcompos-0m
4miteWidgetClass24m, are containers for an arbitrary, but widget
implementation-defined, collection of children, which may be
instantiated by the composite widget itself, by other
clients, or by a combination of the two.  Composite widgets
also contain methods for managing the geometry (layout) of
any child widget.  Under unusual circumstances, a composite
widget may have zero children, but it usually has at least
one.  By contrast, primitive widgets that contain children
typically instantiate specific children of known classes
themselves and do not expect external clients to do so.
Primitive widgets also do not have general geometry manage-
ment methods.

In addition, the Intrinsics recursively perform many opera-
tions (for example, realization and destruction) on compos-
ite widgets and all their children.  Primitive widgets that
have children must be prepared to perform the recursive
operations themselves on behalf of their children.

A widget tree is manipulated by several Intrinsics func-
tions.	For example, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m traverses the tree
downward and recursively realizes all pop-up widgets and
children of composite widgets.	4mXtDestroyWidget24m traverses
the tree downward and destroys all pop-up widgets and chil-
dren of composite widgets.  The functions that fetch and
modify resources traverse the tree upward and determine the
inheritance of resources from a widget's ancestors.  4mXtMake-0m
4mGeometryRequest24m traverses the tree up one level and calls
the geometry manager that is responsible for a widget
child's geometry.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To facilitate upward traversal of the widget tree, each wid-
get has a pointer to its parent widget.	 The Shell widget
that 4mXtAppCreateShell24m returns has a 4mparent24m pointer of NULL.

To facilitate downward traversal of the widget tree, the
4mchildren24m field of each composite widget is a pointer to an
array of child widgets, which includes all normal children
created, not just the subset of children that are managed by
the composite widget's geometry manager.  Primitive widgets
that instantiate children are entirely responsible for all
operations that require downward traversal below themselves.
In addition, every widget has a pointer to an array of pop-
up children.


1m2.1.	Initializing the X Toolkit0m

Before an application can call any Intrinsics function other
than 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m and 4mXtToolkitThreadInitialize24m, it
must initialize the Intrinsics by using

    4mXtToolkitInitialize24m, which initializes the Intrinsics
     internals

    4mXtCreateApplicationContext24m, which initializes the per-
     application state

    4mXtDisplayInitialize24m or 4mXtOpenDisplay24m, which initializes
     the per-display state

    4mXtAppCreateShell24m, which creates the root of a widget
     tree

Or an application can call the convenience procedure 4mXtOpe-0m
4mnApplication24m, which combines the functions of the preceding
procedures.  An application wishing to use the ANSI C locale
mechanism should call 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m prior to calling
4mXtDisplayInitialize24m, 4mXtOpenDisplay24m, 4mXtOpenApplication24m, or
4mXtAppInitialize24m.

Multiple instances of X Toolkit applications may be imple-
mented in a single address space.  Each instance needs to be
able to read input and dispatch events independently of any
other instance.	 Further, an application instance may need
multiple display connections to have widgets on multiple
displays.  From the application's point of view, multiple
display connections usually are treated together as a single
unit for purposes of event dispatching.	 To accommodate both
requirements, the Intrinsics define application contexts,
each of which provides the information needed to distinguish
one application instance from another.	The major component
of an application context is a list of one or more X 4mDisplay0m
pointers for that application.	The Intrinsics handle all
display connections within a single application context



			     1m370m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


simultaneously, handling input in a round-robin fashion.
The application context type 4mXtAppContext24m is opaque to
clients.


To initialize the Intrinsics internals, use 4mXtToolkitIni-0m
4mtialize24m.

__
|
void XtToolkitInitialize()

|__

If 4mXtToolkitInitialize24m was previously called, it returns
immediately.  When 4mXtToolkitThreadInitialize24m is called
before 4mXtToolkitInitialize24m, the latter is protected against
simultaneous activation by multiple threads.


To create an application context, use 4mXtCreateApplication-0m
4mContext24m.

__
|
XtAppContext XtCreateApplicationContext()

|__

The 4mXtCreateApplicationContext24m function returns an applica-
tion context, which is an opaque type.	Every application
must have at least one application context.


To destroy an application context and close any remaining
display connections in it, use 4mXtDestroyApplicationContext24m.

__
|
void XtDestroyApplicationContext(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.
|__

The 4mXtDestroyApplicationContext24m function destroys the speci-
fied application context.  If called from within an event
dispatch (for example, in a callback procedure), 4mXtDestroy-0m
4mApplicationContext24m does not destroy the application context
until the dispatch is complete.

To get the application context in which a given widget was
created, use 4mXtWidgetToApplicationContext24m.

XtAppContext XtWidgetToApplicationContext(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget for which you want the appli-

	      Section 15.9 in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface0m

The 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m function retrieves the language
string to be used for the specified display (see Section
11.11), calls the language procedure (if set) with that lan-
guage string, builds the resource database for the default
screen, calls the Xlib 4mXrmParseCommand24m function to parse the
command line, and performs other per-display initialization.
After 4mXrmParseCommand24m has been called, 4margc24m and 4margv24m contain
only those parameters that were not in the standard option
table or in the table specified by the 4moptions24m argument.  If
the modified 4margc24m is not zero, most applications simply



			     1m400m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


print out the modified 4margv24m along with a message listing the
allowable options.  On POSIX-based systems, the application
name is usually the final component of 4margv24m[0].  If the syn-
chronous resource is 4mTrue24m, 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m calls the
Xlib 4mXSynchronize24m function to put Xlib into synchronous mode
for this display connection and any others currently open in
the application context.  See Sections 2.3 and 2.4 for
details on the 4mapplication_name24m, 4mapplication_class24m, 4moptions24m,
and 4mnum_options24m arguments.

4mXtDisplayInitialize24m calls 4mXrmSetDatabase24m to associate the
resource database of the default screen with the display
before returning.

The 4mXtOpenDisplay24m function calls 4mXOpenDisplay24m with the spec-
ified 4mdisplay_string24m.  If 4mdisplay_string24m is NULL, 4mXtOpenDis-0m
4mplay24m uses the current value of the -display option specified
in 4margv24m.  If no display is specified in 4margv24m, the user's
default display is retrieved from the environment.  On
POSIX-based systems, this is the value of the 4mDISPLAY24m envi-
ronment variable.





			     1m420m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


If this succeeds, 4mXtOpenDisplay24m then calls 4mXtDisplayInitial-0m
4mize24m and passes it the opened display and the value of the
-name option specified in 4margv24m as the application name.  If
no -name option is specified and 4mapplication_name24m is non-
NULL, 4mapplication_name24m is passed to 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m.  If
4mapplication_name24m is NULL and if the environment variable
4mRESOURCE_NAME24m is set, the value of 4mRESOURCE_NAME24m is used.
Otherwise, the application name is the name used to invoke
the program.  On implementations that conform to ANSI C
Hosted Environment support, the application name will be
4margv24m[0] less any directory and file type components, that
is, the final component of 4margv24m[0], if specified.	If
4margv24m[0] does not exist or is the empty string, the applica-
tion name is ``main''.	4mXtOpenDisplay24m returns the newly
opened display or NULL if it failed.

See Section 7.12 for information regarding the use of
4mXtOpenDisplay24m in multiple threads.


To close a display and remove it from an application con-
text, use 4mXtCloseDisplay24m.

__
|
void XtCloseDisplay(4mdisplay24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display.
|__

The 4mXtCloseDisplay24m function calls 4mXCloseDisplay24m with the
specified 4mdisplay24m as soon as it is safe to do so.	If called
from within an event dispatch (for example, a callback pro-
cedure), 4mXtCloseDisplay24m does not close the display until the
dispatch is complete.  Note that applications need only call
4mXtCloseDisplay24m if they are to continue executing after clos-
ing the display; otherwise, they should call 4mXtDestroyAppli-0m
4mcationContext24m.

See Section 7.12 for information regarding the use of
4mXtCloseDisplay24m in multiple threads.


1m2.2.	Establishing the Locale0m

Resource databases are specified to be created in the cur-
rent process locale.  During display initialization prior to
creating the per-screen resource database, the Intrinsics
will call out to a specified application procedure to set
the locale according to options found on the command line or
in the per-display resource specifications.




			     1m430m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


The callout procedure provided by the application is of type
4mXtLanguageProc24m.

__
|
typedef String (*XtLanguageProc)(Display*, String, XtPointer);
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      String 4mlanguage24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mdisplay24m   Passes the display.

4mlanguage24m  Passes the initial language value obtained from
	  the command line or server per-display resource
	  specifications.

4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the additional client data specified in the
	  call to 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m.
|__

The language procedure allows an application to set the
locale to the value of the language resource determined by
4mXtDisplayInitialize24m.  The function returns a new language
string that will be subsequently used by 4mXtDisplayInitialize0m
to establish the path for loading resource files.  The
returned string	 will be copied by the Intrinsics into new
memory.

Initially, no language procedure is set by the Intrinsics.
To set the language procedure for use by 4mXtDisplayInitial-0m
4mize24m, use 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m.

__
|
XtLanguageProc XtSetLanguageProc(4mapp_context24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtLanguageProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context in which the
	  language procedure is to be used, or NULL.

4mproc24m      Specifies the language procedure.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies additional client data to be passed to
	  the language procedure when it is called.
|__

4mXtSetLanguageProc24m sets the language procedure that will be



			     1m440m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


called from 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m for all subsequent Displays
initialized in the specified application context.   If
4mapp_context24m is NULL, the specified language procedure is
registered in all application contexts created by the call-
ing process, including any future application contexts that
may be created.	  If 4mproc24m is NULL, a default language proce-
dure is registered.  4mXtSetLanguageProc24m returns the previ-
ously registered language procedure.  If a language proce-
dure has not yet been registered, the return value is
unspecified, but if this return value is used in a subse-
quent call to 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m, it will cause the default
language procedure to be registered.

The default language procedure does the following:

    Sets the locale according to the environment.  On ANSI
     C-based systems this is done by calling 4msetlocale24m(
     4mLC_ALL24m, 4mlanguage24m ).  If an error is encountered, a
     warning message is issued with 4mXtWarning24m.

    Calls 4mXSupportsLocale24m to verify that the current locale
     is supported.  If the locale is not supported, a warn-
     ing message is issued with 4mXtWarning24m and the locale is
     set to ``C''.

    Calls 4mXSetLocaleModifiers24m specifying the empty string.

    Returns the value of the current locale.  On ANSI C-
     based systems this is the return value from a final
     call to 4msetlocale24m( 4mLC_ALL24m, NULL ).

A client wishing to use this mechanism to establish locale
can do so by calling 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m prior to 4mXtDis-0m
4mplayInitialize24m, as in the following example.


     Widget top;
     XtSetLanguageProc(NULL, NULL, NULL);
     top = XtOpenApplication(...);
     ...



1m2.3.	Loading the Resource Database0m

The 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m function first determines the lan-
guage string to be used for the specified display.  It then
creates a resource database for the default screen of the
display by combining the following sources in order, with
the entries in the first named source having highest prece-
dence:






			     1m450m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Application command line (4margc24m, 4margv24m).

    Per-host user environment resource file on the local
     host.

    Per-screen resource specifications from the server.

    Per-display resource specifications from the server or
     from
     the user preference file on the local host.

    Application-specific user resource file on the local
     host.

    Application-specific class resource file on the local
     host.


When the resource database for a particular screen on the
display is needed (either internally, or when 4mXtScreen-0m
4mDatabase24m is called), it is created in the following manner
using the sources listed above in the same order:


    A temporary database, the ``server resource database'',
     is created from the string returned by 4mXResourceMan-0m
     4magerString24m or, if 4mXResourceManagerString24m returns NULL,
     the contents of a resource file in the user's home
     directory.	 On POSIX-based systems, the usual name for
     this user preference resource file is $HOME/1m.Xdefaults22m.


    If a language procedure has been set, 4mXtDisplayInitial-0m
     4mize24m first searches the command line for the option
     ``-xnlLanguage'', or for a -xrm option that specifies
     the xnlLanguage/XnlLanguage resource, as specified by
     Section 2.4.  If such a resource is found, the value is
     assumed to be entirely in XPCS, the X Portable Charac-
     ter Set.  If neither option is specified on the command
     line, 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m queries the server resource
     database (which is assumed to be entirely in XPCS) for
     the resource 4mname24m1m.xnlLanguage22m, class 4mClass24m1m.XnlLanguage0m
     where 4mname24m and 4mClass24m are the 4mapplication_name24m and
     4mapplication_class24m specified to 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m.
     The language procedure is then invoked with the
     resource value if found, else the empty string.  The
     string returned from the language procedure is saved
     for all future references in the Intrinsics that
     require the per-display language string.


    The screen resource database is initialized by parsing
     the command line in the manner specified by Section
     2.4.



			     1m460m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    If a language procedure has not been set, the initial
     database is then queried for the resource 4mname24m1m.xnlLan-0m
     1mguage22m, class 4mClass24m1m.XnlLanguage 22mas specified above.	If
     this database query fails, the server resource database
     is queried; if this query also fails, the language is
     determined from the environment; on POSIX-based sys-
     tems, this is done by retrieving the value of the 4mLANG0m
     environment variable.  If no language string is found,
     the empty string is used.	This language string is
     saved for all future references in the Intrinsics that
     require the per-display language string.


    After determining the language string, the user's envi-
     ronment resource file is then merged into the initial
     resource database if the file exists.  This file is
     user-, host-, and process-specific and is expected to
     contain user preferences that are to override those
     specifications in the per-display and per-screen
     resources.	 On POSIX-based systems, the user's environ-
     ment resource file name is specified by the value of
     the 4mXENVIRONMENT24m environment variable.  If this envi-
     ronment variable does not exist, the user's home direc-
     tory is searched for a file named 4m.Xdefaults-host,0m
     4mwhere24m 4mhost24m 4mis24m 4mthe24m 4mhost24m 4mname24m 4mof24m 4mthe24m 4mmachine24m 4mon24m 4mwhich24m 4mthe0m
     4mapplication24m 4mis24m 4mrunning.0m


    The per-screen resource specifications are then merged
     into the screen resource database, if they exist.
     These specifications are the string returned by
     4mXScreenResourceString24m for the respective screen and are
     owned entirely by the user.


    Next, the server resource database created earlier is
     merged into the screen resource database.	The server
     property, and corresponding user preference file, are
     owned and constructed entirely by the user.


    The application-specific user resource file from the
     local host is then merged into the screen resource
     database.	This file contains user customizations and
     is stored in a directory owned by the user.  Either the
     user or the application or both can store resource
     specifications in the file.  Each should be prepared to
     find and respect entries made by the other.  The file
     name is found by calling 4mXrmSetDatabase24m with the cur-
     rent screen resource database, after preserving the
     original display-associated database, then calling
     4mXtResolvePathname24m with the parameters (4mdisplay24m, NULL,
     NULL, NULL, 4mpath24m, NULL, 0, NULL), where 4mpath24m is defined
     in an operating-system-specific way.  On POSIX-based



			     1m470m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     systems, 4mpath24m is defined to be the value of the envi-
     ronment variable 4mXUSERFILESEARCHPATH24m if this is
     defined.  If 4mXUSERFILESEARCHPATH24m is not defined, an
     implementation-dependent default value is used.  This
     default value is constrained in the following manner:


     -	If the environment variable 4mXAPPLRESDIR24m is not
	defined, the default 4mXUSERFILESEARCHPATH24m must con-
	tain at least six entries.  These entries must con-
	tain $HOME as the directory prefix, plus the follow-
	ing substitutions:

	1. %C, %N, %L  or   %C, %N, %l, %t, %c
	2. %C, %N, %l
	3. %C, %N
	4. %N, %L      or   %N, %l, %t, %c
	5. %N, %l
	6. %N

	The order of these six entries within the path must
	be as given above.  The order and use of substitu-
	tions within a given entry are implementation-depen-
	dent.


     -	If 4mXAPPLRESDIR24m is defined, the default 4mXUSERFILE-0m
	4mSEARCHPATH24m must contain at least seven entries.
	These entries must contain the following directory
	prefixes and substitutions:

	1. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %C, %N, %L or  %C, %N, %l, %t, %c
	2. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %C, %N, %l
	3. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %C, %N
	4. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %N, %L	 or  %N, %l, %t, %c
	5. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %N, %l
	6. $XAPPLRESDIR with  %N
	7. $HOME	with  %N

	The order of these seven entries within the path
	must be as given above.	 The order and use of sub-
	stitutions within a given entry are implementation-
	dependent.


    Last, the application-specific class resource file from
     the local host is merged into the screen resource data-
     base.  This file is owned by the application and is
     usually installed in a system directory when the appli-
     cation is installed.  It may contain sitewide cus-
     tomizations specified by the system manager.  The name
     of the application class resource file is found by
     calling 4mXtResolvePathname24m with the parameters (4mdisplay24m,
     ``app-defaults'', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL).



			     1m480m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     This file is expected to be provided by the developer
     of the application and may be required for the applica-
     tion to function properly.	 A simple application that
     wants to be assured of having a minimal set of
     resources in the absence of its class resource file can
     declare fallback resource specifications with 4mXtAppSet-0m
     4mFallbackResources24m.  Note that the customization substi-
     tution string is retrieved dynamically by 4mXtRe-0m
     4msolvePathname24m so that the resolved file name of the
     application class resource file can be affected by any
     of the earlier sources for the screen resource data-
     base, even though the contents of the class resource
     file have lowest precedence.  After calling 4mXtRe-0m
     4msolvePathname24m, the original display-associated database
     is restored.


To obtain the resource database for a particular screen, use
4mXtScreenDatabase24m.

__
|
XrmDatabase XtScreenDatabase(4mscreen24m)
      Screen *4mscreen24m;


4mscreen24m    Specifies the screen whose resource database is to
	  be returned.
|__

The 4mXtScreenDatabase24m function returns the fully merged
resource database as specified above, associated with the
specified screen.  If the specified 4mscreen24m does not belong
to a 4mDisplay24m initialized by 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m, the results
are undefined.


To obtain the default resource database associated with a
particular display, use 4mXtDatabase24m.

__
|
XrmDatabase XtDatabase(4mdisplay24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display.
|__

The 4mXtDatabase24m function is equivalent to 4mXrmGetDatabase24m.  It
returns the database associated with the specified display,
or NULL if a database has not been set.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To specify a default set of resource values that will be
used to initialize the resource database if no application-
specific class resource file is found (the last of the six
sources listed above), use 4mXtAppSetFallbackResources24m.

__
|
void XtAppSetFallbackResources(4mapp_context24m, 4mspecification_list24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      String *4mspecification_list24m;


4mapp_context24m Specifies the application context in which the
	    fallback specifications will be used.

4mspecification_list0m
	    Specifies a NULL-terminated list of resource
	    specifications to preload the database, or NULL.
|__

Each entry in 4mspecification_list24m points to a string in the
format of 4mXrmPutLineResource24m.  Following a call to 4mXtAppSet-0m
4mFallbackResources24m, when a resource database is being created
for a particular screen and the Intrinsics are not able to
find or read an application-specific class resource file
according to the rules given above and if 4mspecification_list0m
is not NULL, the resource specifications in 4mspecifica-0m
4mtion_list24m will be merged into the screen resource database
in place of the application-specific class resource file.
4mXtAppSetFallbackResources24m is not required to copy 4mspecifica-0m
4mtion_list24m; the caller must ensure that the contents of the
list and of the strings addressed by the list remain valid
until all displays are initialized or until 4mXtAppSetFall-0m
4mbackResources24m is called again.  The value NULL for 4mspecifi-0m
4mcation_list24m removes any previous fallback resource specifi-
cation for the application context.  The intended use for
fallback resources is to provide a minimal number of
resources that will make the application usable (or at least
terminate with helpful diagnostic messages) when some prob-
lem exists in finding and loading the application defaults
file.


1m2.4.	Parsing the Command Line0m

The 4mXtOpenDisplay24m function first parses the command line for
the following options:

-display  Specifies the display name for 4mXOpenDisplay24m.

-name	  Sets the resource name prefix, which overrides the
	  application name passed to 4mXtOpenDisplay24m.





			     1m500m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


-xnllanguage
	  Specifies the initial language string for estab-
	  lishing locale and for finding application class
	  resource files.

4mXtDisplayInitialize24m has a table of standard command line
options that are passed to 4mXrmParseCommand24m for adding
resources to the resource database, and it takes as a param-
eter additional application-specific resource abbreviations.
The format of this table is described in Section 15.9 in
4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.

__
|
typedef enum {
     XrmoptionNoArg,	   /* Value is specified in OptionDescRec.value */
     XrmoptionIsArg,	   /* Value is the option string itself */
     XrmoptionStickyArg,   /* Value is characters immediately following option */
     XrmoptionSepArg,	   /* Value is next argument in argv */
     XrmoptionResArg,	   /* Use the next argument as input to XrmPutLineResource*/
     XrmoptionSkipArg,	   /* Ignore this option and the next argument in argv */
     XrmoptionSkipNArgs,   /* Ignore this option and the next */
			   /* OptionDescRec.value arguments in argv */
     XrmoptionSkipLine	   /* Ignore this option and the rest of argv */
} XrmOptionKind;

typedef struct {
     char *option;	   /* Option name in argv */
     char *specifier;	   /* Resource name (without application name) */
     XrmOptionKind argKind;/* Location of the resource value */
     XPointer value;	   /* Value to provide if XrmoptionNoArg */
} XrmOptionDescRec, *XrmOptionDescList;


|__

The standard table contains the following entries:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Option String	    Resource Name	Argument Kind	Resource Value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-background	    *background		SepArg		next argument
-bd		    *borderColor	SepArg		next argument
-bg		    *background		SepArg		next argument
-borderwidth	    .borderWidth	SepArg		next argument
-bordercolor	    *borderColor	SepArg		next argument
-bw		    .borderWidth	SepArg		next argument
-display	    .display		SepArg		next argument
-fg		    *foreground		SepArg		next argument
-fn		    *font		SepArg		next argument
-font		    *font		SepArg		next argument
-foreground	    *foreground		SepArg		next argument
-geometry	    .geometry		SepArg		next argument




			     1m510m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-iconic		    .iconic		NoArg		``true''
-name		    .name		SepArg		next argument
-reverse	    .reverseVideo	NoArg		``on''
-rv		    .reverseVideo	NoArg		``on''
+rv		    .reverseVideo	NoArg		``off''
-selectionTimeout   .selectionTimeout	SepArg		next argument
-synchronous	    .synchronous	NoArg		``on''

-title		    .title		SepArg		next argument
-xnllanguage	    .xnlLanguage	SepArg		next argument
-xrm		    next argument	ResArg		next argument
-xtsessionID	    .sessionID		SepArg		next argument
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Note that any unique abbreviation for an option name in the
standard table or in the application table is accepted.

If reverseVideo is 4mTrue24m, the values of 4mXtDefaultForeground0m
and 4mXtDefaultBackground24m are exchanged for all screens on the
Display.

The value of the synchronous resource specifies whether or
not Xlib is put into synchronous mode.	If a value is found
in the resource database during display initialization,
4mXtDisplayInitialize24m makes a call to 4mXSynchronize24m for all
display connections currently open in the application con-
text.  Therefore, when multiple displays are initialized in
the same application context, the most recent value speci-
fied for the synchronous resource is used for all displays
in the application context.

The value of the selectionTimeout resource applies to all
displays opened in the same application context.  When mul-
tiple displays are initialized in the same application con-
text, the most recent value specified is used for all dis-
plays in the application context.

The -xrm option provides a method of setting any resource in
an application.	 The next argument should be a quoted string
identical in format to a line in the user resource file.
For example, to give a red background to all command buttons
in an application named 4mxmh24m, you can start it up as


     xmh -xrm 'xmh*Command.background: red'


When it parses the command line, 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m merges
the application option table with the standard option table
before calling the Xlib 4mXrmParseCommand24m function.	An entry
in the application table with the same name as an entry in
the standard table overrides the standard table entry.	If



			     1m520m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


an option name is a prefix of another option name, both
names are kept in the merged table.  The Intrinsics reserve
all option names beginning with the characters ``-xt'' for
future standard uses.


1m2.5.	Creating Widgets0m

The creation of widget instances is a three-phase process:

1.   The widgets are allocated and initialized with
     resources and are optionally added to the managed sub-
     set of their parent.

2.   All composite widgets are notified of their managed
     children in a bottom-up traversal of the widget tree.

3.   The widgets create X windows, which then are mapped.


To start the first phase, the application calls 4mXtCreateWid-0m
4mget24m for all its widgets and adds some (usually, most or all)
of its widgets to their respective parents' managed set by
calling 4mXtManageChild24m.  To avoid an 4mO24m(4mn24m2) creation process
where each composite widget lays itself out each time a wid-
get is created and managed, parent widgets are not notified
of changes in their managed set during this phase.


After all widgets have been created, the application calls
4mXtRealizeWidget24m with the top-level widget to execute the
second and third phases.  4mXtRealizeWidget24m first recursively
traverses the widget tree in a postorder (bottom-up) traver-
sal and then notifies each composite widget with one or more
managed children by means of its change_managed procedure.

Notifying a parent about its managed set involves geometry
layout and possibly geometry negotiation.  A parent deals
with constraints on its size imposed from above (for exam-
ple, when a user specifies the application window size) and
suggestions made from below (for example, when a primitive
child computes its preferred size).  One difference between
the two can cause geometry changes to ripple in both direc-
tions through the widget tree.	The parent may force some of
its children to change size and position and may issue geom-
etry requests to its own parent in order to better accommo-
date all its children.	You cannot predict where anything
will go on the screen until this process finishes.

Consequently, in the first and second phases, no X windows
are actually created, because it is likely that they will
get moved around after creation.  This avoids unnecessary
requests to the X server.




			     1m530m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Finally, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m starts the third phase by making a
preorder (top-down) traversal of the widget tree, allocates
an X window to each widget by means of its realize proce-
dure, and finally maps the widgets that are managed.


1m2.5.1.  Creating and Merging Argument Lists0m

Many Intrinsics functions may be passed pairs of resource
names and values.  These are passed as an arglist, a pointer
to an array of 4mArg24m structures, which contains

__
|
typedef struct {
     String name;
     XtArgVal value;
} Arg, *ArgList;

|__

where 4mXtArgVal24m is as defined in Section 1.5.

If the size of the resource is less than or equal to the
size of an 4mXtArgVal24m, the resource value is stored directly
in 4mvalue24m; otherwise, a pointer to it is stored in 4mvalue24m.

To set values in an 4mArgList24m, use 4mXtSetArg24m.

__
|
void XtSetArg(4marg24m, 4mname24m, 4mvalue24m)
      Arg 4marg24m;
      String 4mname24m;
      XtArgVal 4mvalue24m;


4marg24m       Specifies the 4mname/value24m pair to set.

4mname24m      Specifies the name of the resource.

4mvalue24m     Specifies the value of the resource if it will fit
	  in an 4mXtArgVal24m, else the address.
|__

The 4mXtSetArg24m function is usually used in a highly stylized
manner to minimize the probability of making a mistake; for
example:


     Arg args[20];
     int n;

     n = 0;



			     1m540m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     XtSetArg(args[n], XtNheight, 100);n++;
     XtSetArg(args[n], XtNwidth, 200);n++;
     XtSetValues(widget, args, n);


Alternatively, an application can statically declare the
argument list and use 4mXtNumber24m:


     static Args args[] = {
	  {XtNheight, (XtArgVal) 100},
	  {XtNwidth, (XtArgVal) 200},
     };
     XtSetValues(Widget, args, XtNumber(args));


Note that you should not use expressions with side effects
such as auto-increment or auto-decrement within the first
argument to 4mXtSetArg24m.  4mXtSetArg24m can be implemented as a
macro that evaluates the first argument twice.


To merge two arglist arrays, use 4mXtMergeArgLists24m.

__
|
ArgList XtMergeArgLists(4margs124m, 4mnum_args124m, 4margs224m, 4mnum_args224m)
     ArgList 4margs124m;
     Cardinal 4mnum_args124m;
     ArgList 4margs224m;
     Cardinal 4mnum_args224m;


4margs124m     Specifies the first argument list.

4mnum_args124m Specifies the number of entries in the first argu-
	  ment list.

4margs224m     Specifies the second argument list.

4mnum_args224m Specifies the number of entries in the second
	  argument list.
|__

The 4mXtMergeArgLists24m function allocates enough storage to
hold the combined arglist arrays and copies them into it.
Note that it does not check for duplicate entries.  The
length of the returned list is the sum of the lengths of the
specified lists.  When it is no longer needed, free the
returned storage by using 4mXtFree24m.


All Intrinsics interfaces that require 4mArgList24m arguments
have analogs conforming to the ANSI C variable argument list



			     1m550m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


(traditionally called ``varargs'') calling convention.	The
name of the analog is formed by prefixing ``Va'' to the name
of the corresponding 4mArgList24m procedure; e.g., 4mXtVaCreateWid-0m
4mget24m.  Each procedure named 1mXtVa4m22msomething24m takes as its last
arguments, in place of the corresponding 4mArgList24m/ 4mCardinal0m
parameters, a variable parameter list of resource name and
value pairs where each name is of type 4mString24m and each value
is of type 4mXtArgVal24m.  The end of the list is identified by a
4mname24m entry containing NULL.  Developers writing in the C
language wishing to pass resource name and value pairs to
any of these interfaces may use the 4mArgList24m and varargs
forms interchangeably.

Two special names are defined for use only in varargs lists:
4mXtVaTypedArg24m and 4mXtVaNestedList24m.


__
|
#define XtVaTypedArg "XtVaTypedArg"

|__

If the name 4mXtVaTypedArg24m is specified in place of a resource
name, then the following four arguments are interpreted as a
4mname/type/value/size24m tuple 4mwhere24m name is of type 4mString24m,
4mtype24m is of type 4mString24m, 4mvalue24m is of type 4mXtArgVal24m, and 4msize0m
is of type int.	 When a varargs list containing 4mXtVaTypedArg0m
is processed, a resource type conversion (see Section 9.6)
is performed if necessary to convert the value into the for-
mat required by the associated resource.  If 4mtype24m is
XtRString, then 4mvalue24m contains a pointer to the string and
4msize24m contains the number of bytes allocated, including the
trailing null byte.  If 4mtype24m is not XtRString, then 4mif24m size
is less than or equal to 1msizeof22m(1mXtArgVal22m), the value should
be the data cast to the type 4mXtArgVal24m, otherwise 4mvalue24m is a
pointer to the data.  If the type conversion fails for any
reason, a warning message is issued and the list entry is
skipped.


__
|
#define XtVaNestedList	"XtVaNestedList"

|__

If the name 4mXtVaNestedList24m is specified in place of a
resource name, then the following argument is interpreted as
an 4mXtVarArgsList24m value, which specifies another varargs list
that is logically inserted into the original list at the
point of declaration.  The end of the nested list is identi-
fied with a name entry containing NULL.	 Varargs lists may
nest to any depth.



			     1m560m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To dynamically allocate a varargs list for use with
4mXtVaNestedList24m in multiple calls, use 4mXtVaCreateArgsList24m.


__
|
typedef XtPointer XtVarArgsList;



XtVarArgsList XtVaCreateArgsList(4munused24m, ...)
      XtPointer 4munused24m;


4munused24m    This argument is not currently used and must be
	  specified as NULL.

...	  Specifies a variable parameter list of resource
	  name and value pairs.
|__

The 4mXtVaCreateArgsList24m function allocates memory and copies
its arguments into a single list pointer, which may be used
with 4mXtVaNestedList24m.  The end of both lists is identified by
a 4mname24m entry containing NULL.  Any entries of type 4mXtVaType-0m
4mdArg24m are copied as specified without applying conversions.
Data passed by reference (including Strings) are not copied,
only the pointers themselves; the caller must ensure that
the data remain valid for the lifetime of the created
varargs list.  The list should be freed using 4mXtFree24m when no
longer needed.

Use of resource files and of the resource database is gener-
ally encouraged over lengthy arglist or varargs lists when-
ever possible in order to permit modification without recom-
pilation.


1m2.5.2.  Creating a Widget Instance0m

To create an instance of a widget, use 4mXtCreateWidget24m.
















			     1m570m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Widget XtCreateWidget(4mname24m, 4mobject_class24m, 4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      String 4mname24m;
      WidgetClass 4mobject_class24m;
      Widget 4mparent24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the resource instance name for the cre-
	  ated widget, which is used for retrieving
	  resources and, for that reason, should not be the
	  same as any other widget that is a child of the
	  same parent.

4mobject_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class pointer for the created
	  object.  Must be 1mobjectClass 22mor any subclass
	  thereof.

4mparent24m    Specifies the parent widget.  Must be of class
	  Object or any subclass thereof.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list to override any other
	  resource specifications.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

The 4mXtCreateWidget24m function performs all the boilerplate
operations of widget creation, doing the following in order:

    Checks to see if the class_initialize procedure has
     been called for this class and for all superclasses
     and, if not, calls those necessary in a superclass-to-
     subclass order.

    If the specified class is not 4mcoreWidgetClass24m or a sub-
     class thereof, and the parent's class is a subclass of
     4mcompositeWidgetClass24m and either no extension record in
     the parent's composite class part extension field
     exists with the 4mrecord_type24m 4mNULLQUARK24m or the
     4maccepts_objects24m field in the extension record is 4mFalse24m,
     4mXtCreateWidget24m issues a fatal error; see Section 3.1
     and Chapter 12.

    If the specified class contains an extension record in
     the object class part 4mextension24m field with 4mrecord_type0m
     4mNULLQUARK24m and the 4mallocate24m field is not NULL, the pro-
     cedure is invoked to allocate memory for the widget
     instance.	If the parent is a member of the class 4mcon-0m
     4mstraintWidgetClass24m, the procedure also allocates memory
     for the parent's constraints and stores the address of



			     1m580m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     this memory into the 4mconstraints24m field.  If no allocate
     procedure is found, the Intrinsics allocate memory for
     the widget and, when applicable, the constraints, and
     initializes the 4mconstraints24m field.

    Initializes the Core nonresource data fields 4mself24m, 4mpar-0m
     4ment24m, 4mwidget_class24m, 4mbeing_destroyed24m, 4mname24m, 4mmanaged24m, 4mwin-0m
     4mdow24m, 4mvisible24m, 4mpopup_list24m, and 4mnum_popups24m.

    Initializes the resource fields (for example, 4mback-0m
     4mground_pixel24m) by using the 4mCoreClassPart24m resource lists
     specified for this class and all superclasses.

    If the parent is a member of the class 4mconstraintWid-0m
     4mgetClass24m, initializes the resource fields of the con-
     straints record by using the 4mConstraintClassPart0m
     resource lists specified for the parent's class and all
     superclasses up to 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m.

    Calls the initialize procedures for the widget starting
     at the Object initialize procedure on down to the wid-
     get's initialize procedure.

    If the parent is a member of the class 4mconstraintWid-0m
     4mgetClass24m, calls the 4mConstraintClassPart24m initialize pro-
     cedures, starting at 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m on down to
     the parent's 4mConstraintClassPart24m initialize procedure.

    If the parent is a member of the class 4mcompositeWidget-0m
     4mClass24m, puts the widget into its parent's children list
     by calling its parent's insert_child procedure.  For
     further information, see Section 3.1.


To create an instance of a widget using varargs lists, use
4mXtVaCreateWidget24m.

      Widget 4mparent24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the resource name for the created wid-

The 4mXtVaCreateWidget24m procedure is identical in function to
4mXtCreateWidget24m with the 4margs24m and 4mnum_args24m parameters
replaced by a varargs list, as described in Section 2.5.1.


1m2.5.3.  Creating an Application Shell Instance0m

An application can have multiple top-level widgets, each of
which specifies a unique widget tree that can potentially be
on different screens or displays.  An application uses 4mXtAp-0m
4mpCreateShell24m to create independent widget trees.

4mname24m	 Specifies the instance name of the shell widget.
	    If 4mname24m is NULL, the application name passed to

	    subclass thereof.

4mwidget_class0m

|__

The 4mXtAppCreateShell24m function creates a new shell widget
instance as the root of a widget tree.	The screen resource
for this widget is determined by first scanning 4margs24m for the
XtNscreen argument.  If no XtNscreen argument is found, the
resource database associated with the default screen of the
specified display is queried for the resource 4mname24m.screen,
class 4mClass24m.Screen where 4mClass24m is the specified 4mapplica-0m
4mtion_class24m if 4mwidget_class24m is 4mapplicationShellWidgetClass24m or
a subclass thereof.  If 4mwidget_class24m is not 4mapplication-0m
4mShellWidgetClass24m or a subclass, 4mClass24m is the 4mclass_name0m
field from the 4mCoreClassPart24m of the specified 4mwidget_class24m.
If this query fails, the default screen of the specified
display is used.  Once the screen is determined, the
resource database associated with that screen is used to
retrieve all remaining resources for the shell widget not
specified in 4margs24m.	 The widget name and 4mClass24m as determined
above are used as the leftmost (i.e., root) components in
all fully qualified resource names for objects within this
widget tree.

If the specified widget class is a subclass of WMShell, the
name and 4mClass24m as determined above will be stored into the
4mWM_CLASS24m property on the widget's window when it becomes
realized.  If the specified 4mwidget_class24m is 4mapplication-0m
4mShellWidgetClass24m or a subclass thereof, the 4mWM_COMMAND24m prop-
erty will also be set from the values of the XtNargv and
XtNargc resources.


To create multiple top-level shells within a single (logi-
cal) application, you can use one of two methods:

    Designate one shell as the real top-level shell and
     create the others as pop-up children of it by using
     4mXtCreatePopupShell24m.

    Have all shells as pop-up children of an unrealized
     top-level shell.

The first method, which is best used when there is a clear
choice for what is the main window, leads to resource speci-
fications like the following:


     xmail.geometry:...	 (the main window)
     xmail.read.geometry:...(the read window)
     xmail.compose.geometry:...(the compose window)


The second method, which is best if there is no main window,
leads to resource specifications like the following:


     xmail.headers.geometry:...(the headers window)
     xmail.read.geometry:...(the read window)
     xmail.compose.geometry:...(the compose window)



To create a top-level widget that is the root of a widget
tree using varargs lists, use 4mXtVaAppCreateShell24m.

4mrecord_type24m equal to 4mNULLQUARK24m is located through the object
class part 4mextension24m field and the 4mallocate24m field is not
NULL, the 4mXtAllocateProc24m will be invoked to allocate memory
for the widget.	 If no ObjectClassPart extension record is
declared with 4mrecord_type24m 4mequal24m to 4mNULLQUARK24m, then 4mXtInheri-0m
4mtAllocate24m and 4mXtInheritDeallocate24m are assumed.  If no 4mXtAl-0m
4mlocateProc24m is found, the Intrinsics will allocate memory for
the widget.





			     1m680m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


An 4mXtAllocateProc24m must perform the following:

    Allocate memory for the widget instance and return it
     in 4mnew_return24m.  The memory must be at least
     4mwc->core_class.widget_size24m bytes in length, double-word
     aligned.

    Initialize the 4mcore.constraints24m field in the instance
     record to NULL or to point to a constraint record.	 If
     4mconstraint_size24m is not 0, the procedure must allocate
     memory for the constraint record.	The memory must be
     double-word aligned.

    If 4mmore_bytes24m is not 0, then the address of a block of
     memory at least 4mmore_bytes24m in size, double-word
     aligned, must be returned in the 4mmore_bytes_return0m
     parameter, or NULL to indicate an error.

A class allocation procedure that envelops the allocation
procedure of a superclass must rely on the enveloped proce-
dure to perform the instance and constraint allocation.
Allocation procedures should refrain from initializing
fields in the widget record except to store pointers to
newly allocated additional memory.  Under no circumstances
should an allocation procedure that envelopes its superclass
allocation procedure modify fields in the instance part of
any superclass.


1m2.5.6.  Widget Instance Initialization: The initialize Pro-0m
1mcedure0m

The initialize procedure pointer in a widget class is of
type 4mXtInitProc24m.























			     1m690m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtInitProc)(Widget, Widget, ArgList, Cardinal*);
      Widget 4mrequest24m;
      Widget 4mnew24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_args24m;


4mrequest24m   Specifies a copy of the widget with resource val-
	  ues as requested by the argument list, the
	  resource database, and the widget defaults.

4mnew24m       Specifies the widget with the new values, both
	  resource and nonresource, that are actually
	  allowed.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list passed by the client,
	  for computing derived resource values.  If the
	  client created the widget using a varargs form,
	  any resources specified via 4mXtVaTypedArg24m are con-
	  verted to the widget representation and the list
	  is transformed into the 4mArgList24m format.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

An initialization procedure performs the following:

    Allocates space for and copies any resources referenced
     by address that the client is allowed to free or modify
     after the widget has been created.	 For example, if a
     widget has a field that is a 4mString24m, it may choose not
     to depend on the characters at that address remaining
     constant but dynamically allocate space for the string
     and copy it to the new space.  Widgets that do not copy
     one or more resources referenced by address should
     clearly so state in their user documentation.

			      Note

	  It is not necessary to allocate space for or
	  to copy callback lists.


    Computes values for unspecified resource fields.  For
     example, if 4mwidth24m and 4mheight24m are zero, the widget
     should compute an appropriate width and height based on
     its other resources.








			     1m700m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


			      Note

	  A widget may directly assign only its own
	  4mwidth24m and 4mheight24m within the initialize, ini-
	  tialize_hook, set_values, and set_values_hook
	  procedures; see Chapter 6.


    Computes values for uninitialized nonresource fields
     that are derived from resource fields.  For example,
     graphics contexts (GCs) that the widget uses are
     derived from resources like background, foreground, and
     font.

An initialization procedure also can check certain fields
for internal consistency.  For example, it makes no sense to
specify a colormap for a depth that does not support that
colormap.

Initialization procedures are called in superclass-to-sub-
class order after all fields specified in the resource lists
have been initialized.	The initialize procedure does not
need to examine 4margs24m and 4mnum_args24m if all public resources
are declared in the resource list.  Most of the initializa-
tion code for a specific widget class deals with fields
defined in that class and not with fields defined in its
superclasses.

If a subclass does not need an initialization procedure
because it does not need to perform any of the above opera-
tions, it can specify NULL for the 4minitialize24m field in the
class record.

Sometimes a subclass may want to overwrite values filled in
by its superclass.  In particular, size calculations of a
superclass often are incorrect for a subclass, and in this
case, the subclass must modify or recalculate fields
declared and computed by its superclass.

As an example, a subclass can visually surround its super-
class display.	In this case, the width and height calcu-
lated by the superclass initialize procedure are too small
and need to be incremented by the size of the surround.	 The
subclass needs to know if its superclass's size was calcu-
lated by the superclass or was specified explicitly.  All
widgets must place themselves into whatever size is explic-
itly given, but they should compute a reasonable size if no
size is requested.

The 4mrequest24m and 4mnew24m arguments provide the necessary informa-
tion for a subclass to determine the difference between an
explicitly specified field and a field computed by a super-
class.	The 4mrequest24m widget is a copy of the widget as ini-
tialized by the arglist and resource database.	The 4mnew0m



			     1m710m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


widget starts with the values in the request, but it has
been updated by all superclass initialization procedures
called so far.	A subclass initialize procedure can compare
these two to resolve any potential conflicts.

In the above example, the subclass with the visual surround
can see if the 4mwidth24m and 4mheight24m in the 4mrequest24m widget are
zero.  If so, it adds its surround size to the 4mwidth24m and
4mheight24m fields in the 4mnew24m widget.  If not, it must make do
with the size originally specified.

The 4mnew24m widget will become the actual widget instance
record.	 Therefore, the initialization procedure should do
all its work on the 4mnew24m widget; the 4mrequest24m widget should
never be modified.  If the initialize procedure needs to
call any routines that operate on a widget, it should spec-
ify 4mnew24m as the widget instance.


1m2.5.7.  Constraint Instance Initialization: The Constraint-0m
1mClassPart initialize Procedure0m

The constraint initialization procedure pointer, found in
the 4mConstraintClassPart24m 4minitialize24m field of the widget class
record, is of type 4mXtInitProc24m.  The values passed to the
parent constraint initialization procedures are the same as
those passed to the child's class widget initialization pro-
cedures.

The 4mconstraints24m field of the 4mrequest24m widget points to a copy
of the constraints record as initialized by the arglist and
resource database.

The constraint initialization procedure should compute any
constraint fields derived from constraint resources.  It can
make further changes to the 4mnew24m widget to make the widget
and any other constraint fields conform to the specified
constraints, for example, changing the widget's size or
position.

If a constraint class does not need a constraint initializa-
tion procedure, it can specify NULL for the 4minitialize24m field
of the 4mConstraintClassPart24m in the class record.


1m2.5.8.  Nonwidget Data Initialization: The initialize_hook0m
1mProcedure0m










			     1m720m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


			    Note

     The initialize_hook procedure is obsolete, as the
     same information is now available to the initial-
     ize procedure.  The procedure has been retained
     for those widgets that used it in previous
     releases.


The initialize_hook procedure pointer is of type 4mXtArgsProc24m:

__
|
typedef void (*XtArgsProc)(Widget, ArgList, Cardinal*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_args24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list passed by the client.
	  If the client created the widget using a varargs
	  form, any resources specified via 4mXtVaTypedArg24m are
	  converted to the widget representation and the
	  list is transformed into the 4mArgList24m format.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

If this procedure is not NULL, it is called immediately
after the corresponding initialize procedure or in its place
if the 4minitialize24m field is NULL.

The initialize_hook procedure allows a widget instance to
initialize nonresource data using information from the spec-
ified argument list as if it were a resource.


1m2.6.	Realizing Widgets0m

To realize a widget instance, use 4mXtRealizeWidget24m.

__
|
void XtRealizeWidget(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
     |__  any subclass thereof.





			     1m730m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


If the widget is already realized, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m simply
returns.  Otherwise it performs the following:

    Binds all action names in the widget's translation ta-
     ble to procedures (see Section 10.1.2).

    Makes a postorder traversal of the widget tree rooted
     at the specified widget and calls each non-NULL
     change_managed procedure of all composite widgets that
     have one or more managed children.

    Constructs an 4mXSetWindowAttributes24m structure filled in
     with information derived from the Core widget fields
     and calls the realize procedure for the widget, which
     adds any widget-specific attributes and creates the X
     window.

    If the widget is not a subclass of 4mcompositeWidget-0m
     4mClass24m, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m returns; otherwise it continues
     and performs the following:

     -	  Descends recursively to each of the widget's man-
	  aged children and calls the realize procedures.
	  Primitive widgets that instantiate children are
	  responsible for realizing those children them-
	  selves.

     -	  Maps all of the managed children windows that have
	  4mmapped_when_managed24m 4mTrue24m.  If a widget is managed
	  but 4mmapped_when_managed24m is 4mFalse24m, the widget is
	  allocated visual space but is not displayed.

If the widget is a top-level shell widget (that is, it has
no parent), and 4mmapped_when_managed24m is 4mTrue24m, 4mXtRealizeWidget0m
maps the widget window.

4mXtCreateWidget24m, 4mXtVaCreateWidget24m, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m, 4mXtMan-0m
4mageChildren24m, 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m, 4mXtUnrealizeWidget24m,
4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m, and 4mXtDestroyWidget24m maintain the
following invariants:

    If a composite widget is realized, then all its managed
     children are realized.

    If a composite widget is realized, then all its managed
     children that have 4mmapped_when_managed24m 4mTrue24m are mapped.

All Intrinsics functions and all widget routines should
accept either realized or unrealized widgets.  When calling
the realize or change_managed procedures for children of a
composite widget, 4mXtRealizeWidget24m calls the procedures in
reverse order of appearance in the 4mCompositePart24m 4mchildren0m
list.  By default, this ordering of the realize procedures
will result in the stacking order of any newly created



			     1m740m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


subwindows being top-to-bottom in the order of appearance on
the list, and the most recently created child will be at the
bottom.


To check whether or not a widget has been realized, use
4mXtIsRealized24m.

__

Boolean XtIsRealized(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or

The 4mXtIsRealized24m function returns 4mTrue24m if the widget has
been realized, that is, if the widget has a nonzero window
ID.  If the specified object is not a widget, the state of
the nearest widget ancestor is returned.

Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might wish
to operate differently after the widget has been realized.


1m2.6.1.  Widget Instance Window Creation: The realize Proce-0m

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Before calling the class realize procedure, the generic
4mXtRealizeWidget24m function fills in a mask and a corresponding
4mXSetWindowAttributes24m structure.  It sets the following
fields in 4mattributes24m and corresponding bits in 4mvalue_mask0m
based on information in the widget core structure:

    The 4mbackground_pixmap24m (or 4mbackground_pixel24m if 4mback-0m
     4mground_pixmap24m is 4mXtUnspecifiedPixmap24m) is filled in from
     the corresponding field.

    The 4mborder_pixmap24m (or 4mborder_pixel24m if 4mborder_pixmap24m is
     4mXtUnspecifiedPixmap24m) is filled in from the correspond-
     ing field.

    The 4mcolormap24m is filled in from the corresponding field.

    The 4mevent_mask24m is filled in based on the event handlers
     registered, the event translations specified, whether
     the 4mexpose24m field is non-NULL, and whether 4mvisi-0m
     4mble_interest24m is 4mTrue24m.

    The 4mbit_gravity24m is set to 4mNorthWestGravity24m if the
     4mexpose24m field is NULL.

These or any other fields in attributes and the correspond-
ing bits in 4mvalue_mask24m can be set by the realize procedure.

Note that because realize is not a chained operation, the
widget class realize procedure must update the 4mXSetWindowAt-0m
4mtributes24m structure with all the appropriate fields from non-
Core superclasses.

A widget class can inherit its realize procedure from its
superclass during class initialization.	 The realize proce-
dure defined for 4mcoreWidgetClass24m calls 4mXtCreateWindow24m with
the passed 4mvalue_mask24m and 4mattributes24m and with 4mwindow_class0m
and 4mvisual24m set to 4mCopyFromParent24m.  Both 4mcompositeWidgetClass0m
and 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m inherit this realize procedure,
and most new widget subclasses can do the same (see Section
1.6.10).

The most common noninherited realize procedures set
4mbit_gravity24m in the mask and attributes to the appropriate
value and then create the window.  For example, depending on
its justification, Label might set 4mbit_gravity24m to 4mWestGrav-0m
4mity24m, 4mCenterGravity24m, or 4mEastGravity24m.  Consequently, shrinking
it would just move the bits appropriately, and no exposure
event is needed for repainting.

If a composite widget's children should be realized in an
order other than that specified (to control the stacking
order, for example), it should call 4mXtRealizeWidget24m on its
children itself in the appropriate order from within its own
realize procedure.



			     1m760m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Widgets that have children and whose class is not a subclass
of 4mcompositeWidgetClass24m are responsible for calling 4mXtReal-0m
4mizeWidget24m on their children, usually from within the realize
procedure.

Realize procedures cannot manage or unmanage their descen-
dants.


1m2.6.2.  Window Creation Convenience Routine0m

Rather than call the Xlib 4mXCreateWindow24m function explicitly,
a realize procedure should normally call the Intrinsics ana-
log 4mXtCreateWindow24m, which simplifies the creation of windows
for widgets.

__
|
void XtCreateWindow(4mw24m, 4mwindow_class24m, 4mvisual24m, 4mvalue_mask24m, 4mattributes24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      unsigned int 4mwindow_class24m;
      Visual *4mvisual24m;
      XtValueMask 4mvalue_mask24m;
      XSetWindowAttributes *4mattributes24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that defines the additional
	  window attributed.  Must be of class Core or any
	  subclass thereof.

4mwindow_class0m
	  Specifies the Xlib window class (for example,
	  4mInputOutput24m, 4mInputOnly24m, or 4mCopyFromParent24m).

4mvisual24m    Specifies the visual type (usually 4mCopyFromPar-0m
	  4ment24m).

4mvalue_mask0m
	  Specifies which fields in the 4mattributes24m structure
	  are used.

4mattributes0m
	  Specifies the window attributes to use in the
	  4mXCreateWindow24m call.
|__

The 4mXtCreateWindow24m function calls the Xlib 4mXCreateWindow0m
function with values from the widget structure and the
passed parameters.  Then, it assigns the created window to
the widget's 4mwindow24m field.

4mXtCreateWindow24m evaluates the following fields of the widget
core structure: 4mdepth24m, 4mscreen24m, 4mparent->core.window24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m,
4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m2.7.	Obtaining Window Information from a Widget0m

The Core widget class definition contains the screen and
window ids.  The 4mwindow24m field may be NULL for a while (see
Sections 2.5 and 2.6).

The display pointer, the parent widget, screen pointer, and
window of a widget are available to the widget writer by
means of macros and to the application writer by means of
functions.

__
|
Display *XtDisplay(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtDisplay24m returns the display pointer for the specified wid-
get.


__
|
Widget XtParent(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtParent24m returns the parent object for the specified widget.
The returned object will be of class Object or a subclass.


__
|
Screen *XtScreen(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtScreen24m returns the screen pointer for the specified wid-
get.






			     1m780m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Window XtWindow(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtWindow24m returns the window of the specified widget.


The display pointer, screen pointer, and window of a widget
or of the closest widget ancestor of a nonwidget object are
available by means of 4mXtDisplayOfObject24m, 4mXtScreenOfObject24m,
and 4mXtWindowOfObject24m.


__
|
Display *XtDisplayOfObject(4mobject24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies the object.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtDisplayOfObject24m is identical in function to 4mXtDisplay24m if
the object is a widget; otherwise 4mXtDisplayOfObject24m returns
the display pointer for the nearest ancestor of 4mobject24m that
is of class Widget or a subclass thereof.

__
|
Screen *XtScreenOfObject(4mobject24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies the object.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtScreenOfObject24m is identical in function to 4mXtScreen24m if the
object is a widget; otherwise 4mXtScreenOfObject24m returns the
screen pointer for the nearest ancestor of 4mobject24m that is of
class Widget or a subclass thereof.










			     1m790m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Window XtWindowOfObject(4mobject24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies the object.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtWindowOfObject24m is identical in function to 4mXtWindow24m if the
object is a widget; otherwise 4mXtWindowOfObject24m returns the
window for the nearest ancestor of 4mobject24m that is of class
Widget or a subclass thereof.


To retrieve the instance name of an object, use 4mXtName24m.

__
|
String XtName(4mobject24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies the object whose name is desired.  Must
	  be of class Object or any subclass thereof.
|__

4mXtName24m returns a pointer to the instance name of the speci-
fied object.  The storage is owned by the Intrinsics and
must not be modified.  The name is not qualified by the
names of any of the object's ancestors.

Several window attributes are locally cached in the widget
instance.  Thus, they can be set by the resource manager and
4mXtSetValues24m as well as used by routines that derive struc-
tures from these values (for example, 4mdepth24m for deriving
pixmaps, 4mbackground_pixel24m for deriving GCs, and so on) or in
the 4mXtCreateWindow24m call.

The 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m window attributes
are available to geometry managers.  These fields are main-
tained synchronously inside the Intrinsics.  When an 4mXCon-0m
4mfigureWindow24m is issued by the Intrinsics on the widget's
window (on request of its parent), these values are updated
immediately rather than some time later when the server gen-
erates a 4mConfigureNotify24m event.  (In fact, most widgets do
not select 4mSubstructureNotify24m events.)  This ensures that
all geometry calculations are based on the internally con-
sistent toolkit world rather than on either an inconsistent
world updated by asynchronous 4mConfigureNotify24m events or a
consistent, but slow, world in which geometry managers ask
the server for window sizes whenever they need to lay out
their managed children (see Chapter 6).

1m2.7.1.  Unrealizing Widgets0m

To destroy the windows associated with a widget and its non-
pop-up descendants, use 4mXtUnrealizeWidget24m.

__
|
void XtUnrealizeWidget(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

If the widget is currently unrealized, 4mXtUnrealizeWidget0m
simply returns.	 Otherwise it performs the following:

    Unmanages the widget if the widget is managed.

    Makes a postorder (child-to-parent) traversal of the
     widget tree rooted at the specified widget and, for
     each widget that has declared a callback list resource
     named ``unrealizeCallback'', executes the procedures on
     the XtNunrealizeCallback list.

    Destroys the widget's window and any subwindows by
     calling 4mXDestroyWindow24m with the specified widget's 4mwin-0m
     4mdow24m field.

Any events in the queue or which arrive following a call to
4mXtUnrealizeWidget24m will be dispatched as if the window(s) of
the unrealized widget(s) had never existed.


1m2.8.	Destroying Widgets0m

The Intrinsics provide support

    To destroy all the pop-up children of the widget being
     destroyed and destroy all children of composite wid-
     gets.

    To remove (and unmap) the widget from its parent.

    To call the callback procedures that have been regis-
     tered to trigger when the widget is destroyed.

    To minimize the number of things a widget has to deal-
     locate when destroyed.

    To minimize the number of 4mXDestroyWindow24m calls when
     destroying a widget tree.




			     1m810m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To destroy a widget instance, use 4mXtDestroyWidget24m.

__
|
void XtDestroyWidget(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtDestroyWidget24m function provides the only method of
destroying a widget, including widgets that need to destroy
themselves.  It can be called at any time, including from an
application callback routine of the widget being destroyed.
This requires a two-phase destroy process in order to avoid
dangling references to destroyed widgets.

In phase 1, 4mXtDestroyWidget24m performs the following:

    If the 4mbeing_destroyed24m field of the widget is 4mTrue24m, it
     returns immediately.

    Recursively descends the widget tree and sets the
     4mbeing_destroyed24m field to 4mTrue24m for the widget and all
     normal and pop-up children.

    Adds the widget to a list of widgets (the destroy list)
     that should be destroyed when it is safe to do so.

Entries on the destroy list satisfy the invariant that if w2
occurs after w1 on the destroy list, then w2 is not a
descendent, either normal or pop-up, of w1.

Phase 2 occurs when all procedures that should execute as a
result of the current event have been called, including all
procedures registered with the event and translation man-
agers, that is, when the current invocation of 4mXtDis-0m
4mpatchEvent24m is about to return, or immediately if not in
4mXtDispatchEvent24m.

In phase 2, 4mXtDestroyWidget24m performs the following on each
entry in the destroy list in the order specified:

    If the widget is not a pop-up child and the widget's
     parent is a subclass of 4mcompositeWidgetClass24m, and if
     the parent is not being destroyed, it calls 4mXtUnman-0m
     4mageChild24m on the widget and then calls the widget's par-
     ent's delete_child procedure (see Section 3.3).

    Calls the destroy callback procedures registered on the
     widget and all normal and pop-up descendants in pos-
     torder (it calls child callbacks before parent



			     1m820m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     callbacks).

The 4mXtDestroyWidget24m function then makes second traversal of
the widget and all normal and pop-up descendants to perform
the following three items on each widget in postorder:

    If the widget is not a pop-up child and the widget's
     parent is a subclass of 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m, it calls
     the 4mConstraintClassPart24m destroy procedure for the par-
     ent, then for the parent's superclass, until finally it
     calls the 4mConstraintClassPart24m destroy procedure for
     4mconstraintWidgetClass24m.

    Calls the 4mCoreClassPart24m destroy procedure declared in
     the widget class, then the destroy procedure declared
     in its superclass, until finally it calls the destroy
     procedure declared in the Object class record.  Call-
     back lists are deallocated.

    If the widget class object class part contains an
     4mObjectClassExtension24m record with the record_type 4mNUL-0m
     4mLQUARK24m and the 4mdeallocate24m field is not NULL, calls the
     deallocate procedure to deallocate the instance and if
     one exists, the constraint record.	 Otherwise, the
     Intrinsics will deallocate the widget instance record
     and if one exists, the constraint record.

    Calls 4mXDestroyWindow24m if the specified widget is real-
     ized (that is, has an X window).  The server recur-
     sively destroys all normal descendant windows.  (Win-
     dows of realized pop-up Shell children, and their
     descendants, are destroyed by a shell class destroy
     procedure.)


1m2.8.1.  Adding and Removing Destroy Callbacks0m

When an application needs to perform additional processing
during the destruction of a widget, it should register a
destroy callback procedure for the widget.  The destroy
callback procedures use the mechanism described in Chapter
8.  The destroy callback list is identified by the resource
name XtNdestroyCallback.

For example, the following adds an application-supplied
destroy callback procedure 4mClientDestroy24m with client data to
a widget by calling 4mXtAddCallback24m.

     XtAddCallback(4mw24m, XtNdestroyCallback, 4mClientDestroy24m, 4mclient_data24m)


Similarly, the following removes the application-supplied
destroy callback procedure 4mClientDestroy24m by calling
4mXtRemoveCallback24m.



			     1m830m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     XtRemoveCallback(4mw24m, XtNdestroyCallback, 4mClientDestroy24m, 4mclient_data24m)


The 4mClientDestroy24m argument is of type 4mXtCallbackProc24m; see
Section 8.1.


1m2.8.2.  Dynamic Data Deallocation: The destroy Procedure0m

The destroy procedure pointers in the 4mObjectClassPart24m, 4mRec-0m
4mtObjClassPart24m, and 4mCoreClassPart24m structures are of type
4mXtWidgetProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtWidgetProc)(Widget);
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget being destroyed.
|__

The destroy procedures are called in subclass-to-superclass
order.	Therefore, a widget's destroy procedure should deal-
locate only storage that is specific to the subclass and
should ignore the storage allocated by any of its super-
classes.  The destroy procedure should deallocate only
resources that have been explicitly created by the subclass.
Any resource that was obtained from the resource database or
passed in an argument list was not created by the widget and
therefore should not be destroyed by it.  If a widget does
not need to deallocate any storage, the destroy procedure
entry in its class record can be NULL.

Deallocating storage includes, but is not limited to, the
following steps:

    Calling 4mXtFree24m on dynamic storage allocated with 4mXtMal-0m
     4mloc24m, 4mXtCalloc24m, and so on.

    Calling 4mXFreePixmap24m on pixmaps created with direct X
     calls.

    Calling 4mXtReleaseGC24m on GCs allocated with 4mXtGetGC24m.

    Calling 4mXFreeGC24m on GCs allocated with direct X calls.

    Calling 4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m on event handlers added to
     other widgets.

    Calling 4mXtRemoveTimeOut24m on timers created with 4mXtAppAd-0m
     4mdTimeOut24m.





			     1m840m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Calling 4mXtDestroyWidget24m for each child if the widget
     has children and is not a subclass of 4mcompositeWidget-0m
     4mClass24m.

During destroy phase 2 for each widget, the Intrinsics
remove the widget from the modal cascade, unregister all
event handlers, remove all key, keyboard, button, and
pointer grabs and remove all callback procedures registered
on the widget.	Any outstanding selection transfers will
time out.


1m2.8.3.  Dynamic Constraint Data Deallocation: The Con-0m
1mstraintClassPart destroy Procedure0m

The constraint destroy procedure identified in the 4mCon-0m
4mstraintClassPart24m structure is called for a widget whose par-
ent is a subclass of 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m.  This constraint
destroy procedure pointer is of type 4mXtWidgetProc24m.	 The con-
straint destroy procedures are called in subclass-to-super-
class order, starting at the class of the widget's parent
and ending at 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m.  Therefore, a parent's
constraint destroy procedure should deallocate only storage
that is specific to the constraint subclass and not storage
allocated by any of its superclasses.

If a parent does not need to deallocate any constraint stor-
age, the constraint destroy procedure entry in its class
record can be NULL.


1m2.8.4.  Widget Instance Deallocation: The deallocate Proce-0m
1mdure0m

The deallocate procedure pointer in the 4mObjectClassExtension0m
record is of type 4mXtDeallocateProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtDeallocateProc)(Widget, XtPointer);
      Widget 4mwidget24m;
      XtPointer 4mmore_bytes24m;


4mwidget24m    Specifies the widget being destroyed.

4mmore_bytes0m
	  Specifies the auxiliary memory received from the
	  corresponding allocator along with the widget, or
	  NULL.
|__

When a widget is destroyed, if an 4mObjectClassExtension0m
record exists in the object class part 4mextension24m field with



			     1m850m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mrecord_type24m 4mNULLQUARK24m and the 4mdeallocate24m field is not NULL,
the 4mXtDeallocateProc24m will be called.  If no ObjectClassPart
extension record is declared with 4mrecord_type24m equal to 4mNUL-0m
4mLQUARK24m, then 4mXtInheritAllocate24m and 4mXtInheritDeallocate24m are
assumed.  The responsibilities of the deallocate procedure
are to deallocate the memory specified by 4mmore_bytes24m if it
is not NULL, to deallocate the constraints record as speci-
fied by the widget's 4mcore.constraints24m field if it is not
NULL, and to deallocate the widget instance itself.

If no 4mXtDeallocateProc24m is found, it is assumed that the
Intrinsics originally allocated the memory and is responsi-
ble for freeing it.


1m2.9.	Exiting from an Application0m

All X Toolkit applications should terminate by calling 4mXtDe-0m
4mstroyApplicationContext24m and then exiting using the standard
method for their operating system (typically, by calling
4mexit24m for POSIX-based systems).  The quickest way to make the
windows disappear while exiting is to call 4mXtUnmapWidget24m on
each top-level shell widget.  The Intrinsics have no
resources beyond those in the program image, and the X
server will free its resources when its connection to the
application is broken.

Depending upon the widget set in use, it may be necessary to
explicitly destroy individual widgets or widget trees with
4mXtDestroyWidget24m before calling 4mXtDestroyApplicationContext0m
in order to ensure that any required widget cleanup is prop-
erly executed.	The application developer must refer to the
widget documentation to learn if a widget needs to perform
cleanup beyond that performed automatically by the operating
system.	 If the client is a session participant (see Section
4.2), then the client may wish to resign from the session
before exiting.	 See Section 4.2.4 for details.

	    1mComposite Widgets and Their Children0m



Composite widgets (widgets whose class is a subclass of 4mcom-0m
4mpositeWidgetClass24m) can have an arbitrary number of children.
Consequently, they are responsible for much more than primi-
tive widgets.  Their responsibilities (either implemented
directly by the widget class or indirectly by Intrinsics
functions) include:

    Overall management of children from creation to
     destruction.

    Destruction of descendants when the composite widget is
     destroyed.

    Physical arrangement (geometry management) of a dis-
     playable subset of children (that is, the managed chil-
     dren).

    Mapping and unmapping of a subset of the managed chil-
     dren.

Overall management is handled by the generic procedures
4mXtCreateWidget24m and 4mXtDestroyWidget24m.  4mXtCreateWidget24m adds
children to their parent by calling the parent's
insert_child procedure.	 4mXtDestroyWidget24m removes children
from their parent by calling the parent's delete_child pro-
cedure and ensures that all children of a destroyed compos-
ite widget also get destroyed.

Only a subset of the total number of children is actually
managed by the geometry manager and hence possibly visible.
For example, a composite editor widget supporting multiple
editing buffers might allocate one child widget for each
file buffer, but it might display only a small number of the
existing buffers.  Widgets that are in this displayable sub-
set are called managed widgets and enter into geometry man-
ager calculations.  The other children are called unmanaged
widgets and, by definition, are not mapped by the Intrin-
sics.

Children are added to and removed from their parent's man-
aged set by using 4mXtManageChild24m, 4mXtManageChildren24m, 4mXtUnman-0m
4mageChild24m, 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m, and 4mXtChangeManagedSet24m, which
notify the parent to recalculate the physical layout of its
children by calling the parent's change_managed procedure.
The 4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m convenience function calls 4mXtCre-0m
4mateWidget24m and 4mXtManageChild24m on the result.



			     1m870m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Most managed children are mapped, but some widgets can be in
a state where they take up physical space but do not show
anything.  Managed widgets are not mapped automatically if
their 4mmap_when_managed24m field is 4mFalse24m.  The default is 4mTrue0m
and is changed by using 4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m.

Each composite widget class declares a geometry manager,
which is responsible for figuring out where the managed
children should appear within the composite widget's window.
Geometry management techniques fall into four classes:

Fixed boxes	Fixed boxes have a fixed number of children
		created by the parent.	All these children
		are managed, and none ever makes geometry
		manager requests.

Homogeneous boxes
		Homogeneous boxes treat all children equally
		and apply the same geometry constraints to
		each child.  Many clients insert and delete
		widgets freely.

Heterogeneous boxes
		Heterogeneous boxes have a specific location
		where each child is placed.  This location
		usually is not specified in pixels, because
		the window may be resized, but is expressed
		rather in terms of the relationship between
		a child and the parent or between the child
		and other specific children.  The class of
		heterogeneous boxes is usually a subclass of
		Constraint.

Shell boxes	Shell boxes typically have only one child,
		and the child's size is usually exactly the
		size of the shell.  The geometry manager
		must communicate with the window manager, if
		it exists, and the box must also accept 4mCon-0m
		4mfigureNotify24m events when the window size is
		changed by the window manager.


1m3.1.	Addition of Children to a Composite Widget: The0m
1minsert_child Procedure0m

To add a child to the parent's list of children, the 4mXtCre-0m
4mateWidget24m function calls the parent's class routine
insert_child.  The insert_child procedure pointer in a com-
posite widget is of type 4mXtWidgetProc24m.

typedef void (*XtWidgetProc)(Widget);
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Passes the newly created child.
|__

Most composite widgets inherit their superclass's operation.
The insert_child routine in 4mCompositeWidgetClass24mcalls and
inserts the child at the specified position in the 4mchildren0m
list, expanding it if necessary.

Some composite widgets define their own insert_child routine
so that they can order their children in some convenient
way, create companion controller widgets for a new widget,
or limit the number or class of their child widgets.  A com-
posite widget class that wishes to allow nonwidget children
(see Chapter 12) must specify a 4mCompositeClassExtension0m
extension record as described in Section 1.4.2.1 and set the
4maccepts_objects24m field in this record to 4mTrue24m.	 If the 4mCom-0m
4mpositeClassExtension24m record is not specified or the
4maccepts_objects24m field is 4mFalse24m, the composite widget can
assume that all its children are of a subclass of Core with-
out an explicit subclass test in the insert_child procedure.

If there is not enough room to insert a new child in the
4mchildren24m array (that is, 4mnum_children24m is equal to
4mnum_slots24m), the insert_child procedure must first reallocate
the array and update 4mnum_slots24m.  The insert_child procedure
then places the child at the appropriate position in the
array and increments the 4mnum_children24m field.


1m3.2.	Insertion Order of Children: The insert_position Pro-0m
1mcedure0m

Instances of composite widgets sometimes need to specify
more about the order in which their children are kept.	For
example, an application may want a set of command buttons in
some logical order grouped by function, and it may want but-
tons that represent file names to be kept in alphabetical
order without constraining the order in which the buttons
are created.

An application controls the presentation order of a set of
children by supplying an XtNinsertPosition resource.  The
insert_position procedure pointer in a composite widget
instance is of type 4mXtOrderProc24m.

typedef Cardinal (*XtOrderProc)(Widget);
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Passes the newly created widget.
|__

Composite widgets that allow clients to order their children
(usually homogeneous boxes) can call their widget instance's
insert_position procedure from the class's insert_child pro-
cedure to determine where a new child should go in its 4mchil-0m
4mdren24m array.  Thus, a client using a composite class can
apply different sorting criteria to widget instances of the
class, passing in a different insert_position procedure
resource when it creates each composite widget instance.

The return value of the insert_position procedure indicates
how many children should go before the widget.	Returning
zero indicates that the widget should go before all other
children, and returning 4mnum_children24m indicates that it
should go after all other children.  The default
insert_position function returns 4mnum_children24m and can be
overridden by a specific composite widget's resource list or
by the argument list provided when the composite widget is
created.


1m3.3.	Deletion of Children: The delete_child Procedure0m


To remove the child from the parent's 4mchildren24m list, the
4mXtDestroyWidget24m function eventually causes a call to the
Composite parent's class delete_child procedure.  The
delete_child procedure pointer is of type 4mXtWidgetProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtWidgetProc)(Widget);
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	  Passes the child being deleted.
|__

Most widgets inherit the delete_child procedure from their
superclass.  Composite widgets that create companion widgets
define their own delete_child procedure to remove these com-
panion widgets.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m3.4.	Adding and Removing Children from the Managed Set0m

The Intrinsics provide a set of generic routines to permit
the addition of widgets to or the removal of widgets from a
composite widget's managed set.	 These generic routines
eventually call the composite widget's change_managed proce-
dure if the procedure pointer is non-NULL.  The change_man-
aged procedure pointer is of type 4mXtWidgetProc24m.  The widget
argument specifies the composite widget whose managed child
set has been modified.


1m3.4.1.  Managing Children0m

To add a list of widgets to the geometry-managed (and hence
displayable) subset of their Composite parent, use 4mXtMan-0m
4mageChildren24m.

__
|
typedef Widget *WidgetList;

void XtManageChildren(4mchildren24m, 4mnum_children24m)
      WidgetList 4mchildren24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_children24m;


4mchildren24m  Specifies a list of child widgets.  Each child
	  must be of class RectObj or any subclass thereof.

4mnum_children0m
	  Specifies the number of children in the list.
|__

The 4mXtManageChildren24m function performs the following:

    Issues an error if the children do not all have the
     same parent or if the parent's class is not a subclass
     of 4mcompositeWidgetClass24m.

    Returns immediately if the common parent is being
     destroyed; otherwise, for each unique child on the
     list, 4mXtManageChildren24m ignores the child if it already
     is managed or is being destroyed, and marks it if not.

    If the parent is realized and after all children have
     been marked, it makes some of the newly managed chil-
     dren viewable:

     -	  Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets'
	  parent.

     -	  Calls 4mXtRealizeWidget24m on each previously unmanaged
	  child that is unrealized.



			     1m910m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     -	  Maps each previously unmanaged child that has
	  4mmap_when_managed24m 4mTrue24m.

Managing children is independent of the ordering of children
and independent of creating and deleting children.  The lay-
out routine of the parent should consider children whose
4mmanaged24m field is 4mTrue24m and should ignore all other children.
Note that some composite widgets, especially fixed boxes,
call 4mXtManageChild24m from their insert_child procedure.

If the parent widget is realized, its change_managed proce-
dure is called to notify it that its set of managed children
has changed.  The parent can reposition and resize any of
its children.  It moves each child as needed by calling
4mXtMoveWidget24m, which first updates the 4mx24m and 4my24m fields and
which then calls 4mXMoveWindow24m.

If the composite widget wishes to change the size or border
width of any of its children, it calls 4mXtResizeWidget24m, which
first updates the 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m fields and
then calls 4mXConfigureWindow24m.  Simultaneous repositioning and
resizing may be done with 4mXtConfigureWidget24m; see Section
6.6.


To add a single child to its parent widget's set of managed
children, use 4mXtManageChild24m.

__
|
void XtManageChild(4mchild24m)
      Widget 4mchild24m;


4mchild24m     Specifies the child.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtManageChild24m function constructs a 4mWidgetList24m of length
1 and calls 4mXtManageChildren24m.


To create and manage a child widget in a single procedure,
use 4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m or 4mXtVaCreateManagedWidget24m.

	  Composite or any subclass thereof.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list to override any other
	  resource specifications.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.

The 4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m function is a convenience routine
that calls 4mXtCreateWidget24m and 4mXtManageChild24m.

      Widget 4mparent24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the resource instance name for the cre-
	  ated widget.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class pointer for the created
	  widget.  Must be 1mrectObjClass 22mor any subclass
	  thereof.

4mparent24m    Specifies the parent widget.  Must be of class
	  Composite or any subclass thereof.

4mXtVaCreateManagedWidget24m is identical in function to 4mXtCre-0m
4mateManagedWidget24m with the 4margs24m and 4mnum_args24m parameters
replaced by a varargs list, as described in Section 2.5.1.


1m3.4.2.  Unmanaging Children0m

To remove a list of children from a parent widget's managed
list, use 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m.

__
|
void XtUnmanageChildren(4mchildren24m, 4mnum_children24m)
      WidgetList 4mchildren24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_children24m;


4mchildren24m  Specifies a list of child widgets.  Each child
	  must be of class RectObj or any subclass thereof.

4mnum_children0m
	  Specifies the number of children.
|__

The 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m function performs the following:

    Returns immediately if the common parent is being
     destroyed.

    Issues an error if the children do not all have the
     same parent or if the parent is not a subclass of 4mcom-0m
     4mpositeWidgetClass24m.



			     1m940m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    For each unique child on the list, 4mXtUnmanageChildren0m
     ignores the child if it is unmanaged; otherwise it per-
     forms the following:

     -	  Marks the child as unmanaged.

     -	  If the child is realized and the 4mmap_when_managed0m
	  field is 4mTrue24m, it is unmapped.

    If the parent is realized and if any children have
     become unmanaged, calls the change_managed routine of
     the widgets' parent.

4mXtUnmanageChildren24m does not destroy the child widgets.
Removing widgets from a parent's managed set is often a tem-
porary banishment, and some time later the client may manage
the children again.  To destroy widgets entirely, 4mXtDestroy-0m
4mWidget24m should be called instead; see Section 2.9.


To remove a single child from its parent widget's managed
set, use 4mXtUnmanageChild24m.

__
|
void XtUnmanageChild(4mchild24m)
      Widget 4mchild24m;


4mchild24m     Specifies the child.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtUnmanageChild24m function constructs a widget list of
length 1 and calls 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m.

These functions are low-level routines that are used by
generic composite widget building routines.  In addition,
composite widgets can provide widget-specific, high-level
convenience procedures.


1m3.4.3.  Bundling Changes to the Managed Set0m

A client may simultaneously unmanage and manage children
with a single call to the Intrinsics.  In this same call the
client may provide a callback procedure that can modify the
geometries of one or more children.  The composite widget
class defines whether this single client call results in
separate invocations of the change_managed method, one to
unmanage and the other to manage, or in just a single invo-
cation.





			     1m950m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To simultaneously remove from and add to the geometry-man-
aged set of children of a composite parent, use 4mXtChangeMan-0m
4magedSet24m.

__

void XtChangeManagedSet(4munmanage_children24m, 4mnum_unmanage_children24m,
					      4mdo_change_proc24m, 4mclient_data24m,

      WidgetList 4mmanage_children24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_manage_children24m;


4munmanage_children24m Specifies the list of widget children to
		  initially remove from the managed set.

4mnum_unmanage_children0m
		  Specifies the number of entries in the
		  4munmanage_children24m list.

4mdo_change_proc24m    Specifies a procedure to invoke between
		  unmanaging and managing the children, or
		  NULL.

4mclient_data24m       Specifies client data to be passed to the
		  do_change_proc.

4mmanage_children24m   Specifies the list of widget children to
		  finally add to the managed set.

4mnum_manage_children0m
		  Specifies the number of entries in the
		  4mmanage_children24m list.
|__

The 4mXtChangeManagedSet24m function performs the following:

    Returns immediately if 4mnum_unmanage_children24m and
     4mnum_manage_children24m are both 0.

    Issues a warning and returns if the widgets specified
     in the 4mmanage_children24m and the 4munmanage_children24m lists
     do not all have the same parent or if that parent is
     not a subclass of 4mcompositeWidgetClass24m.

    Returns immediately if the common parent is being
     destroyed.

    If 4mdo_change_proc24m is not NULL and the parent's 4mCompos-0m
     4miteClassExtension24m 4mallows_change_managed_set24m field is



			     1m960m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     4mFalse24m, then 4mXtChangeManagedSet24m performs the following:

     -	  Calls 4mXtUnmanageChildren24m (4munmanage_children24m,
	  4mnum_unmanage_children24m).

     -	  Calls the 4mdo_change_proc24m.

     -	  Calls 4mXtManageChildren24m (4mmanage_children24m, 4mnum_man-0m
	  4mage_children24m).

    Otherwise, the following is performed:

     -	  For each child on the 4munmanage_children24m list; if
	  the child is already unmanaged it is ignored, oth-
	  erwise it is marked as unmanaged, and if it is
	  realized and its 4mmap_when_managed24m field is 4mTrue24m,
	  it is unmapped.

     -	  If 4mdo_change_proc24m is non-NULL, the procedure is
	  invoked.

     -	  For each child on the 4mmanage_children24m list; if the
	  child is already managed or is being destroyed, it
	  is ignored; otherwise it is marked as managed.

     -	  If the parent is realized and after all children
	  have been marked, the change_managed method of the
	  parent is invoked, and subsequently some of the
	  newly managed children are made viewable by call-
	  ing 4mXtRealizeWidget24m on each previously unmanaged
	  child that is unrealized and mapping each previ-
	  ously unmanaged child that has 4mmap_when_managed0m
	  4mTrue24m.

If no 4mCompositeClassExtension24m record is found in the par-
ent's composite class part 4mextension24m field with record type
4mNULLQUARK24m and version greater than 1, and if 4mXtInher-0m
4mitChangeManaged24m was specified in the parent's class record
during class initialization, the value of the
4mallows_change_managed_set24m field is inherited from the super-
class.	The value inherited from 4mcompositeWidgetClass24m for
the 4mallows_change_managed_set24m field is 4mFalse24m.

It is not an error to include a child in both the 4munman-0m
4mage_children24m and the 4mmanage_children24m lists.  The effect of
such a call is that the child remains managed following the
call, but the 4mdo_change_proc24m is able to affect the child
while it is in an unmanaged state.


The 4mdo_change_proc24m is of type 4mXtDoChangeProc24m.

The 4mdo_change_proc24m procedure is used by the caller of
4mXtChangeManagedSet24m to make changes to one or more children
at the point when the managed set contains the fewest
entries.  These changes may involve geometry requests, and
in this case the caller of 4mXtChangeManagedSet24m may take
advantage of the fact that the Intrinsics internally grant
geometry requests made by unmanaged children without invok-
ing the parent's geometry manager.  To achieve this advan-
tage, if the 4mdo_change_proc24m procedure changes the geometry
of a child or of a descendant of a child, then that child
should be included in the 4munmanage_children24m and 4mmanage_chil-0m
4mdren24m lists.

The 4mXtIsManaged24m function returns 4mTrue24m if the specified wid-
get is of class RectObj or any subclass thereof and is man-
aged, or 4mFalse24m otherwise.


1m3.5.	Controlling When Widgets Get Mapped0m

A widget is normally mapped if it is managed.  However, this
behavior can be overridden by setting the XtNmappedWhenMan-
aged resource for the widget when it is created or by set-
ting the 4mmap_when_managed24m field to 4mFalse24m.


To change the value of a given widget's 4mmap_when_managed0m
field, use 4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m.

4mmap_when_managed0m
	  Specifies a Boolean value that indicates the new
	  value that is stored into the widget's
	  4mmap_when_managed24m field.
|__

If the widget is realized and managed, and if 4mmap_when_man-0m
4maged24m is 4mTrue24m, 4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m maps the window.  If
the widget is realized and managed, and if 4mmap_when_managed0m
is 4mFalse24m, it unmaps the window.  4mXtSetMappedWhenManaged24m is a
convenience function that is equivalent to (but slightly
faster than) calling 4mXtSetValues24m and setting the new value
for the XtNmappedWhenManaged resource then mapping the wid-
get as appropriate.  As an alternative to using 4mXtSetMapped-0m
4mWhenManaged24m to control mapping, a client may set
4mmapped_when_managed24m to 4mFalse24m and use 4mXtMapWidget24m and 4mXtUn-0m

1m3.6.	Constrained Composite Widgets0m

The Constraint widget class is a subclass of 4mcompositeWid-0m
4mgetClass24m.	The name is derived from the fact that constraint
widgets may manage the geometry of their children based on
constraints associated with each child.	 These constraints
can be as simple as the maximum width and height the parent
will allow the child to occupy or can be as complicated as
how other children should change if this child is moved or
resized.  Constraint widgets let a parent define constraints
as resources that are supplied for their children.  For
example, if the Constraint parent defines the maximum sizes
for its children, these new size resources are retrieved for
each child as if they were resources that were defined by
the child widget's class.  Accordingly, constraint resources
may be included in the argument list or resource file just
like any other resource for the child.

Constraint widgets have all the responsibilities of normal
composite widgets and, in addition, must process and act
upon the constraint information associated with each of
their children.

To make it easy for widgets and the Intrinsics to keep track
of the constraints associated with a child, every widget has
a 4mconstraints24m field, which is the address of a parent-spe-
cific structure that contains constraint information about
the child.  If a child's parent does not belong to a



			     1m1000m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


subclass of 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m, then the child's 4mcon-0m
4mstraints24m field is NULL.

Subclasses of Constraint can add constraint data to the con-
straint record defined by their superclass.  To allow this,
widget writers should define the constraint records in their
private .h file by using the same conventions as used for
widget records.	 For example, a widget class that needs to
maintain a maximum width and height for each child might
define its constraint record as follows:


     typedef struct {
	  Dimension max_width, max_height;
     } MaxConstraintPart;

     typedef struct {
	  MaxConstraintPart max;
     } MaxConstraintRecord, *MaxConstraint;


A subclass of this widget class that also needs to maintain
a minimum size would define its constraint record as fol-
lows:


     typedef struct {
	  Dimension min_width, min_height;
     } MinConstraintPart;

     typedef struct {
	  MaxConstraintPart max;
	  MinConstraintPart min;
     } MaxMinConstraintRecord, *MaxMinConstraint;


Constraints are allocated, initialized, deallocated, and
otherwise maintained insofar as possible by the Intrinsics.
The Constraint class record part has several entries that
facilitate this.  All entries in 4mConstraintClassPart24m are
fields and procedures that are defined and implemented by
the parent, but they are called whenever actions are per-
formed on the parent's children.

The 4mXtCreateWidget24m function uses the 4mconstraint_size24m field
in the parent's class record to allocate a constraint record
when a child is created.  4mXtCreateWidget24m also uses the con-
straint resources to fill in resource fields in the con-
straint record associated with a child.	 It then calls the
constraint initialize procedure so that the parent can com-
pute constraint fields that are derived from constraint
resources and can possibly move or resize the child to con-
form to the given constraints.

When the 4mXtGetValues24m and 4mXtSetValues24m functions are executed
on a child, they use the constraint resources to get the
values or set the values of constraints associated with that
child.	4mXtSetValues24m then calls the constraint set_values
procedures so that the parent can recompute derived con-
straint fields and move or resize the child as appropriate.
If a Constraint widget class or any of its superclasses have
declared a 4mConstraintClassExtension24m record in the 4mCon-0m
4mstraintClassPart24m 4mextension24m fields with a record type of 4mNUL-0m
4mLQUARK24m and the 4mget_values_hook24m field in the extension record
is non-NULL, 4mXtGetValues24m calls the get_values_hook proce-
dure(s) to allow the parent to return derived constraint
fields.

The 4mXtDestroyWidget24m function calls the constraint destroy
procedure to deallocate any dynamic storage associated with
a constraint record.  The constraint record itself must not
be deallocated by the constraint destroy procedure; 4mXtDe-0m
4mstroyWidget24m does this automatically.

		       1mShell Widgets0m




Shell widgets hold an application's top-level widgets to
allow them to communicate with the window manager and ses-
sion manager.  Shells have been designed to be as nearly
invisible as possible.	Clients have to create them, but
they should never have to worry about their sizes.

If a shell widget is resized from the outside (typically by
a window manager), the shell widget also resizes its managed
child widget automatically.  Similarly, if the shell's child
widget needs to change size, it can make a geometry request
to the shell, and the shell negotiates the size change with
the outer environment.	Clients should never attempt to
change the size of their shells directly.

The five types of public shells are:

4mOverrideShell24m     Used for shell windows that completely
		  bypass the window manager (for example,
		  pop-up menu shells).

4mTransientShell24m    Used for shell windows that have the
		  4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR24m property set. The effect
		  of this property is dependent upon the
		  window manager being used.

4mTopLevelShell24m     Used for normal top-level windows (for
		  example, any additional top-level widgets
		  an application needs).

4mApplication-24m      Formerly used for the single main top-
4mShell24m	       level window that the window manager iden-
		  tifies as an application instance and made
		  obsolete by SessionShell.

4mSessionShell24m      Used for the single main top-level window
		  that the window manager identifies as an
		  application instance and that interacts
		  with the session manager.



1m4.1.	Shell Widget Definitions0m

Widgets negotiate their size and position with their parent
widget, that is, the widget that directly contains them.



			     1m1030m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Widgets at the top of the hierarchy do not have parent wid-
gets.  Instead, they must deal with the outside world.	To
provide for this, each top-level widget is encapsulated in a
special widget, called a shell widget.

Shell widgets, whose class is a subclass of the Composite
class, encapsulate other widgets and can allow a widget to
avoid the geometry clipping imposed by the parent-child win-
dow relationship.  They also can provide a layer of communi-
cation with the window manager.

The eight different types of shells are:

4mShell24m	       The base class for shell widgets; provides
		  the fields needed for all types of shells.
		  Shell is a direct subclass of 4mcompositeWid-0m
		  4mgetClass24m.
4mOverrideShell24m     A subclass of Shell; used for shell windows
		  that completely bypass the window manager.
4mWMShell24m	       A subclass of Shell; contains fields needed
		  by the common window manager protocol.
4mVendorShell24m       A subclass of WMShell; contains fields used
		  by vendor-specific window managers.
4mTransientShell24m    A subclass of VendorShell; used for shell
		  windows that desire the 4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR0m
		  property.
4mTopLevelShell24m     A subclass of VendorShell; used for normal
		  top-level windows.
4mApplication-24m      A subclass of TopLevelShell; may be used for
4mShell24m	       an application's additional root windows.
4mSessionShell24m      A subclass of ApplicationShell; used for an
		  application's main root window.


Note that the classes Shell, WMShell, and VendorShell are
internal and should not be instantiated or subclassed.	Only
OverrrideShell, TransientShell, TopLevelShell, Application-
Shell, and SessionShell are intended for public use.


1m4.1.1.  ShellClassPart Definitions0m

Only the Shell class has additional class fields, which are
all contained in the 4mShellClassExtensionRec24m.  None of the
other Shell classes have any additional class fields:

The declarations for all Intrinsics-defined shells except
VendorShell appear in 4mShell.h24m and 4mShellP.h24m.  VendorShell has
separate public and private .h files which are included by



			     1m1080m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mShell.h24m and 4mShellP.h24m.

4mShell.h24m uses incomplete structure definitions to ensure that
the compiler catches attempts to access private data in any
of the Shell instance or class data structures.

The symbolic constant for the 4mShellClassExtension24m version
identifier is 4mXtShellExtensionVersion24m (see Section 1.6.12).

The root_geometry_manager procedure acts as the parent geom-
etry manager for geometry requests made by shell widgets.
When a shell widget calls either 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m or
4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m, the root_geometry_manager procedure is
invoked to negotiate the new geometry with the window man-
ager.  If the window manager permits the new geometry, the
root_geometry_manager procedure should return 4mXtGeometryYes24m;
if the window manager denies the geometry request or does
not change the window geometry within some timeout interval
(equal to 4mwm_timeout24m in the case of WMShells), the
root_geometry_manager procedure should return 4mXtGeometryNo24m.
If the window manager makes some alternative geometry
change, the root_geometry_manager procedure may return
either 4mXtGeometryNo24m and handle the new geometry as a resize
or 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m in anticipation that the shell will
accept the compromise.	If the compromise is not accepted,
the new size must then be handled as a resize.	Subclasses
of Shell that wish to provide their own root_geometry_man-
ager procedures are strongly encouraged to use enveloping to
invoke their superclass's root_geometry_manager procedure
under most situations, as the window manager interaction may
be very complex.

If no 4mShellClassPart24m extension record is declared with
4mrecord_type24m equal to 4mNULLQUARK24m, then 4mXtInheritRootGeometry-0m
4mManager24m is assumed.

usually given only on a command line or in a defaults file.
If the 4mgeometry24m field is non-NULL when a widget of class
WMShell is realized, the geometry specification is parsed
using 4mXWMGeometry24m with a default geometry string constructed
from the values of 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, 4mwidth_inc24m, and
4mheight_inc24m and the size and position flags in the window
manager size hints are set.  If the geometry specifies an x
or y position, then 4mUSPosition24m is set.  If the geometry
specifies a width or height, then 4mUSSize24m is set.  Any fields
in the geometry specification override the corresponding
values in the Core 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, and 4mheight24m fields.	If 4mgeom-0m
4metry24m is NULL or contains only a partial specification, then
the Core 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, and 4mheight24m fields are used and 4mPPosi-0m
4mtion24m and 4mPSize24m are set as appropriate.  The geometry string
is not copied by any of the Intrinsics Shell classes; a
client specifying the string in an arglist or varargs list
must ensure that the value remains valid until the shell
widget is realized.  For further information on the geometry
string, see Section 16.4 in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.

The 4mcreate_popup_child_proc24m procedure is called by the
4mXtPopup24m procedure and may remain NULL.  The 4mgrab_kind24m,
4mspring_loaded24m, and 4mpopped_up24m fields maintain widget state
information as described under 4mXtPopup24m, 4mXtMenuPopup24m, 4mXtPop-0m
4mdown24m, and 4mXtMenuPopdown24m.  The 4mallow_shell_resize24m field con-
trols whether the widget contained by the shell is allowed
to try to resize itself.  If allow_shell_resize is 4mFalse24m,
any geometry requests made by the child will always return
4mXtGeometryNo24m without interacting with the window manager.
Setting 4msave_under24m 4mTrue24m instructs the server to attempt to
save the contents of windows obscured by the shell when it
is mapped and to restore those contents automatically when
the shell is unmapped.	It is useful for pop-up menus.	Set-
ting 4moverride_redirect24m 4mTrue24m determines whether the window
manager can intercede when the shell window is mapped.	For
further information on override_redirect, see Section 3.2 in
4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m and Sections 4.1.10 and 4.2.2
in the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m.  The
pop-up and pop-down callbacks are called during 4mXtPopup24m and
4mXtPopdown24m.	 The default value of the 4mvisual24m resource is the
symbolic value 4mCopyFromParent24m.  The Intrinsics do not need
to query the parent's visual type when the default value is
used; if a client using 4mXtGetValues24m to examine the visual
type receives the value 4mCopyFromParent24m, it must then use
4mXGetWindowAttributes24m if it needs the actual visual type.


The default values for Shell fields in WMShell and its sub-
classes are:

----------------------------------------------------------


The 4mtitle24m and 4mtitle_encoding24m fields are stored in the
4mWM_NAME24m property on the shell's window by the WMShell real-
ize procedure.	If the 4mtitle_encoding24m field is 4mNone24m, the
4mtitle24m string is assumed to be in the encoding of the current
locale and the encoding of the 4mWM_NAME24m property is set to
4mXStdICCTextStyle24m.	If a language procedure has not been set
the default value of 4mtitle_encoding24m is 1mXA_STRING22m, otherwise
the default value is 4mNone24m.	 The 4mwm_timeout24m field specifies,
in milliseconds, the amount of time a shell is to wait for
confirmation of a geometry request to the window manager.
If none comes back within that time, the shell assumes the
window manager is not functioning properly and sets
4mwait_for_wm24m to 4mFalse24m (later events may reset this value).
When 4mwait_for_wm24m is 4mFalse24m, the shell does not wait for a
response, but relies on asynchronous notification.  If 4mtran-0m
4msient24m is 4mTrue24m, the 4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR24m property will be stored
on the shell window with a value as specified below.  The
interpretation of this property is specific to the window



			     1m1180m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


manager under which the application is run; see the 4mInter-0m
4mClient24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m for more details.

The realize and set_values procedures of WMShell store the
4mWM_CLIENT_LEADER24m property on the shell window.  When
4mclient_leader24m is not NULL and the client leader widget is
realized, the property will be created with the value of the
window of the client leader widget.  When 4mclient_leader24m is
NULL and the shell widget has a NULL parent, the widget's
window is used as the value of the property.  When
4mclient_leader24m is NULL and the shell widget has a non-NULL
parent, a search is made for the closest shell ancestor with
a non-NULL 4mclient_leader24m, and if none is found the shell
ancestor with a NULL parent is the result.  If the resulting
widget is realized, the property is created with the value
of the widget's window.

When the value of 4mwindow_role24m is not NULL, the realize and
set_values procedures store the 4mWM_WINDOW_ROLE24m property on
the shell's window with the value of the resource.

All other resources specify fields in the window manager
hints and the window manager size hints.  The realize and
set_values procedures of WMShell set the corresponding flag
bits in the hints if any of the fields contain nondefault
values.	 In addition, if a flag bit is set that refers to a
field with the value 4mXtUnspecifiedShellInt24m, the value of the
field is modified as follows:


------------------------------------------------------------
Field			     Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------
base_width, base_height	     0
width_inc, height_inc	     1
max_width, max_height	     32767
min_width, min_height	     1
min_aspect_x, min_aspect_y   -1
max_aspect_x, max_aspect_y   -1
icon_x, icon_y		     -1
win_gravity		     Value returned by 4mXWMGeometry0m
			     if called, else 1mNorthWestGrav-0m
			     1mity0m
------------------------------------------------------------



If the shell widget has a non-NULL parent, then the realize
and set_values procedures replace the value 4mXtUnspecified-0m
4mWindow24m in the 4mwindow_group24m field with the window id of the
root widget of the widget tree if the root widget is real-
ized. The symbolic constant 4mXtUnspecifiedWindowGroup24m may be
used to indicate that the 4mwindow_group24m hint flag bit is not
to be set.  If 4mtransient24m is 4mTrue24m, the shell's class is not a



			     1m1190m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


subclass of TransientShell, and 4mwindow_group24m is not 4mXtUn-0m
4mspecifiedWindowGroup24m, the WMShell realize and set_values
procedures then store the 4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR24m property with the
value of 4mwindow_group24m.

Transient shells have the following additional resource:

------------------------------
Field		Default Value
------------------------------
transient_for	NULL
------------------------------


The realize and set_values procedures of TransientShell
store the 4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR24m property on the shell window if
4mtransient24m is 4mTrue24m.  If 4mtransient_for24m is non-NULL and the
widget specified by 4mtransient_for24m is realized, then its win-
dow is used as the value of the 4mWM_TRANSIENT_FOR24m property;
otherwise, the value of 4mwindow_group24m is used.

4mTopLevel24m shells have the the following additional resources:

-----------------------------------------
Field		     Default Value
-----------------------------------------
icon_name	     Shell widget's name
iconic		     4mFalse0m
icon_name_encoding   See text
-----------------------------------------


The 4micon_name24m and 4micon_name_encoding24m fields are stored in
the 4mWM_ICON_NAME24m property on the shell's window by the
TopLevelShell realize procedure.  If the 4micon_name_encoding0m
field is 4mNone24m, the 4micon_name24m string is assumed to be in the
encoding of the current locale and the encoding of the
4mWM_ICON_NAME24m property is set to 4mXStdICCTextStyle24m.  If a lan-
guage procedure has not been set, the default value of
4micon_name_encoding24m is 1mXA_STRING22m, otherwise the default value
is 4mNone24m.  The 4miconic24m field may be used by a client to
request that the window manager iconify or deiconify the
shell; the TopLevelShell set_values procedure will send the
appropriate 4mWM_CHANGE_STATE24m message (as specified by the
4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m) if this
resource is changed from 4mFalse24m to 4mTrue24m and will call 4mXtPopup0m
specifying 4mgrab_kind24m as 4mXtGrabNone24m if 4miconic24m is changed from
4mTrue24m to 4mFalse24m.  The XtNiconic resource is also an alterna-
tive way to set the XtNinitialState resource to indicate
that a shell should be initially displayed as an icon; the
TopLevelShell initialize procedure will set 4minitial_state24m to
4mIconicState24m if 4miconic24m is 4mTrue24m.

The 4margc24m and 4margv24m fields are used to initialize the standard
property 4mWM_COMMAND24m.  See the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication0m
4mConventions24m 4mManual24m for more information.

The default values for the SessionShell instance fields,
which are filled in from the resource lists and by the ini-
tialize procedure, are

---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------


The 4mconnection24m field contains the session connection object
or NULL if a session connection is not being managed by this
widget.

The 4msession_id24m is an identification assigned to the session
participant by the session manager.  The 4msession_id24m will be
passed to the session manager as the client identifier of
the previous session.  When a connection is established with
the session manager, the client id assigned by the session
manager is stored in the 4msession_id24m field.	 When not NULL,
the 4msession_id24m of the Session shell widget that is at the
root of the widget tree of the client leader widget will be



			     1m1210m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


used to create the 4mSM_CLIENT_ID24m property on the client
leader's window.

If 4mjoin_session24m is 4mFalse24m, the widget will not attempt to
establish a connection to the session manager at shell cre-
ation time.  See Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.4 for more informa-
tion on the functionality of this resource.

The 4mrestart_command24m, 4mclone_command24m, 4mdiscard_command24m,
4mresign_command24m, 4mshutdown_command24m, 4menvironment24m, 4mcurrent_dir24m,
4mprogram_path24m, and 4mrestart_style24m fields contain standard ses-
sion properties.

When a session connection is established or newly managed by
the shell, the shell initialize and set_values methods check
the values of the 4mrestart_command24m, 4mclone_command24m, and 4mpro-0m
4mgram_path24m resources.  At that time, if 4mrestart_command24m is
NULL, the value of the 4margv24m resource will be copied to
4mrestart_command24m.  Whether or not 4mrestart_command24m was NULL,
if "-xtsessionID" "<session id>" does not already appear in
the 4mrestart_command24m, it will be added by the initialize and
set_values methods at the beginning of the command argu-
ments; if the "-xtsessionID" argument already appears with
an incorrect session id in the following argument, that
argument will be replaced with the current session id.

After this, the shell initialize and set_values procedures
check the 4mclone_command24m.  If 4mclone_command24m is NULL,
4mrestart_command24m will be copied to 4mclone_command24m, except the
"-xtsessionID" and following argument will not be copied.

Finally, the shell initialize and set_values procedures
check the 4mprogram_path24m.  If 4mprogram_path24m is NULL, the first
element of 4mrestart_command24m is copied to 4mprogram_path24m.

The possible values of 4mrestart_style24m are 4mSmRestartIfRunning24m,
4mSmRestartAnyway24m, 4mSmRestartImmediately24m, and 4mSmRestartNever24m.
A resource converter is registered for this resource; for
the strings that it recognizes, see Section 9.6.1.

The resource type EnvironmentArray is a NULL-terminated
array of pointers to strings; each string has the format
"name=value".  The `=' character may not appear in the name,
and the string is terminated by a null character.


1m4.2.	Session Participation0m

Applications can participate in a user's session, exchanging
messages with the session manager as described in the 4mX24m 4mSes-0m
4msion24m 4mManagement24m 4mProtocol24m and the 4mX24m 4mSession24m 4mManagement0m
4mLibrary24m.





			     1m1220m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


When a widget of 4msessionShellWidgetClass24m or a subclass is
created, the widget provides support for the application as
a session participant and continues to provide support until
the widget is destroyed.


1m4.2.1.  Joining a Session0m

When a Session shell is created, if 4mconnection24m is NULL, and
if 4mjoin_session24m is 4mTrue24m, and if 4margv24m or 4mrestart_command24m is
not NULL, and if in POSIX environments the 4mSESSION_MANAGER0m
environment variable is defined, the shell will attempt to
establish a new connection with the session manager.

To transfer management of an existing session connection
from an application to the shell at widget creation time,
pass the existing session connection ID as the 4mconnection0m
resource value when creating the Session shell, and if the
other creation-time conditions on session participation are
met, the widget will maintain the connection with the ses-
sion manager.  The application must ensure that only one
Session shell manages the connection.

In the Session shell set_values procedure, if 4mjoin_session0m
changes from 4mFalse24m to 4mTrue24m and 4mconnection24m is NULL and when
in POSIX environments the 4mSESSION_MANAGER24m environment vari-
able is defined, the shell will attempt to open a connection
to the session manager.	 If 4mconnection24m changes from NULL to
non-NULL, the Session shell will take over management of
that session connection and will set 4mjoin_session24m to 4mTrue24m.
If 4mjoin_session24m changes from 4mFalse24m to 4mTrue24m and 4mconnection24m is
not NULL, the Session shell will take over management of the
session connection.

When a successful connection has been established, 4mconnec-0m
4mtion24m contains the session connection ID for the session par-
ticipant.  When the shell begins to manage the connection,
it will call 4mXtAppAddInput24m to register the handler which
watches for protocol messages from the session manager.
When the attempt to connect fails, a warning message is
issued and 4mconnection24m is set to NULL.

While the connection is being managed, if a 4mSaveYourself24m,
4mSaveYourselfPhase224m, 4mInteract24m, 4mShutdownCancelled24m, 4mSaveCom-0m
4mplete24m, or 4mDie24m message is received from the session manager,
the Session shell will call out to application callback pro-
cedures registered on the respective callback list of the
Session shell and will send 4mSaveYourselfPhase2Request24m,
4mInteractRequest24m, 4mInteractDone24m, 4mSaveYourselfDone24m, and 4mConnec-0m
4mtionClosed24m messages as appropriate.  Initially, all of the
client's session properties are undefined.  When any of the
session property resource values are defined or change, the
Session shell initialize and set_values procedures will
update the client's session property value by a



			     1m1230m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mSetProperties24m or a 4mDeleteProperties24m message, as appropriate.
The session ProcessID and UserID properties are always set
by the shell when it is possible to determine the value of
these properties.


1m4.2.2.  Saving Application State0m

The session manager instigates an application checkpoint by
sending a 4mSaveYourself24m request.  Applications are responsi-
ble for saving their state in response to the request.

When the 4mSaveYourself24m request arrives, the procedures regis-
tered on the Session shell's save callback list are called.
If the application does not register any save callback pro-
cedures on the save callback list, the shell will report to
the session manager that the application failed to save its
state.	Each procedure on the save callback list receives a
token in the 4mcall_data24m parameter.


The checkpoint token in the 4mcall_data24m parameter is of type
4mXtCheckpointToken24m.

__
|
typedef struct {
     int	    save_type;
     int	    interact_style;
     Boolean	    shutdown;
     Boolean	    fast;
     Boolean	    cancel_shutdown
     int	    phase;
     int	    interact_dialog_type;/* return */
     Boolean	    request_cancel;	/* return */
     Boolean	    request_next_phase; /* return */
     Boolean	    save_success;	/* return */
} XtCheckpointTokenRec, *XtCheckpointToken;

|__

The 4msave_type24m, 4minteract_style24m, 4mshutdown24m, and 4mfast24m fields of
the token contain the parameters of the 4mSaveYourself24m mes-
sage.  The possible values of 4msave_type24m are 4mSmSaveLocal24m,
4mSmSaveGlobal24m, and 4mSmSaveBoth24m; these indicate the type of
information to be saved.  The possible values of 4minter-0m
4mact_style24m are 4mSmInteractStyleNone24m, 4mSmInteractStyleErrors24m,
and 4mSmInteractStyleAny24m; these indicate whether user interac-
tion would be permitted and, if so, what kind of interac-
tion.  If 4mshutdown24m is 4mTrue24m, the checkpoint is being per-
formed in preparation for the end of the session.  If 4mfast0m
is 4mTrue24m, the client should perform the checkpoint as quickly
as possible.  If 4mcancel_shutdown24m is 4mTrue24m, a 4mShutdownCan-0m
4mcelled24m message has been received for the current save



			     1m1240m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


operation.  (See Section 4.4.4.)  The 4mphase24m is used by man-
ager clients, such as a window manager, to distinguish
between the first and second phase of a save operation.	 The
4mphase24m will be either 1 or 2.  The remaining fields in the
checkpoint token structure are provided for the application
to communicate with the shell.

Upon entry to the first application save callback procedure,
the return fields in the token have the following initial
values: 4minteract_dialog_type24m is 4mSmDialogNormal24m; 4mrequest_can-0m
4mcel24m is 4mFalse24m; 4mrequest_next_phase24m is 4mFalse24m; and 4msave_success0m
is 4mTrue24m.  When a token is returned with any of the four
return fields containing a noninitial value, and when the
field is applicable, subsequent tokens passed to the appli-
cation during the current save operation will always contain
the noninitial value.

The purpose of the token's 4msave_success24m field is to indicate
the outcome of the entire operation to the session manager
and ultimately, to the user.  Returning 4mFalse24m indicates some
portion of the application state could not be successfully
saved.	If any token is returned to the shell with 4msave_suc-0m
4mcess24m 4mFalse24m, tokens subsequently received by the application
for the current save operation will show 4msave_success24m as
4mFalse24m.  When the shell sends the final status of the check-
point to the session manager, it will indicate failure to
save application state if any token was returned with
4msave_success24m 4mFalse24m.

Session participants that manage and save the state of other
clients should structure their save or interact callbacks to
set 4mrequest_next_phase24m to 4mTrue24m when phase is 1, which will
cause the shell to send the 4mSaveYourselfPhase2Request24m when
the first phase is complete.  When the 4mSaveYourselfPhase20m
message is received, the shell will invoke the save call-
backs a second time with 4mphase24m equal to 2.	 Manager clients
should save the state of other clients when the callbacks
are invoked the second time and 4mphase24m equal to 2.

The application may request additional tokens while a check-
point is under way, and these additional tokens must be
returned by an explicit call.















			     1m1250m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To request an additional token for a save callback response
that has a deferred outcome, use 4mXtSessionGetToken24m.

__
|
XtCheckpointToken XtSessionGetToken(4mwidget24m)
      Widget 4mwidget24m;


4mwidget24m    Specifies the Session shell widget which manages
	  session participation.
|__

The 4mXtSessionGetToken24m function will return NULL if no check-
point operation is currently under way.


To indicate the completion of checkpoint processing includ-
ing user interaction, the application must signal the Ses-
sion shell by returning all tokens.  (See Sections 4.2.2.2
and 4.2.2.4).  To return a token, use 4mXtSessionReturnToken24m.

__
|
void XtSessionReturnToken(4mtoken24m)
      XtCheckpointToken 4mtoken24m;


4mtoken24m     Specifies a token that was received as the
	  4mcall_data24m by a procedure on the interact callback
	  list or a token that was received by a call to
	  4mXtSessionGetToken24m.
|__


Tokens passed as 4mcall_data24m to save callbacks are implicitly
returned when the save callback procedure returns.  A save
callback procedure should not call 4mXtSessionReturnToken24m on
the token passed in its 4mcall_data24m.


1m4.2.2.1.  Requesting Interaction0m

When the token 4minteract_style24m allows user interaction, the
application may interact with the user during the check-
point, but must wait for permission to interact.  Applica-
tions request permission to interact with the user during
the checkpointing operation by registering a procedure on
the Session shell's interact callback list.  When all save
callback procedures have returned, and each time a token
that was granted by a call to 4mXtSessionGetToken24m is returned,
the Session shell examines the interact callback list.	If
interaction is permitted and the interact callback list is
not empty, the shell will send an 4mInteractRequest24m to the



			     1m1260m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


session manager when an interact request is not already out-
standing for the application.

The type of interaction dialog that will be requested is
specified by the 4minteract_dialog_type24m field in the check-
point token.  The possible values for 4minteract_dialog_type0m
are 4mSmDialogError24m and 4mSmDialogNormal24m.	 If a token is
returned with 4minteract_dialog_type24m containing 4mSmDialogError24m,
the interact request and any subsequent interact requests
will be for an error dialog; otherwise, the request will be
for a normal dialog with the user.

When a token is returned with 4msave_success24m 4mFalse24m or 4minter-0m
4mact_dialog_type24m 4mSmDialogError24m, tokens subsequently passed to
callbacks during the same active 4mSaveYourself24m response will
reflect these changed values, indicating that an error con-
dition has occurred during the checkpoint.

The 4mrequest_cancel24m field is a return value for interact
callbacks only.	 Upon return from a procedure on the save
callback list, the value of the token's 4mrequest_cancel24m field
is not examined by the shell.  This is also true of tokens
received through a call to 4mXtSessionGetToken24m.


1m4.2.2.2.  Interacting with the User during a Checkpoint0m

When the session manager grants the application's request
for user interaction, the Session shell receives an 4mInteract0m
message.  The procedures registered on the interact callback
list are executed, but not as if executing a typical call-
back list.  These procedures are individually executed in
sequence, with a checkpoint token functioning as the
sequencing mechanism.  Each step in the sequence begins by
removing a procedure from the interact callback list and
executing it with a token passed in the 4mcall_data24m.	 The
interact callback will typically pop up a dialog box and
return.	 When the user interaction and associated applica-
tion checkpointing has completed, the application must
return the token by calling 4mXtSessionReturnToken24m.	Returning
the token completes the current step and triggers the next
step in the sequence.

During interaction the client may request cancellation of a
shutdown.  When a token passed as 4mcall_data24m to an interact
procedure is returned, if 4mshutdown24m is 4mTrue24m and 4mcancel_shut-0m
4mdown24m is 4mFalse24m, 4mrequest_cancel24m indicates whether the applica-
tion requests that the pending shutdown be cancelled.  If
4mrequest_cancel24m is 4mTrue24m, the field will also be 4mTrue24m in any
tokens subsequently granted during the checkpoint operation.
When a token is returned requesting cancellation of the ses-
sion shutdown, pending interact procedures will still be
called by the Session shell.  When all interact procedures
have been removed from the interact callback list, executed,



			     1m1270m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


and the final interact token returned to the shell, an
4mInteractDone24m message is sent to the session manager, indi-
cating whether a pending session shutdown is requested to be
cancelled.


1m4.2.2.3.  Responding to a Shutdown Cancellation0m

Callbacks registered on the cancel callback list are invoked
when the Session shell processes a 4mShutdownCancelled24m message
from the session manager.  This may occur during the pro-
cessing of save callbacks, while waiting for interact per-
mission, during user interaction, or after the save opera-
tion is complete and the application is expecting a 4mSaveCom-0m
4mplete24m or a 4mDie24m message.  The 4mcall_data24m for these callbacks
is NULL.

When the shell notices that a pending shutdown has been can-
celled, the token 4mcancel_shutdown24m field will be 4mTrue24m in
tokens subsequently given to the application.

Receiving notice of a shutdown cancellation does not cancel
the pending execution of save callbacks or interact call-
backs.	After the cancel callbacks execute, if 4minter-0m
4mact_style24m is not 4mSmInteractStyleNone24m and the interact list
is not empty, the procedures on the interact callback list
will be executed and passed a token with 4minteract_style0m
4mSmInteractStyleNone24m.  The application should not interact
with the user, and the Session shell will not send an 4mInter-0m
4mactDone24m message.


1m4.2.2.4.  Completing a Save0m

When there is no user interaction, the shell regards the
application as having finished saving state when all call-
back procedures on the save callback list have returned, and
any additional tokens passed out by 4mXtSessionGetToken24m have
been returned by corresponding calls to 4mXtSessionReturnTo-0m
4mken24m.  If the save operation involved user interaction, the
above completion conditions apply, and in addition, all
requests for interaction have been granted or cancelled, and
all tokens passed to interact callbacks have been returned
through calls to 4mXtSessionReturnToken24m.  If the save opera-
tion involved a manager client that requested the second
phase, the above conditions apply to both the first and sec-
ond phase of the save operation.

When the application has finished saving state, the Session
shell will report the result to the session manager by send-
ing the 4mSaveYourselfDone24m message.	If the session is contin-
uing, the shell will receive the 4mSaveComplete24m message when
all applications have completed saving state.  This message
indicates that applications may again allow changes to their



			     1m1280m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


state.	The shell will execute the save_complete callbacks.
The 4mcall_data24m for these callbacks is NULL.


1m4.2.3.  Responding to a Shutdown0m

Callbacks registered on the die callback list are invoked
when the session manager sends a 4mDie24m message.  The callbacks
on this list should do whatever is appropriate to quit the
application.  Before executing procedures on the die call-
back list, the Session shell will close the connection to
the session manager and will remove the handler that watches
for protocol messages.	The 4mcall_data24m for these callbacks is
NULL.


1m4.2.4.  Resigning from a Session0m

When the Session shell widget is destroyed, the destroy
method will close the connection to the session manager by
sending a 4mConnectionClosed24m protocol message and will remove
the input callback that was watching for session protocol
messages.

When 4mXtSetValues24m is used to set 4mjoin_session24m to 4mFalse24m, the
set_values method of the Session shell will close the con-
nection to the session manager if one exists by sending a
4mConnectionClosed24m message, and 4mconnection24m will be set to
NULL.

Applications that exit in response to user actions and that
do not wait for phase 2 destroy to complete on the Session
shell should set 4mjoin_session24m to 4mFalse24m before exiting.

When 4mXtSetValues24m is used to set 4mconnection24m to NULL, the Ses-
sion shell will stop managing the connection, if one exists.
However, that session connection will not be closed.

Applications that wish to ensure continuation of a session
connection beyond the destruction of the shell should first
retrieve the 4mconnection24m resource value, then set the 4mconnec-0m
4mtion24m resource to NULL, and then they may safely destroy the
widget without losing control of the session connection.

The error callback list will be called if an unrecoverable
communications error occurs while the shell is managing the
connection.  The shell will close the connection, set 4mcon-0m
4mnection24m to NULL, remove the input callback, and call the
procedures registered on the error callback list.  The
4mcall_data24m for these callbacks is NULL.

		       1mPop-Up Widgets0m



Pop-up widgets are used to create windows outside of the
window hierarchy defined by the widget tree.  Each pop-up
child has a window that is a descendant of the root window,
so that the pop-up window is not clipped by the pop-up wid-
get's parent window.  Therefore, pop-ups are created and
attached differently to their widget parent than normal wid-
get children.

A parent of a pop-up widget does not actively manage its
pop-up children; in fact, it usually does not operate upon
them in any way.  The 4mpopup_list24m field in the 4mCorePart0m
structure contains the list of its pop-up children.  This
pop-up list exists mainly to provide the proper place in the
widget hierarchy for the pop-up to get resources and to pro-
vide a place for 4mXtDestroyWidget24m to look for all extant
children.

A composite widget can have both normal and pop-up children.
A pop-up can be popped up from almost anywhere, not just by
its parent.  The term 4mchild24m always refers to a normal, geom-
etry-managed widget on the composite widget's list of chil-
dren, and the term 4mpop-up24m 4mchild24m always refers to a widget on
the pop-up list.


1m5.1.	Pop-Up Widget Types0m

There are three kinds of pop-up widgets:

    Modeless pop-ups

     A modeless pop-up (for example, a dialog box that does
     not prevent continued interaction with the rest of the
     application) can usually be manipulated by the window
     manager and looks like any other application window
     from the user's point of view.  The application main
     window itself is a special case of a modeless pop-up.

    Modal pop-ups

     A modal pop-up (for example, a dialog box that requires
     user input to continue) can sometimes be manipulated by
     the window manager, and except for events that occur in
     the dialog box, it disables user-event distribution to
     the rest of the application.




			     1m1300m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Spring-loaded pop-ups

     A spring-loaded pop-up (for example, a menu) can seldom
     be manipulated by the window manager, and except for
     events that occur in the pop-up or its descendants, it
     disables user-event distribution to all other applica-
     tions.

Modal pop-ups and spring-loaded pop-ups are very similar and
should be coded as if they were the same.  In fact, the same
widget (for example, a ButtonBox or Menu widget) can be used
both as a modal pop-up and as a spring-loaded pop-up within
the same application.  The main difference is that spring-
loaded pop-ups are brought up with the pointer and, because
of the grab that the pointer button causes, require differ-
ent processing by the Intrinsics.  Furthermore, all user
input remap events occurring outside the spring-loaded pop-
up (e.g., in a descendant) are also delivered to the spring-
loaded pop-up after they have been dispatched to the appro-
priate descendant, so that, for example, button-up can take
down a spring-loaded pop-up no matter where the button-up
occurs.

Any kind of pop-up, in turn, can pop up other widgets.
Modal and spring-loaded pop-ups can constrain user events to
the most recent such pop-up or allow user events to be dis-
patched to any of the modal or spring-loaded pop-ups cur-
rently mapped.

Regardless of their type, all pop-up widget classes are
responsible for communicating with the X window manager and
therefore are subclasses of one of the Shell widget classes.


1m5.2.	Creating a Pop-Up Shell0m

For a widget to be popped up, it must be the child of a pop-
up shell widget.  None of the Intrinsics-supplied shells
will simultaneously manage more than one child.	 Both the
shell and child taken together are referred to as the pop-
up.  When you need to use a pop-up, you always refer to the
pop-up by the pop-up shell, not the child.


To create a pop-up shell, use 4mXtCreatePopupShell24m.












			     1m1310m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Widget XtCreatePopupShell(4mname24m, 4mwidget_class24m, 4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m)
      String 4mname24m;
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;
      Widget 4mparent24m;
      ArgList 4margs24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the instance name for the created shell
	  widget.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class pointer for the created
	  shell widget.

4mparent24m    Specifies the parent widget.  Must be of class
	  Core or any subclass thereof.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list to override any other
	  resource specifications.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

The 4mXtCreatePopupShell24m function ensures that the specified
class is a subclass of Shell and, rather than using
insert_child to attach the widget to the parent's 4mchildren0m
list, attaches the shell to the parent's 4mpopup_list0m
directly.

The screen resource for this widget is determined by first
scanning 4margs24m for the XtNscreen argument.	If no XtNscreen
argument is found, the resource database associated with the
parent's screen is queried for the resource 4mname24m.screen,
class 4mClass24m.Screen where 4mClass24m is the 4mclass_name24m field from
the 4mCoreClassPart24m of the specified 4mwidget_class24m.  If this
query fails, the parent's screen is used.  Once the screen
is determined, the resource database associated with that
screen is used to retrieve all remaining resources for the
widget not specified in 4margs24m.


A spring-loaded pop-up invoked from a translation table via
4mXtMenuPopup24m must already exist at the time that the transla-
tion is invoked, so the translation manager can find the
shell by name.	Pop-ups invoked in other ways can be created
when the pop-up actually is needed.  This delayed creation
of the shell is particularly useful when you pop up an
unspecified number of pop-ups.	You can look to see if an
appropriate unused shell (that is, not currently popped up)
exists and create a new shell if needed.




			     1m1320m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To create a pop-up shell using varargs lists, use 4mXtVaCre-0m
4matePopupShell24m.

__
|
Widget XtVaCreatePopupShell(4mname24m, 4mwidget_class24m, 4mparent24m, ...)
      String 4mname24m;
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;
      Widget 4mparent24m;


4mname24m      Specifies the instance name for the created shell
	  widget.

4mwidget_class0m
	  Specifies the widget class pointer for the created
	  shell widget.

4mparent24m    Specifies the parent widget.  Must be of class
	  Core or any subclass thereof.

...	  Specifies the variable argument list to override
	  any other resource specifications.
|__

4mXtVaCreatePopupShell24m is identical in function to 4mXtCre-0m
4matePopupShell24m with 4mthe24m args and 4mnum_args24m parameters replaced
by a varargs list as described in Section 2.5.1.


1m5.3.	Creating Pop-Up Children0m

Once a pop-up shell is created, the single child of the pop-
up shell can be created either statically or dynamically.

At startup, an application can create the child of the pop-
up shell, which is appropriate for pop-up children composed
of a fixed set of widgets.  The application can change the
state of the subparts of the pop-up child as the application
state changes.	For example, if an application creates a
static menu, it can call 4mXtSetSensitive24m (or, in general,
4mXtSetValues24m) on any of the buttons that make up the menu.
Creating the pop-up child early means that pop-up time is
minimized, especially if the application calls 4mXtRealizeWid-0m
4mget24m on the pop-up shell at startup.  When the menu is
needed, all the widgets that make up the menu already exist
and need only be mapped.  The menu should pop up as quickly
as the X server can respond.

Alternatively, an application can postpone the creation of
the child until it is needed, which minimizes application
startup time and allows the pop-up child to reconfigure
itself each time it is popped up.  In this case, the pop-up
child creation routine might poll the application to find



			     1m1330m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


out if it should change the sensitivity of any of its sub-
parts.

Pop-up child creation does not map the pop-up, even if you
create the child and call 4mXtRealizeWidget24m on the pop-up
shell.

All shells have pop-up and pop-down callbacks, which provide
the opportunity either to make last-minute changes to a pop-
up child before it is popped up or to change it after it is
popped down.  Note that excessive use of pop-up callbacks
can make popping up occur more slowly.


1m5.4.	Mapping a Pop-Up Widget0m

Pop-ups can be popped up through several mechanisms:

    A call to 4mXtPopup24m or 4mXtPopupSpringLoaded24m.

    One of the supplied callback procedures 4mXtCallbackNone24m,
     4mXtCallbackNonexclusive24m, or 4mXtCallbackExclusive24m.

    The standard translation action 4mXtMenuPopup24m.

Some of these routines take an argument of type 4mXtGrabKind24m,
which is defined as

__
|
typedef enum {XtGrabNone, XtGrabNonexclusive, XtGrabExclusive} XtGrabKind;

|__


The create_popup_child_proc procedure pointer in the shell
widget instance record is of type 4mXtCreatePopupChildProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtCreatePopupChildProc)(Widget);
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the shell widget being popped up.
|__

To map a pop-up from within an application, use 4mXtPopup24m.









			     1m1340m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtPopup(4mpopup_shell24m, 4mgrab_kind24m)
      Widget 4mpopup_shell24m;
      XtGrabKind 4mgrab_kind24m;


4mpopup_shell0m
	  Specifies the shell widget.

4mgrab_kind24m Specifies the way in which user events should be
	  constrained.
|__

The 4mXtPopup24m function performs the following:

    Calls 4mXtCheckSubclass24m to ensure 4mpopup_shell24m's class is
     a subclass of 4mshellWidgetClass24m.

    Raises the window and returns if the shell's 4mpopped_up0m
     field is already 4mTrue24m.

    Calls the callback procedures on the shell's
     4mpopup_callback24m list, specifying a pointer to the value
     of 4mgrab_kind24m as the 4mcall_data24m argument.

    Sets the shell 4mpopped_up24m field to 4mTrue24m, the shell
     4mspring_loaded24m field to 4mFalse24m, and the shell 4mgrab_kind0m
     field from 4mgrab_kind24m.

    If the shell's 4mcreate_popup_child_proc24m field is non-
     NULL, 4mXtPopup24m calls it with 4mpopup_shell24m as the parame-
     ter.

    If 4mgrab_kind24m is either 4mXtGrabNonexclusive24m or 4mXtGrabEx-0m
     4mclusive24m, it calls


     XtAddGrab(4mpopup_shell24m, (4mgrab_kind24m == XtGrabExclusive), False)


    Calls 4mXtRealizeWidget24m with 4mpopup_shell24m specified.

    Calls 4mXMapRaised24m with the window of 4mpopup_shell24m.


To map a spring-loaded pop-up from within an application,
use 4mXtPopupSpringLoaded24m.










			     1m1350m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtPopupSpringLoaded(4mpopup_shell24m)
      Widget 4mpopup_shell24m;


4mpopup_shell0m
	  Specifies the shell widget to be popped up.
|__

The 4mXtPopupSpringLoaded24m function performs exactly as 4mXtPopup0m
except that it sets the shell 4mspring_loaded24m field to 4mTrue0m
and always calls 4mXtAddGrab24m with 4mexclusive24m 4mTrue24m and 4mspring-0m
4mloaded24m 4mTrue24m.


To map a pop-up from a given widget's callback list, you
also can register one of the 4mXtCallbackNone24m, 4mXtCallbac-0m
4mkNonexclusive24m, or 4mXtCallbackExclusive24m convenience routines
as callbacks, using the pop-up shell widget as the client
data.

      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the pop-up shell.

4mcall_data24m Specifies the callback data argument, which is not
	  used by this procedure.
|__

The 4mXtCallbackNone24m, 4mXtCallbackNonexclusive24m, and 4mXtCallback-0m
4mExclusive24m functions call 4mXtPopup24m with the shell specified by
the 4mclient_data24m argument and 4mgrab_kind24m set as the name spec-
ifies.	4mXtCallbackNone24m, 4mXtCallbackNonexclusive24m, and 4mXtCall-0m
4mbackExclusive24m specify 4mXtGrabNone24m, 4mXtGrabNonexclusive24m, and
4mXtGrabExclusive24m, respectively.  Each function then sets the



			     1m1370m

widget that executed the callback list to be insensitive by
calling 4mXtSetSensitive24m.  Using these functions in callbacks
is not required.  In particular, an application must provide
customized code for callbacks that create pop-up shells
dynamically or that must do more than desensitizing the but-
ton.


Within a translation table, to pop up a menu when a key or
pointer button is pressed or when the pointer is moved into
a widget, use 4mXtMenuPopup24m, or its synonym, 4mMenuPopup24m.	 From
a translation writer's point of view, the definition for
this translation action is

__
|
void XtMenuPopup(4mshell_name24m)
      String 4mshell_name24m;


4mshell_name0m
	  Specifies the name of the shell widget to pop up.
|__

4mXtMenuPopup24m is known to the translation manager, which reg-
isters the corresponding built-in action procedure
4mXtMenuPopupAction24m using 4mXtRegisterGrabAction24m specifying
4mowner_events24m 4mTrue24m, 4mevent_mask24m 4mButtonPressMask24m 1m| 4m22mButtonRe-0m
4mleaseMask24m, and 4mpointer_mode24m and 4mkeyboard_mode24m 4mGrabModeAsync24m.

If 4mXtMenuPopup24m is invoked on 4mButtonPress24m, it calls 4mXtPopup-0m
4mSpringLoaded24m on the specified shell widget.  If 4mXtMenuPopup0m
is invoked on 4mKeyPress24m or 4mEnterWindow24m, it calls 4mXtPopup24m on
the specified shell widget with 4mgrab_kind24m set to 4mXtGrab-0m
4mNonexclusive24m.  Otherwise, the translation manager generates
a warning message and ignores the action.

4mXtMenuPopup24m tries to find the shell by searching the widget
tree starting at the widget in which it is invoked.  If it
finds a shell with the specified name in the pop-up children
of that widget, it pops up the shell with the appropriate
parameters.  Otherwise, it moves up the parent chain to find
a pop-up child with the specified name.	 If 4mXtMenuPopup24m gets
to the application top-level shell widget and has not found
a matching shell, it generates a warning and returns immedi-
ately.


1m5.5.	Unmapping a Pop-Up Widget0m

Pop-ups can be popped down through several mechanisms:

    A call to 4mXtPopdown0m




			     1m1380m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    The supplied callback procedure 4mXtCallbackPopdown0m

    The standard translation action 4mXtMenuPopdown0m


To unmap a pop-up from within an application, use 4mXtPopdown24m.

__
|
void XtPopdown(4mpopup_shell24m)
      Widget 4mpopup_shell24m;


4mpopup_shell0m
	  Specifies the shell widget to pop down.
|__

The 4mXtPopdown24m function performs the following:

    Calls 4mXtCheckSubclass24m to ensure 4mpopup_shell24m's class is
     a subclass of 4mshellWidgetClass24m.

    Checks that the 4mpopped_up24m field of 4mpopup_shell24m is 4mTrue24m;
     otherwise, it returns immediately.

    Unmaps 4mpopup_shell24m's window and, if 4moverride_redirect0m
     is 4mFalse24m, sends a synthetic 4mUnmapNotify24m event as speci-
     fied by the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mMan-0m
     4mual24m.

    If 4mpopup_shell24m's 4mgrab_kind24m is either 4mXtGrabNonexclusive0m
     or 4mXtGrabExclusive24m, it calls 4mXtRemoveGrab24m.

    Sets 4mpopup_shell24m's 4mpopped_up24m field to 4mFalse24m.

    Calls the callback procedures on the shell's 4mpop-0m
     4mdown_callback24m list, specifying a pointer to the value
     of the shell's 4mgrab_kind24m field as the 4mcall_data24m argu-
     ment.


To pop down a pop-up from a callback list, you may use the
callback 4mXtCallbackPopdown24m.

      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies a pointer to the 4mXtPopdownID24m structure.

4mcall_data24m Specifies the callback data argument, which is not
	  used by this procedure.
|__

The 4mXtCallbackPopdown24m function casts the 4mclient_data24m parame-
ter to a pointer of type 4mXtPopdownID24m.

__
|
typedef struct {
     Widget shell_widget;
     Widget enable_widget;
} XtPopdownIDRec, *XtPopdownID;

|__

The 4mshell_widget24m is the pop-up shell to pop down, and the
4menable_widget24m is usually the widget that was used to pop it
up in one of the pop-up callback convenience procedures.

4mXtCallbackPopdown24m calls 4mXtPopdown24m with the specified
4mshell_widget24m and then calls 4mXtSetSensitive24m to resensitize
4menable_widget24m.


Within a translation table, to pop down a spring-loaded menu
when a key or pointer button is released or when the pointer
is moved into a widget, use 4mXtMenuPopdown24m or its synonym,
4mMenuPopdown24m.  From a translation writer's point of view, the
definition for this translation action is

void XtMenuPopdown(4mshell_name24m)
      String 4mshell_name24m;


4mshell_name0m
	  Specifies the name of the shell widget to pop
	  down.
|__

If a shell name is not given, 4mXtMenuPopdown24m calls 4mXtPopdown0m
with the widget for which the translation is specified.	 If
4mshell_name24m is specified in the translation table, 4mXtMenuPop-0m
4mdown24m tries to find the shell by looking up the widget tree
starting at the widget in which it is invoked.	If it finds
a shell with the specified name in the pop-up children of
that widget, it pops down the shell; otherwise, it moves up
the parent chain to find a pop-up child with the specified
name.  If 4mXtMenuPopdown24m gets to the application top-level
shell widget and cannot find a matching shell, it generates
a warning and returns immediately.

		    1mGeometry Management0m




A widget does not directly control its size and location;
rather, its parent is responsible for controlling them.
Although the position of children is usually left up to
their parent, the widgets themselves often have the best
idea of their optimal sizes and, possibly, preferred loca-
tions.

To resolve physical layout conflicts between sibling widgets
and between a widget and its parent, the Intrinsics provide
the geometry management mechanism.  Almost all composite
widgets have a geometry manager specified in the 4mgeome-0m
4mtry_manager24m field in the widget class record that is respon-
sible for the size, position, and stacking order of the wid-
get's children.	 The only exception is fixed boxes, which
create their children themselves and can ensure that their
children will never make a geometry request.


1m6.1.	Initiating Geometry Changes0m

Parents, children, and clients each initiate geometry
changes differently.  Because a parent has absolute control
of its children's geometry, it changes the geometry directly
by calling 4mXtMoveWidget24m, 4mXtResizeWidget24m, or 4mXtConfigureWid-0m
4mget24m.  A child must ask its parent for a geometry change by
calling 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m or 4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m.	 An
application or other client code initiates a geometry change
by calling 4mXtSetValues24m on the appropriate geometry fields,
thereby giving the widget the opportunity to modify or
reject the client request before it gets propagated to the
parent and the opportunity to respond appropriately to the
parent's reply.

When a widget that needs to change its size, position, bor-
der width, or stacking depth asks its parent's geometry man-
ager to make the desired changes, the geometry manager can
allow the request, disallow the request, or suggest a com-
promise.

When the geometry manager is asked to change the geometry of
a child, the geometry manager may also rearrange and resize
any or all of the other children that it controls.  The
geometry manager can move children around freely using
4mXtMoveWidget24m.  When it resizes a child (that is, changes the
width, height, or border width) other than the one making



			     1m1420m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


the request, it should do so by calling 4mXtResizeWidget24m.  The
requesting child may be given special treatment; see Section
6.5.  It can simultaneously move and resize a child with a
single call to 4mXtConfigureWidget24m.

Often, geometry managers find that they can satisfy a
request only if they can reconfigure a widget that they are
not in control of; in particular, the composite widget may
want to change its own size.  In this case, the geometry
manager makes a request to its parent's geometry manager.
Geometry requests can cascade this way to arbitrary depth.

Because such cascaded arbitration of widget geometry can
involve extended negotiation, windows are not actually allo-
cated to widgets at application startup until all widgets
are satisfied with their geometry; see Sections 2.5 and 2.6.

			   Notes


     1.	  The Intrinsics treatment of stacking requests
	  is deficient in several areas.  Stacking
	  requests for unrealized widgets are granted
	  but will have no effect.  In addition, there
	  is no way to do an 4mXtSetValues24m that will gen-
	  erate a stacking geometry request.

     2.	  After a successful geometry request (one that
	  returned 4mXtGeometryYes24m), a widget does not
	  know whether its resize procedure has been
	  called.  Widgets should have resize proce-
	  dures that can be called more than once with-
	  out ill effects.



1m6.2.	General Geometry Manager Requests0m

When making a geometry request, the child specifies an
4mXtWidgetGeometry24m structure.

















			     1m1430m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef unsigned long XtGeometryMask;

typedef struct {
     XtGeometryMask request_mode;
     Position x, y;
     Dimension width, height;
     Dimension border_width;
     Widget sibling;
     int stack_mode;
} XtWidgetGeometry;
|__


To make a general geometry manager request from a widget,
use 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m.

__
|
XtGeometryResult XtMakeGeometryRequest(4mw24m, 4mrequest24m, 4mreply_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mrequest24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mreply_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget making the request.	 Must be
	  of class RectObj or any subclass thereof.

4mrequest24m   Specifies the desired widget geometry (size, posi-
	  tion, border width, and stacking order).

4mreply_return0m
	  Returns the allowed widget size, or may be NULL if
	  the requesting widget is not interested in han-
	  dling 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m.
|__

Depending on the condition, 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m performs
the following:

    If the widget is unmanaged or the widget's parent is
     not realized, it makes the changes and returns 4mXtGeome-0m
     4mtryYes24m.

    If the parent's class is not a subclass of 4mcompos-0m
     4miteWidgetClass24m or the parent's 4mgeometry_manager24m field
     is NULL, it issues an error.

    If the widget's 4mbeing_destroyed24m field is 4mTrue24m, it
     returns 4mXtGeometryNo24m.

    If the widget 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width0m
     fields are all equal to the requested values, it
     returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m; otherwise, it calls the parent's



			     1m1440m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     geometry_manager procedure with the given parameters.

    If the parent's geometry manager returns 4mXtGeometryYes0m
     and if 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is not set in
     4mrequest->request_mode24m and if the widget is realized,
     4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m calls the 4mXConfigureWindow24m Xlib
     function to reconfigure the widget's window (set its
     size, location, and stacking order as appropriate).

    If the geometry manager returns 4mXtGeometryDone24m, the
     change has been approved and actually has been done.
     In this case, 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m does no configuring
     and returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m.  4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m never
     returns 4mXtGeometryDone24m.

    Otherwise, 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m just returns the
     resulting value from the parent's geometry manager.

Children of primitive widgets are always unmanaged; there-
fore, 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m always returns 4mXtGeometryYes0m
when called by a child of a primitive widget.

The return codes from geometry managers are

     XtGeometryYes,
     XtGeometryNo,
     XtGeometryAlmost,
     XtGeometryDone
} XtGeometryResult;

4mXtCWQueryOnly24m indicates that the corresponding geometry
request is only a query as to what would happen if this
geometry request were made and that no widgets should actu-
ally be changed.

4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m, like the 4mXConfigureWindow24m Xlib func-
tion, uses 4mrequest_mode24m to determine which fields in the
4mXtWidgetGeometry24m structure the caller wants to specify.

4mInterface24m.	 4mXtSMDontChange24m indicates that the widget wants
its current stacking order preserved.


1m6.3.	Resize Requests0m

To make a simple resize request from a widget, you can use
4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m as an alternative to 4mXtMakeGeometry-0m
4mRequest24m.












			     1m1460m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
XtGeometryResult XtMakeResizeRequest(4mw24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, 4mwidth_return24m, 4mheight_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Dimension 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m;
      Dimension *4mwidth_return24m, *4mheight_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget making the request.	 Must be
	  of class RectObj or any subclass thereof.

4mwidth24m     Specify the desired widget width and height.
4mheight0m

4mwidth_return0m
	  Return the allowed widget width and height.
4mheight_return0m
|__

The 4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m function, a simple interface to
4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m, creates an 4mXtWidgetGeometry24m structure
and specifies that width and height should change by setting
4mrequest_mode24m to 4mCWWidth24m 1m| 4m22mCWHeight24m.	 The geometry manager is
free to modify any of the other window attributes (position
or stacking order) to satisfy the resize request.  If the
return value is 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m, 4mwidth_return24m and
4mheight_return24m contain a compromise width and height.  If
these are acceptable, the widget should immediately call
4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m again and request that the compromise
width and height be applied.  If the widget is not inter-
ested in 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m replies, it can pass NULL for
4mwidth_return24m and 4mheight_return24m.


1m6.4.	Potential Geometry Changes0m

Sometimes a geometry manager cannot respond to a geometry
request from a child without first making a geometry request
to the widget's own parent (the original requestor's grand-
parent).  If the request to the grandparent would allow the
parent to satisfy the original request, the geometry manager
can make the intermediate geometry request as if it were the
originator.  On the other hand, if the geometry manager
already has determined that the original request cannot be
completely satisfied (for example, if it always denies posi-
tion changes), it needs to tell the grandparent to respond
to the intermediate request without actually changing the
geometry because it does not know if the child will accept
the compromise.	 To accomplish this, the geometry manager
uses 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m in the intermediate request.

When 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is used, the geometry manager needs to
cache enough information to exactly reconstruct the interme-
diate request.	If the grandparent's response to the inter-
mediate query was 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m, the geometry manager



			     1m1470m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


needs to cache the entire reply geometry in the event the
child accepts the parent's compromise.

If the grandparent's response was 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m, it may
also be necessary to cache the entire reply geometry from
the grandparent when 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is not used.  If the
geometry manager is still able to satisfy the original
request, it may immediately accept the grandparent's compro-
mise and then act on the child's request.  If the grandpar-
ent's compromise geometry is insufficient to allow the
child's request and if the geometry manager is willing to
offer a different compromise to the child, the grandparent's
compromise should not be accepted until the child has
accepted the new compromise.

Note that a compromise geometry returned with 4mXtGeometryAl-0m
4mmost24m is guaranteed only for the next call to the same wid-
get; therefore, a cache of size 1 is sufficient.


1m6.5.	Child Geometry Management: The geometry_manager Proce-0m
1mdure0m

The geometry_manager procedure pointer in a composite widget
class is of type 4mXtGeometryHandler24m.

__
|
typedef XtGeometryResult (*XtGeometryHandler)(Widget, XtWidgetGeometry*, XtWidgetGeometry*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mrequest24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mgeometry_return24m;


4mw24m		 Passes the widget making the request.

4mrequest24m	 Passes the new geometry the child desires.

4mgeometry_return0m
	    Passes a geometry structure in which the geome-
	    try manager may store a compromise.
|__

A class can inherit its superclass's geometry manager during
class initialization.

A bit set to zero in the request's 4mrequest_mode24m field means
that the child widget does not care about the value of the
corresponding field, so the geometry manager can change this
field as it wishes.  A bit set to 1 means that the child
wants that geometry element set to the value in the corre-
sponding field.





			     1m1480m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


If the geometry manager can satisfy all changes requested
and if 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is not specified, it updates the wid-
get's 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m fields appropri-
ately.	Then, it returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m, and the values
pointed to by the 4mgeometry_return24m argument are undefined.
The widget's window is moved and resized automatically by
4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m.

Homogeneous composite widgets often find it convenient to
treat the widget making the request the same as any other
widget, including reconfiguring it using 4mXtConfigureWidget0m
or 4mXtResizeWidget24m as part of its layout process, unless
4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is specified.  If it does this, it should
return 4mXtGeometryDone24m to inform 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m that
it does not need to do the configuration itself.

			    Note

     To remain compatible with layout techniques used
     in older widgets (before 4mXtGeometryDone24m was added
     to the Intrinsics), a geometry manager should
     avoid using 4mXtResizeWidget24m or 4mXtConfigureWidget24m on
     the child making the request because the layout
     process of the child may be in an intermediate
     state in which it is not prepared to handle a call
     to its resize procedure.  A self-contained widget
     set may choose this alternative geometry manage-
     ment scheme, however, provided that it clearly
     warns widget developers of the compatibility con-
     sequences.


Although 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m resizes the widget's window
(if the geometry manager returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m), it does not
call the widget class's resize procedure.  The requesting
widget must perform whatever resizing calculations are
needed explicitly.

If the geometry manager disallows the request, the widget
cannot change its geometry.  The values pointed to by 4mgeome-0m
4mtry_return24m are undefined, and the geometry manager returns
4mXtGeometryNo24m.

Sometimes the geometry manager cannot satisfy the request
exactly but may be able to satisfy a similar request.  That
is, it could satisfy only a subset of the requests (for
example, size but not position) or a lesser request (for
example, it cannot make the child as big as the request but
it can make the child bigger than its current size).  In
such cases, the geometry manager fills in the structure
pointed to by 4mgeometry_return24m with the actual changes it is
willing to make, including an appropriate 4mrequest_mode24m mask,
and returns 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m.  If a bit in 4mgeome-0m
4mtry_return->request_mode24m is zero, the geometry manager



			     1m1490m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


agrees not to change the corresponding value if 4mgeome-0m
4mtry_return24m is used immediately in a new request.  If a bit
is 1, the geometry manager does change that element to the
corresponding value in 4mgeometry_return24m.  More bits may be
set in 4mgeometry_return->request_mode24m than in the original
request if the geometry manager intends to change other
fields should the child accept the compromise.

When 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m is returned, the widget must decide if
the compromise suggested in 4mgeometry_return24m is acceptable.
If it is, the widget must not change its geometry directly;
rather, it must make another call to 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m.

If the next geometry request from this child uses the 4mgeome-0m
4mtry_return24m values filled in by the geometry manager with an
4mXtGeometryAlmost24m return and if there have been no interven-
ing geometry requests on either its parent or any of its
other children, the geometry manager must grant the request,
if possible.  That is, if the child asks immediately with
the returned geometry, it should get an answer of 4mXtGeome-0m
4mtryYes24m.  However, dynamic behavior in the user's window man-
ager may affect the final outcome.

To return 4mXtGeometryYes24m, the geometry manager frequently
rearranges the position of other managed children by calling
4mXtMoveWidget24m.  However, a few geometry managers may some-
times change the size of other managed children by calling
4mXtResizeWidget24m or 4mXtConfigureWidget24m.	If 4mXtCWQueryOnly24m is
specified, the geometry manager must return data describing
how it would react to this geometry request without actually
moving or resizing any widgets.

Geometry managers must not assume that the 4mrequest24m and 4mgeom-0m
4metry_return24m arguments point to independent storage.  The
caller is permitted to use the same field for both, and the
geometry manager must allocate its own temporary storage, if
necessary.


1m6.6.	Widget Placement and Sizing0m

To move a sibling widget of the child making the geometry
request, the parent uses 4mXtMoveWidget24m.














			     1m1500m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtMoveWidget(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m;
      Position 4my24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mx0m
4my24m	       Specify the new widget x and y coordinates.
|__

The 4mXtMoveWidget24m function returns immediately if the speci-
fied geometry fields are the same as the old values.  Other-
wise, 4mXtMoveWidget24m writes the new 4mx24m and 4my24m values into the
object and, if the object is a widget and is realized,
issues an Xlib 4mXMoveWindow24m call on the widget's window.


To resize a sibling widget of the child making the geometry
request, the parent uses 4mXtResizeWidget24m.

__
|
void XtResizeWidget(4mw24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, 4mborder_width24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Dimension 4mwidth24m;
      Dimension 4mheight24m;
      Dimension 4mborder_width24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mwidth0m
4mheight0m
4mborder_width0m
	  Specify the new widget size.
|__

The 4mXtResizeWidget24m function returns immediately if the spec-
ified geometry fields are the same as the old values.  Oth-
erwise, 4mXtResizeWidget24m writes the new 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and
4mborder_width24m values into the object and, if the object is a
widget and is realized, issues an 4mXConfigureWindow24m call on
the widget's window.

If the new width or height is different from the old values,
4mXtResizeWidget24m calls the object's resize procedure to notify
it of the size change.





			     1m1510m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


To move and resize the sibling widget of the child making
the geometry request, the parent uses 4mXtConfigureWidget24m.

__
|
void XtConfigureWidget(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, 4mborder_width24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m;
      Position 4my24m;
      Dimension 4mwidth24m;
      Dimension 4mheight24m;
      Dimension 4mborder_width24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mx0m
4my24m	       Specify the new widget x and y coordinates.

4mwidth0m
4mheight0m
4mborder_width0m
	  Specify the new widget size.
|__

The 4mXtConfigureWidget24m function returns immediately if the
specified new geometry fields are all equal to the current
values.	 Otherwise, 4mXtConfigureWidget24m writes the new 4mx24m, 4my24m,
4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m values into the object and,
if the object is a widget and is realized, makes an Xlib
4mXConfigureWindow24m call on the widget's window.

If the new width or height is different from its old value,
4mXtConfigureWidget24m calls the object's resize procedure to
notify it of the size change; otherwise, it simply returns.


To resize a child widget that already has the new values of
its width, height, and border width, the parent uses 4mXtRe-0m
4msizeWindow24m.

__
|
void XtResizeWindow(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtResizeWindow24m function calls the 4mXConfigureWindow24m Xlib
function to make the window of the specified widget match



			     1m1520m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


its width, height, and border width.  This request is done
unconditionally because there is no inexpensive way to tell
if these values match the current values.  Note that the
widget's resize procedure is not called.

There are very few times to use 4mXtResizeWindow24m; instead, the
parent should use 4mXtResizeWidget24m.


1m6.7.	Preferred Geometry0m

Some parents may be willing to adjust their layouts to
accommodate the preferred geometries of their children.
They can use 4mXtQueryGeometry24m to obtain the preferred geome-
try and, as they see fit, can use or ignore any portion of
the response.


To query a child widget's preferred geometry, use 4mXtQuery-0m
4mGeometry24m.

__
|
XtGeometryResult XtQueryGeometry(4mw24m, 4mintended24m, 4mpreferred_return24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;
     XtWidgetGeometry *4mintended24m;
     XtWidgetGeometry *4mpreferred_return24m;


4mw24m		Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj
	   or any subclass thereof.

4mintended24m	Specifies the new geometry the parent plans to
	   give to the child, or NULL.

4mpreferred_return0m
	   Returns the child widget's preferred geometry.
|__

To discover a child's preferred geometry, the child's parent
stores the new geometry in the corresponding fields of the
intended structure, sets the corresponding bits in
4mintended.request_mode24m, and calls 4mXtQueryGeometry24m.  The par-
ent should set only those fields that are important to it so
that the child can determine whether it may be able to
attempt changes to other fields.

4mXtQueryGeometry24m clears all bits in the 4mpre-0m
4mferred_return->request_mode24m field and checks the 4mquery_geom-0m
4metry24m field of the specified widget's class record.	 If
4mquery_geometry24m is not NULL, 4mXtQueryGeometry24m calls the
query_geometry procedure and passes as arguments the speci-
fied widget, 4mintended24m, and 4mpreferred_return24m structures.  If
the 4mintended24m argument is NULL, 4mXtQueryGeometry24m replaces it



			     1m1530m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


with a pointer to an 4mXtWidgetGeometry24m structure with
4mrequest_mode24m equal to zero before calling the query_geometry
procedure.

			    Note

     If 4mXtQueryGeometry24m is called from within a geome-
     try_manager procedure for the widget that issued
     4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m or 4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m, the
     results are not guaranteed to be consistent with
     the requested changes.  The change request passed
     to the geometry manager takes precedence over the
     preferred geometry.



The query_geometry procedure pointer is of type 4mXtGeometry-0m
4mHandler24m.

__
|
typedef XtGeometryResult (*XtGeometryHandler)(Widget, XtWidgetGeometry*, XtWidgetGeometry*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mrequest24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mpreferred_return24m;


4mw24m		 Passes the child widget whose preferred geometry
	    is required.

4mrequest24m	 Passes the geometry changes that the parent
	    plans to make.

4mpreferred_return0m
	    Passes a structure in which the child returns
	    its preferred geometry.
|__

The query_geometry procedure is expected to examine the bits
set in 4mrequest->request_mode24m, evaluate the preferred geome-
try of the widget, and store the result in 4mpreferred_return0m
(setting the bits in 4mpreferred_return->request_mode24m corre-
sponding to those geometry fields that it cares about).	 If
the proposed geometry change is acceptable without modifica-
tion, the query_geometry procedure should return 4mXtGeome-0m
4mtryYes24m.  If at least one field in 4mpreferred_return24m with a
bit set in 4mpreferred_return->request_mode24m is different from
the corresponding field in 4mrequest24m or if a bit was set in
4mpreferred_return->request_mode24m that was not set in the
request, the query_geometry procedure should return 4mXtGeome-0m
4mtryAlmost24m.	 If the preferred geometry is identical to the
current geometry, the query_geometry procedure should return
4mXtGeometryNo24m.




			     1m1540m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


			    Note

     The query_geometry procedure may assume that no
     4mXtMakeResizeRequest24m or 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m is in
     progress for the specified widget; that is, it is
     not required to construct a reply consistent with
     the requested geometry if such a request were
     actually outstanding.


After calling the query_geometry procedure or if the
4mquery_geometry24m field is NULL, 4mXtQueryGeometry24m examines all
the unset bits in 4mpreferred_return->request_mode24m and sets
the corresponding fields in 4mpreferred_return24m to the current
values from the widget instance.  If 4mCWStackMode24m is not set,
the 4mstack_mode24m field is set to 4mXtSMDontChange24m.  4mXtQuery-0m
4mGeometry24m returns the value returned by the query_geometry
procedure or 4mXtGeometryYes24m if the 4mquery_geometry24m field is
NULL.

Therefore, the caller can interpret a return of 4mXtGeome-0m
4mtryYes24m as not needing to evaluate the contents of the reply
and, more important, not needing to modify its layout plans.
A return of 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m means either that both the par-
ent and the child expressed interest in at least one common
field and the child's preference does not match the parent's
intentions or that the child expressed interest in a field
that the parent might need to consider.	 A return value of
4mXtGeometryNo24m means that both the parent and the child
expressed interest in a field and that the child suggests
that the field's current value in the widget instance is its
preferred value.  In addition, whether or not the caller
ignores the return value or the reply mask, it is guaranteed
that the 4mpreferred_return24m structure contains complete geome-
try information for the child.

Parents are expected to call 4mXtQueryGeometry24m in their layout
routine and wherever else the information is significant
after change_managed has been called.  The first time it is
invoked, the changed_managed procedure may assume that the
child's current geometry is its preferred geometry.  Thus,
the child is still responsible for storing values into its
own geometry during its initialize procedure.


1m6.8.	Size Change Management: The resize Procedure0m

A child can be resized by its parent at any time.  Widgets
usually need to know when they have changed size so that
they can lay out their displayed data again to match the new
size.  When a parent resizes a child, it calls 4mXtResizeWid-0m
4mget24m, which updates the geometry fields in the widget, con-
figures the window if the widget is realized, and calls the
child's resize procedure to notify the child.  The resize



			     1m1550m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


procedure pointer is of type 4mXtWidgetProc24m.

If a class need not recalculate anything when a widget is
resized, it can specify NULL for the 4mresize24m field in its
class record.  This is an unusual case and should occur only
for widgets with very trivial display semantics.  The resize
procedure takes a widget as its only argument.	The 4mx24m, 4my24m,
4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width24m fields of the widget contain
the new values.	 The resize procedure should recalculate the
layout of internal data as needed.  (For example, a centered
Label in a window that changes size should recalculate the
starting position of the text.)	 The widget must obey resize
as a command and must not treat it as a request.  A widget
must not issue an 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m or 4mXtMakeResiz-0m
4meRequest24m call from its resize procedure.

		      1mEvent Management0m



While Xlib allows the reading and processing of events any-
where in an application, widgets in the X Toolkit neither
directly read events nor grab the server or pointer.  Wid-
gets register procedures that are to be called when an event
or class of events occurs in that widget.

A typical application consists of startup code followed by
an event loop that reads events and dispatches them by call-
ing the procedures that widgets have registered.  The
default event loop provided by the Intrinsics is 4mXtAppMain-0m
4mLoop24m.

The event manager is a collection of functions to perform
the following tasks:

    Add or remove event sources other than X server events
     (in particular, timer interrupts, file input, or POSIX
     signals).

    Query the status of event sources.

    Add or remove procedures to be called when an event
     occurs for a particular widget.

    Enable and disable the dispatching of user-initiated
     events (keyboard and pointer events) for a particular
     widget.

    Constrain the dispatching of events to a cascade of
     pop-up widgets.

    Register procedures to be called when specific events
     arrive.

    Register procedures to be called when the Intrinsics
     will block.

    Enable safe operation in a multi-threaded environment.

Most widgets do not need to call any of the event handler
functions explicitly.  The normal interface to X events is
through the higher-level translation manager, which maps
sequences of X events, with modifiers, into procedure calls.
Applications rarely use any of the event manager routines
besides 4mXtAppMainLoop24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m7.1.	Adding and Deleting Additional Event Sources0m

While most applications are driven only by X events, some
applications need to incorporate other sources of input into
the Intrinsics event-handling mechanism.  The event manager
provides routines to integrate notification of timer events
and file data pending into this mechanism.

The next section describes functions that provide input
gathering from files.  The application registers the files
with the Intrinsics read routine.  When input is pending on
one of the files, the registered callback procedures are
invoked.


1m7.1.1.  Adding and Removing Input Sources0m

To register a new file as an input source for a given appli-
cation context, use 4mXtAppAddInput24m.

__
|
XtInputId XtAppAddInput(4mapp_context24m, 4msource24m, 4mcondition24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      int 4msource24m;
      XtPointer 4mcondition24m;
      XtInputCallbackProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4msource24m    Specifies the source file descriptor on a POSIX-
	  based system or other operating-system-dependent
	  device specification.

4mcondition24m Specifies the mask that indicates a read, write,
	  or exception condition or some other operating-
	  system-dependent condition.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called when the con-
	  dition is found.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies an argument passed to the specified pro-
	  cedure when it is called.
|__

The 4mXtAppAddInput24m function registers with the Intrinsics
read routine a new source of events, which is usually file
input but can also be file output.  Note that 4mfile24m should be
loosely interpreted to mean any sink or source of data.



			     1m1580m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtAppAddInput24m also specifies the conditions under which the
source can generate events.  When an event is pending on
this source, the callback procedure is called.

The legal values for the 4mcondition24m argument are operating-
system-dependent.  On a POSIX-based system, 4msource24m is a file
number and the condition is some union of the following:

1mXtInputReadMask0m
	       Specifies that 4mproc24m is to be called when
	       4msource24m has data to be read.

1mXtInputWriteMask0m
	       Specifies that 4mproc24m is to be called when
	       4msource24m is ready for writing.

1mXtInputExceptMask0m
	       Specifies that 4mproc24m is to be called when
	       4msource24m has exception data.

Callback procedure pointers used to handle file events are
of type 4mXtInputCallbackProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtInputCallbackProc)(XtPointer, int*, XtInputId*);
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
      int *4msource24m;
      XtInputId *4mid24m;


4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the client data argument that was regis-
	  tered for this procedure in 4mXtAppAddInput24m.

4msource24m    Passes the source file descriptor generating the
	  event.

4mid24m	       Passes the id returned from the corresponding
	  4mXtAppAddInput24m call.
|__

See Section 7.12 for information regarding the use of 4mXtAp-0m
4mpAddInput24m in multiple threads.


To discontinue a source of input, use 4mXtRemoveInput24m.










			     1m1590m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtRemoveInput(4mid24m)
      XtInputId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies the id returned from the corresponding
	  4mXtAppAddInput24m call.
|__

The 4mXtRemoveInput24m function causes the Intrinsics read rou-
tine to stop watching for events from the file source speci-
fied by 4mid24m.

See Section 7.12 for information regarding the use of
4mXtRemoveInput24m in multiple threads.


1m7.1.2.  Adding and Removing Blocking Notifications0m

Occasionally it is desirable for an application to receive
notification when the Intrinsics event manager detects no
pending input from file sources and no pending input from X
server event sources and is about to block in an operating
system call.


To register a hook that is called immediately prior to event
blocking, use 4mXtAppAddBlockHook24m.

__
|
XtBlockHookId XtAppAddBlockHook(4mapp_context24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtBlockHookProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called before block-
	  ing.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies an argument passed to the specified pro-
	  cedure when it is called.
|__

The 4mXtAppAddBlockHook24m function registers the specified pro-
cedure and returns an identifier for it.  The hook procedure
4mproc24m is called at any time in the future when the Intrinsics
are about to block pending some input.




			     1m1600m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


The procedure pointers used to provide notification of event
blocking are of type 4mXtBlockHookProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtBlockHookProc)(XtPointer);
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the client data argument that was regis-
	  tered for this procedure in 4mXtAppAddBlockHook24m.
|__

To discontinue the use of a procedure for blocking notifica-
tion, use 4mXtRemoveBlockHook24m.

__
|
void XtRemoveBlockHook(4mid24m)
      XtBlockHookId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies the identifier returned from the corre-
	  sponding call to 4mXtAppAddBlockHook24m.
|__

The 4mXtRemoveBlockHook24m function removes the specified proce-
dure from the list of procedures that are called by the
Intrinsics read routine before blocking on event sources.


1m7.1.3.  Adding and Removing Timeouts0m

The timeout facility notifies the application or the widget
through a callback procedure that a specified time interval
has elapsed.  Timeout values are uniquely identified by an
interval id.


To register a timeout callback, use 4mXtAppAddTimeOut24m.
















			     1m1610m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
XtIntervalId XtAppAddTimeOut(4mapp_context24m, 4minterval24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      unsigned long 4minterval24m;
      XtTimerCallbackProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context for which the
	  timer is to be set.

4minterval24m  Specifies the time interval in milliseconds.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called when the time
	  expires.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies an argument passed to the specified pro-
	  cedure when it is called.
|__

The 4mXtAppAddTimeOut24m function creates a timeout and returns
an identifier for it.  The timeout value is set to 4minterval24m.
The callback procedure 4mproc24m is called when 4mXtAppNextEvent24m or
4mXtAppProcessEvent24m is next called after the time interval
elapses, and then the timeout is removed.

Callback procedure pointers used with timeouts are of type
4mXtTimerCallbackProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtTimerCallbackProc)(XtPointer, XtIntervalId*);
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
      XtIntervalId *4mtimer24m;


4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the client data argument that was regis-
	  tered for this procedure in 4mXtAppAddTimeOut24m.

4mtimer24m     Passes the id returned from the corresponding
	  4mXtAppAddTimeOut24m call.
|__

See Section 7.12 for information regarding the use of 4mXtAp-0m
4mpAddTimeOut24m in multiple threads.


To clear a timeout value, use 4mXtRemoveTimeOut24m.






			     1m1620m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtRemoveTimeOut(4mtimer24m)
      XtIntervalId 4mtimer24m;


4mtimer24m     Specifies the id for the timeout request to be
	  cleared.
|__

The 4mXtRemoveTimeOut24m function removes the pending timeout.
Note that timeouts are automatically removed once they trig-
ger.

Please refer to Section 7.12 for information regarding the
use of 4mXtRemoveTimeOut24m in multiple threads.


1m7.1.4.  Adding and Removing Signal Callbacks0m

The signal facility notifies the application or the widget
through a callback procedure that a signal or other external
asynchronous event has occurred.  The registered callback
procedures are uniquely identified by a signal id.


Prior to establishing a signal handler, the application or
widget should call 4mXtAppAddSignal24m and store the resulting
identifier in a place accessible to the signal handler.
When a signal arrives, the signal handler should call 4mXtNo-0m
4mticeSignal24m to notify the Intrinsics that a signal has
occured.  To register a signal callback use 4mXtAppAddSignal24m.

__
|
XtSignalId XtAppAddSignal(4mapp_context24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtSignalCallbackProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called when the sig-
	  nal is noticed.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies an argument passed to the specified pro-
	  cedure when it is called.
|__

The callback procedure pointers used to handle signal events
are of type 4mXtSignalCallbackProc24m.



			     1m1630m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtSignalCallbackProc)(XtPointer, XtSignalId*);
     XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
     XtSignalId *4mid24m;


4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the client data argument that was regis-
	  tered for this procedure in 4mXtAppAddSignal24m.

4mid24m	       Passes the id returned from the corresponding
	  4mXtAppAddSignal24m call.
|__

To notify the Intrinsics that a signal has occured, use
4mXtNoticeSignal24m.


__
|
void XtNoticeSignal(4mid24m)
      XtSignalId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies the id returned from the corresponding
	  4mXtAppAddSignal24m call.
|__

On a POSIX-based system, 4mXtNoticeSignal24m is the only Intrin-
sics function that can safely be called from a signal han-
dler.  If 4mXtNoticeSignal24m is invoked multiple times before
the Intrinsics are able to invoke the registered callback,
the callback is only called once.  Logically, the Intrinsics
maintain ``pending'' flag for each registered callback.
This flag is initially 4mFalse24m and is set to 4mTrue24m by 4mXtNo-0m
4mticeSignal24m.  When 4mXtAppNextEvent24m or 4mXtAppProcessEvent24m (with
a mask including 4mXtIMSignal24m) is called, all registered call-
backs with ``pending'' 4mTrue24m are invoked and the flags are
reset to 4mFalse24m.

If the signal handler wants to track how many times the sig-
nal has been raised, it can keep its own private counter.
Typically the handler would not do any other work; the call-
back does the actual processing for the signal. The Intrin-
sics never block signals from being raised, so if a given
signal can be raised multiple times before the Intrinsics
can invoke the callback for that signal, the callback must
be designed to deal with this.	In another case, a signal
might be raised just after the Intrinsics sets the pending
flag to 4mFalse24m but before the callback can get control, in
which case the pending flag will still be 4mTrue24m after the
callback returns, and the Intrinsics will invoke the call-
back again, even though all of the signal raises have been
handled.  The callback must also be prepared to handle this



			     1m1640m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


case.

To remove a registered signal callback, call 4mXtRemoveSignal24m.

__
|
void XtRemoveSignal(4mid24m)
      XtSignalId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies the id returned by the corresponding
	  call to 4mXtAppAddSignal24m.
|__

The client should typically disable the source of the signal
before calling 4mXtRemoveSignal24m.  If the signal could have
been raised again before the source was disabled and the
client wants to process it, then after disabling the source
but before calling 4mXtRemoveSignal24m the client can test for
signals with 4mXtAppPending24m and process them by calling 4mXtApp-0m
4mProcessEvent24m with the mask 4mXtIMSignal24m.


1m7.2.	Constraining Events to a Cascade of Widgets0m

Modal widgets are widgets that, except for the input
directed to them, lock out user input to the application.

When a modal menu or modal dialog box is popped up using
4mXtPopup24m, user events (keyboard and pointer events) that
occur outside the modal widget should be delivered to the
modal widget or ignored.  In no case will user events be
delivered to a widget outside the modal widget.

Menus can pop up submenus, and dialog boxes can pop up fur-
ther dialog boxes to create a pop-up cascade.  In this case,
user events may be delivered to one of several modal widgets
in the cascade.

Display-related events should be delivered outside the modal
cascade so that exposure events and the like keep the appli-
cation's display up-to-date.  Any event that occurs within
the cascade is delivered as usual.  The user events deliv-
ered to the most recent spring-loaded shell in the cascade
when they occur outside the cascade are called remap events
and are 4mKeyPress24m, 4mKeyRelease24m, 4mButtonPress24m, and 4mButtonRe-0m
4mlease24m.  The user events ignored when they occur outside the
cascade are 4mMotionNotify24m and 4mEnterNotify24m.  All other events
are delivered normally.	 In particular, note that this is
one way in which widgets can receive 4mLeaveNotify24m events
without first receiving 4mEnterNotify24m events; they should be
prepared to deal with this, typically by ignoring any
unmatched 4mLeaveNotify24m events.




			     1m1650m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtPopup24m uses the 4mXtAddGrab24m and 4mXtRemoveGrab24m functions to
constrain user events to a modal cascade and subsequently to
remove a grab when the modal widget is popped down.



To constrain or redirect user input to a modal widget, use
4mXtAddGrab24m.

__
|
void XtAddGrab(4mw24m, 4mexclusive24m, 4mspring_loaded24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Boolean 4mexclusive24m;
      Boolean 4mspring_loaded24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget to add to the modal cascade.
	  Must be of class Core or any subclass thereof.

4mexclusive24m Specifies whether user events should be dispatched
	  exclusively to this widget or also to previous
	  widgets in the cascade.

4mspring_loaded0m
	  Specifies whether this widget was popped up
	  because the user pressed a pointer button.
|__

The 4mXtAddGrab24m function appends the widget to the modal cas-
cade and checks that 4mexclusive24m is 4mTrue24m if 4mspring_loaded24m is
4mTrue24m.  If this condition is not met, 4mXtAddGrab24m generates a
warning message.

The modal cascade is used by 4mXtDispatchEvent24m when it tries
to dispatch a user event.  When at least one modal widget is
in the widget cascade, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m first determines if
the event should be delivered.	It starts at the most recent
cascade entry and follows the cascade up to and including
the most recent cascade entry added with the 4mexclusive0m
parameter 4mTrue24m.

This subset of the modal cascade along with all descendants
of these widgets comprise the active subset.  User events
that occur outside the widgets in this subset are ignored or
remapped.  Modal menus with submenus generally add a submenu
widget to the cascade with 4mexclusive24m 4mFalse24m.  Modal dialog
boxes that need to restrict user input to the most deeply
nested dialog box add a subdialog widget to the cascade with
4mexclusive24m 4mTrue24m.  User events that occur within the active
subset are delivered to the appropriate widget, which is
usually a child or further descendant of the modal widget.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Regardless of where in the application they occur, remap
events are always delivered to the most recent widget in the
active subset of the cascade registered with 4mspring_loaded0m
4mTrue24m, if any such widget exists.  If the event occurred in
the active subset of the cascade but outside the spring-
loaded widget, it is delivered normally before being deliv-
ered also to the spring-loaded widget.	Regardless of where
it is dispatched, the Intrinsics do not modify the contents
of the event.


To remove the redirection of user input to a modal widget,
use 4mXtRemoveGrab24m.

__

void XtRemoveGrab(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget to remove from the modal cas-
	  cade.

The 4mXtRemoveGrab24m function removes widgets from the modal
cascade starting at the most recent widget up to and includ-
ing the specified widget.  It issues a warning if the speci-
fied widget is not on the modal cascade.


1m7.2.1.  Requesting Key and Button Grabs0m

The Intrinsics provide a set of key and button grab inter-
faces that are parallel to those provided by Xlib and that
allow the Intrinsics to modify event dispatching when neces-
sary.  X Toolkit applications and widgets that need to pas-
sively grab keys or buttons or actively grab the keyboard or
pointer should use the following Intrinsics routines rather
than the corresponding Xlib routines.


To passively grab a single key of the keyboard, use
4mXtGrabKey24m.

1m7.3.	Focusing Events on a Child0m

To redirect keyboard input to a normal descendant of a wid-

__
|
void XtSetKeyboardFocus(4msubtree24m 4mdescendant24m)
     Widget 4msubtree24m, 4mdescendant24m;


4msubtree24m   Specifies the subtree of the hierarchy for which
	  the keyboard focus is to be set.  Must be of class
	  Core or any subclass thereof.

4mdescendant0m
	  Specifies either the normal (non-pop-up) descen-
	  dant of 4msubtree24m to which keyboard events are logi-
	  cally directed, or 4mNone24m.	 It is not an error to
	  specify 4mNone24m when no input focus was previously
	  set.	Must be of class Object or any subclass
	  thereof.
|__

4mXtSetKeyboardFocus24m causes 4mXtDispatchEvent24m to remap keyboard
events occurring within the specified subtree and dispatch
them to the specified descendant widget or to an ancestor.
If the descendant's class is not a subclass of Core, the
descendant is replaced by its closest windowed ancestor.

When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can be dis-
patched to a widget in one of five ways.  Assume the server
delivered the event to the window for widget E (because of X
input focus, key or keyboard grabs, or pointer position).

  If neither E nor any of E's ancestors have redirected the
   keyboard focus, or if the event activated a grab for E as
   specified by a call to 4mXtGrabKey24m with any value of
   4mowner_events24m, or if the keyboard is actively grabbed by E
   with 4mowner_events24m 4mFalse24m via 4mXtGrabKeyboard24m or 4mXtGrabKey0m
   on a previous key press, the event is dispatched to E.

  Beginning with the ancestor of E closest to the root that
   has redirected the keyboard focus or E if no such ances-
   tor exists, if the target of that focus redirection has
   in turn redirected the keyboard focus, recursively follow
   this focus chain to find a widget F that has not redi-
   rected focus.

   -  If E is the final focus target widget F or a descen-
      dant of F, the event is dispatched to E.

   -  If E is not F, an ancestor of F, or a descendant of F,
      and the event activated a grab for E as specified by a



			     1m1730m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


      call to 4mXtGrabKey24m for E, 4mXtUngrabKeyboard24m is called.

   -  If E is an ancestor of F, and the event is a key
      press, and either

      +	 E has grabbed the key with 4mXtGrabKey24m and
	 4mowner_events24m 4mFalse24m, or

      +	 E has grabbed the key with 4mXtGrabKey24m and
	 4mowner_events24m 4mTrue24m, and the coordinates of the event
	 are outside the rectangle specified by E's geome-
	 try,
      then the event is dispatched to E.

   -  Otherwise, define A as the closest common ancestor of
      E and F:

      +	 If there is an active keyboard grab for any widget
	 via either 4mXtGrabKeyboard24m or 4mXtGrabKey24m on a previ-
	 ous key press, or if no widget between F and A
	 (noninclusive) has grabbed the key and modifier
	 combination with 4mXtGrabKey24m and any value of
	 4mowner_events24m, the event is dispatched to F.

      +	 Else, the event is dispatched to the ancestor of F
	 closest to A that has grabbed the key and modifier
	 combination with 4mXtGrabKey24m.

When there is a modal cascade, if the final destination wid-
get as identified above is in the active subset of the cas-
cade, the event is dispatched; otherwise the event is
remapped to a spring-loaded shell or discarded.	 Regardless
of where it is dispatched, the Intrinsics do not modify the
contents of the event.

When 4msubtree24m or one of its descendants acquires the X input
focus or the pointer moves into the subtree such that key-
board events would now be delivered to the subtree, a
4mFocusIn24m event is generated for the descendant if 4mFocusChange0m
events have been selected by the descendant.  Similarly,
when 4msubtree24m loses the X input focus or the keyboard focus
for one of its ancestors, a 4mFocusOut24m event is generated for
descendant if 4mFocusChange24m events have been selected by the
descendant.


A widget tree may also actively manage the X server input
focus.	To do so, a widget class specifies an accept_focus
procedure.

The accept_focus procedure pointer is of type 4mXtAcceptFocus-0m
4mProc24m.





			     1m1740m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef Boolean (*XtAcceptFocusProc)(Widget, Time*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Time *4mtime24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.

4mtime24m      Specifies the X time of the event causing the
	  accept focus.
|__

Widgets that need the input focus can call 4mXSetInputFocus0m
explicitly, pursuant to the restrictions of the 4mInter-Client0m
4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m.  To allow outside agents,
such as the parent, to cause a widget to take the input
focus, every widget exports an accept_focus procedure.	The
widget returns a value indicating whether it actually took
the focus or not, so that the parent can give the focus to
another widget.	 Widgets that need to know when they lose
the input focus must use the Xlib focus notification mecha-
nism explicitly (typically by specifying translations for
4mFocusIn24m and 4mFocusOut24m events).	 Widgets classes that never
want the input focus should set the 4maccept_focus24m field to
NULL.


To call a widget's accept_focus procedure, use 4mXtCallAccept-0m
4mFocus24m.

__
|
Boolean XtCallAcceptFocus(4mw24m, 4mtime24m)
       Widget 4mw24m;
       Time *4mtime24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mtime24m      Specifies the X time of the event that is causing
	  the focus change.
|__

The 4mXtCallAcceptFocus24m function calls the specified widget's
accept_focus procedure, passing it the specified widget and
time, and returns what the accept_focus procedure returns.
If 4maccept_focus24m is NULL, 4mXtCallAcceptFocus24m returns 4mFalse24m.


1m7.3.1.  Events for Drawables That Are Not a Widget's Window0m

Sometimes an application must handle events for drawables
that are not associated with widgets in its widget tree.



			     1m1750m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Examples include handling 4mGraphicsExpose24m and 4mNoExpose24m events
on Pixmaps, and handling 4mPropertyNotify24m events on the root
window.

To register a drawable with the Intrinsics event dispatch-
ing, use 4mXtRegisterDrawable24m.

__
|
void XtRegisterDrawable(4mdisplay24m, 4mdrawable24m, 4mwidget24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      Drawable 4mdrawable24m;
      Widget 4mwidget24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the drawable's display.

4mdrawable24m  Specifies the drawable to register.

4mwidget24m    Specifies the widget to register the drawable for.
|__

4mXtRegisterDrawable24m associates the specified drawable with
the specified widget so that future calls to 4mXtWindowToWid-0m
4mget24m with the drawable will return the widget.  The default
event dispatcher will dispatch future events that arrive for
the drawable to the widget in the same manner as events that
contain the widget's window.

If the drawable is already registered with another widget,
or if the drawable is the window of a widget in the client's
widget tree, the results of calling 4mXtRegisterDrawable24m are
undefined.


To unregister a drawable with the Intrinsics event dispatch-
ing, use 4mXtUnregisterDrawable24m.

__
|
void XtUnregisterDrawable(4mdisplay24m, 4mdrawable24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      Drawable 4mdrawable24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the drawable's display.

4mdrawable24m  Specifies the drawable to unregister.
|__

4mXtUnregisterDrawable24m removes an association created with
4mXtRegisterDrawable24m.  If the drawable is the window of a wid-
get in the client's widget tree the results of calling 4mXtUn-0m
4mregisterDrawable24m are undefined.



			     1m1760m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m7.4.	Querying Event Sources0m

The event manager provides several functions to examine and
read events (including file and timer events) that are in
the queue.  The next three functions are Intrinsics equiva-
lents of the 4mXPending24m, 4mXPeekEvent24m, and 4mXNextEvent24m Xlib
calls.


To determine if there are any events on the input queue for
a given application, use 4mXtAppPending24m.

__
|
XtInputMask XtAppPending(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application to check.
|__

The 4mXtAppPending24m function returns a nonzero value if there
are events pending from the X server, timer pending, other
input sources pending, or signal sources pending.  The value
returned is a bit mask that is the OR of 4mXtIMXEvent24m, 4mXtIM-0m
4mTimer24m, 4mXtIMAlternateInput24m, and 4mXtIMSignal24m (see 4mXtAppProces-0m
4msEvent24m).  If there are no events pending, 4mXtAppPending0m
flushes the output buffers of each Display in the applica-
tion context and returns zero.


To return the event from the head of a given application's
input queue without removing input from the queue, use
4mXtAppPeekEvent24m.

__
|
Boolean XtAppPeekEvent(4mapp_context24m, 4mevent_return24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XEvent *4mevent_return24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4mevent_return0m
	  Returns the event information to the specified
	  event structure.
|__

If there is an X event in the queue, 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m copies



			     1m1770m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


it into 4mevent_return24m and returns 4mTrue24m.  If no X input is on
the queue, 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m flushes the output buffers of each
Display in the application context and blocks until some
input is available (possibly calling some timeout callbacks
in the interim).  If the next available input is an X event,
4mXtAppPeekEvent24m fills in 4mevent_return24m and returns 4mTrue24m.  Oth-
erwise, the input is for an input source registered with
4mXtAppAddInput24m, and 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m returns 4mFalse24m.


To remove and return the event from the head of a given
application's X event queue, use 4mXtAppNextEvent24m.

__
|
void XtAppNextEvent(4mapp_context24m, 4mevent_return24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XEvent *4mevent_return24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4mevent_return0m
	  Returns the event information to the specified
	  event structure.
|__

If the X event queue is empty, 4mXtAppNextEvent24m flushes the X
output buffers of each Display in the application context
and waits for an X event while looking at the other input
sources and timeout values and calling any callback proce-
dures triggered by them.  This wait time can be used for
background processing; see Section 7.8.


1m7.5.	Dispatching Events0m

The Intrinsics provide functions that dispatch events to
widgets or other application code.  Every client interested
in X events on a widget uses 4mXtAddEventHandler24m to register
which events it is interested in and a procedure (event han-
dler) to be called when the event happens in that window.
The translation manager automatically registers event han-
dlers for widgets that use translation tables; see Chapter
10.

-----------
The sample implementations provides XtAppPeekEvent
as described.  Timeout callbacks are called while
blocking for input.  If some input for an input
source is available, 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m will return
4mTrue24m without returning an event.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Applications that need direct control of the processing of
different types of input should use 4mXtAppProcessEvent24m.

__
|
void XtAppProcessEvent(4mapp_context24m, 4mmask24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtInputMask 4mmask24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application for which to process input.

4mmask24m      Specifies what types of events to process.  The
	  mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of any combina-
	  tion of 4mXtIMXEvent24m, 4mXtIMTimer24m, 4mXtIMAlternateInput24m,
	  and 4mXtIMSignal24m.	As a convenience, 4mIntrinsic.h0m
	  defines the symbolic name 4mXtIMAll24m to be the bit-
	  wise inclusive OR of these four event types.
|__

The 4mXtAppProcessEvent24m function processes one timer, input
source, signal source, or X event.  If there is no event or
input of the appropriate type to process, then 4mXtAppProces-0m
4msEvent24m blocks until there is.  If there is more than one
type of input available to process, it is undefined which
will get processed.  Usually, this procedure is not called
by client applications; see 4mXtAppMainLoop24m.	 4mXtAppProcessEv-0m
4ment24m processes timer events by calling any appropriate timer
callbacks, input sources by calling any appropriate input
callbacks, signal source by calling any appropriate signal
callbacks, and X events by calling 4mXtDispatchEvent24m.

When an X event is received, it is passed to 4mXtDis-0m
4mpatchEvent24m, which calls the appropriate event handlers and
passes them the widget, the event, and client-specific data
registered with each procedure.	 If no handlers for that
event are registered, the event is ignored and the dis-
patcher simply returns.



To dispatch an event returned by 4mXtAppNextEvent24m, retrieved
directly from the Xlib queue, or synthetically constructed,
to any registered event filters or event handlers, call
4mXtDispatchEvent24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Boolean XtDispatchEvent(4mevent24m)
      XEvent *4mevent24m;


4mevent24m     Specifies a pointer to the event structure to be
	  dispatched to the appropriate event handlers.
|__

The 4mXtDispatchEvent24m function first calls 4mXFilterEvent24m with
the 4mevent24m and the window of the widget to which the Intrin-
sics intend to dispatch the event, or the event window if
the Intrinsics would not dispatch the event to any handlers.
If 4mXFilterEvent24m returns 4mTrue24m and the event activated a
server grab as identified by a previous call to 4mXtGrabKey24m or
4mXtGrabButton24m, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m calls 4mXtUngrabKeyboard24m or
4mXtUngrabPointer24m with the timestamp from the event and imme-
diately returns 4mTrue24m.  If 4mXFilterEvent24m returns 4mTrue24m and a
grab was not activated, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m just immediately
returns 4mTrue24m.  Otherwise, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m sends the event to
the event handler functions that have been previously regis-
tered with the dispatch routine.  4mXtDispatchEvent24m returns
4mTrue24m if 4mXFilterEvent24m returned 4mTrue24m, or if the event was dis-
patched to some handler, and 4mFalse24m if it found no handler to
which to dispatch the event.  4mXtDispatchEvent24m records the
last timestamp in any event that contains a timestamp (see
4mXtLastTimestampProcessed24m), regardless of whether it was fil-
tered or dispatched.  If a modal cascade is active with
4mspring_loaded24m 4mTrue24m, and if the event is a remap event as
defined by 4mXtAddGrab24m, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m may dispatch the event
a second time.	If it does so, 4mXtDispatchEvent24m will call
4mXFilterEvent24m again with the window of the spring-loaded wid-
get prior to the second dispatch, and if 4mXFilterEvent0m
returns 4mTrue24m, the second dispatch will not be performed.


1m7.6.	The Application Input Loop0m

To process all input from a given application in a continu-
ous loop, use the convenience procedure 4mXtAppMainLoop24m.

__
|
void XtAppMainLoop(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.
|__

The 4mXtAppMainLoop24m function first reads the next incoming X
event by calling 4mXtAppNextEvent24m and then dispatches the



			     1m1800m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


event to the appropriate registered procedure by calling
4mXtDispatchEvent24m.  This constitutes the main loop of X Tool-
kit applications.  There is nothing special about 4mXtAppMain-0m
4mLoop24m; it simply calls 4mXtAppNextEvent24m and then 4mXtDis-0m
4mpatchEvent24m in a conditional loop.	At the bottom of the
loop, it checks to see if the specified application con-
text's destroy flag is set.  If the flag is set, the loop
breaks.	 The whole loop is enclosed between a matching 4mXtAp-0m
4mpLock24m and 4mXtAppUnlock24m.

Applications can provide their own version of this loop,
which tests some global termination flag or tests that the
number of top-level widgets is larger than zero before cir-
cling back to the call to 4mXtAppNextEvent24m.


1m7.7.	Setting and Checking the Sensitivity State of a Widget0m

Many widgets have a mode in which they assume a different
appearance (for example, are grayed out or stippled), do not
respond to user events, and become dormant.

When dormant, a widget is considered to be insensitive.	 If
a widget is insensitive, the event manager does not dispatch
any events to the widget with an event type of 4mKeyPress24m,
4mKeyRelease24m, 4mButtonPress24m, 4mButtonRelease24m, 4mMotionNotify24m, 4mEnter-0m
4mNotify24m, 4mLeaveNotify24m, 4mFocusIn24m, or 4mFocusOut24m.

A widget can be insensitive because its 4msensitive24m field is
4mFalse24m or because one of its ancestors is insensitive and
thus the widget's 4mancestor_sensitive24m field also is 4mFalse24m.  A
widget can but does not need to distinguish these two cases
visually.

			    Note

     Pop-up shells will have 4mancestor_sensitive24m 4mFalse0m
     if the parent was insensitive when the shell was
     created.  Since 4mXtSetSensitive24m on the parent will
     not modify the resource of the pop-up child,
     clients are advised to include a resource specifi-
     cation of the form ``*TransientShell.ancestorSen-
     sitive: True'' in the application defaults
     resource file or to otherwise ensure that the par-
     ent is sensitive when creating pop-up shells.



To set the sensitivity state of a widget, use 4mXtSetSensi-0m
4mtive24m.







			     1m1810m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtSetSensitive(4mw24m, 4msensitive24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Boolean 4msensitive24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.

4msensitive24m Specifies whether the widget should receive key-
	  board, pointer, and focus events.
|__

The 4mXtSetSensitive24m function first calls 4mXtSetValues24m on the
current widget with an argument list specifying the XtNsen-
sitive resource and the new value.  If 4msensitive24m is 4mFalse0m
and the widget's class is a subclass of Composite, 4mXtSetSen-0m
4msitive24m recursively propagates the new value down the child
tree by calling 4mXtSetValues24m on each child to set 4mances-0m
4mtor_sensitive24m to 4mFalse24m.  If 4msensitive24m is 4mTrue24m and the wid-
get's class is a subclass of Composite and the widget's
4mancestor_sensitive24m field is 4mTrue24m, 4mXtSetSensitive24m sets the
4mancestor_sensitive24m of each child to 4mTrue24m and then recur-
sively calls 4mXtSetValues24m on each normal descendant that is
now sensitive to set 4mancestor_sensitive24m to 4mTrue24m.

4mXtSetSensitive24m calls 4mXtSetValues24m to change the 4msensitive24m and
4mancestor_sensitive24m fields of each affected widget.	 There-
fore, when one of these changes, the widget's set_values
procedure should take whatever display actions are needed
(for example, graying out or stippling the widget).

4mXtSetSensitive24m maintains the invariant that, if the parent
has either 4msensitive24m or 4mancestor_sensitive24m 4mFalse24m, then all
children have 4mancestor_sensitive24m 4mFalse24m.


To check the current sensitivity state of a widget, use
4mXtIsSensitive24m.

__
|
Boolean XtIsSensitive(4mw24m)
     Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the object.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtIsSensitive24m function returns 4mTrue24m or 4mFalse24m to indicate
whether user input events are being dispatched.	 If object's
class is a subclass of RectObj and both 4msensitive24m and 4mances-0m
4mtor_sensitive24m are 4mTrue24m, 4mXtIsSensitive24m returns 4mTrue24m;



			     1m1820m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


otherwise, it returns 4mFalse24m.


1m7.8.	Adding Background Work Procedures0m

The Intrinsics have some limited support for background pro-
cessing.  Because most applications spend most of their time
waiting for input, you can register an idle-time work proce-
dure that is called when the toolkit would otherwise block
in 4mXtAppNextEvent24m or 4mXtAppProcessEvent24m.  Work procedure
pointers are of type 4mXtWorkProc24m.

__
|
typedef Boolean (*XtWorkProc)(XtPointer);
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mclient_data0m
	  Passes the client data specified when the work
	  procedure was registered.
|__

This procedure should return 4mTrue24m when it is done to indi-
cate that it should be removed.	 If the procedure returns
4mFalse24m, it will remain registered and called again when the
application is next idle.  Work procedures should be very
judicious about how much they do.  If they run for more than
a small part of a second, interactive feel is likely to suf-
fer.


To register a work procedure for a given application, use
4mXtAppAddWorkProc24m.























			     1m1830m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
XtWorkProcId XtAppAddWorkProc(4mapp_context24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtWorkProc 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that identifies
	  the application.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called when the
	  application is idle.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the argument passed to the specified
	  procedure when it is called.
|__

The 4mXtAppAddWorkProc24m function adds the specified work proce-
dure for the application identified by 4mapp_context24m and
returns an opaque unique identifier for this work procedure.
Multiple work procedures can be registered, and the most
recently added one is always the one that is called.  How-
ever, if a work procedure adds another work procedure, the
newly added one has lower priority than the current one.


To remove a work procedure, either return 4mTrue24m from the pro-
cedure when it is called or use 4mXtRemoveWorkProc24m outside of
the procedure.

__
|
void XtRemoveWorkProc(4mid24m)
      XtWorkProcId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies which work procedure to remove.
|__

The 4mXtRemoveWorkProc24m function explicitly removes the speci-
fied background work procedure.


1m7.9.	X Event Filters0m

The event manager provides filters that can be applied to
specific X events.  The filters, which screen out events
that are redundant or are temporarily unwanted, handle
pointer motion compression, enter/leave compression, and
exposure compression.





			     1m1840m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m7.9.1.  Pointer Motion Compression0m

Widgets can have a hard time keeping up with a rapid stream
of pointer motion events.  Furthermore, they usually do not
care about every motion event.	To throw out redundant
motion events, the widget class field 4mcompress_motion24m should
be 4mTrue24m.  When a request for an event would return a motion
event, the Intrinsics check if there are any other motion
events for the same widget immediately following the current
one and, if so, skip all but the last of them.


1m7.9.2.  Enter/Leave Compression0m

To throw out pairs of enter and leave events that have no
intervening events, as can happen when the user moves the
pointer across a widget without stopping in it, the widget
class field 4mcompress_enterleave24m should be 4mTrue24m.  These enter
and leave events are not delivered to the client if they are
found together in the input queue.


1m7.9.3.  Exposure Compression0m

Many widgets prefer to process a series of exposure events
as a single expose region rather than as individual rectan-
gles.  Widgets with complex displays might use the expose
region as a clip list in a graphics context, and widgets
with simple displays might ignore the region entirely and
redisplay their whole window or might get the bounding box
from the region and redisplay only that rectangle.

In either case, these widgets do not care about getting par-
tial exposure events.  The 4mcompress_exposure24m field in the
widget class structure specifies the type and number of
exposure events that are dispatched to the widget's expose
procedure.  This field must be initialized to one of the
following values:

__
|
#define XtExposeNoCompress    ((XtEnum)False)
#define XtExposeCompressSeries((XtEnum)True)
#define XtExposeCompressMultiple<implementation-defined>
#define XtExposeCompressMaximal<implementation-defined>

|__

optionally ORed with any combination of the following flags
(all with implementation-defined values): 4mXtExposeGraphic-0m
4msExpose24m, 4mXtExposeGraphicsExposeMerged24m, 4mXtExposeNoExpose24m, and
4mXtExposeNoRegion24m.





			     1m1850m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


If the 4mcompress_exposure24m field in the widget class structure
does not specify 4mXtExposeNoCompress24m, the event manager calls
the widget's expose procedure only once for a series of
exposure events.  In this case, all 4mExpose24m or 4mGraphicsExpose0m
events are accumulated into a region.  When the final event
is received, the event manager replaces the rectangle in the
event with the bounding box for the region and calls the
widget's expose procedure, passing the modified exposure
event and (unless 4mXtExposeNoRegion24m is specified) the region.
For more information on regions, see Section 16.5 in 4mXlib24m 4m--0m
4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.)

The values have the following interpretation:


4mXtExposeNoCompress0m

     No exposure compression is performed; every selected
     event is individually dispatched to the expose proce-
     dure with a 4mregion24m argument of NULL.


4mXtExposeCompressSeries0m

     Each series of exposure events is coalesced into a sin-
     gle event, which is dispatched when an exposure event
     with count equal to zero is reached.


4mXtExposeCompressMultiple0m

     Consecutive series of exposure events are coalesced
     into a single event, which is dispatched when an expo-
     sure event with count equal to zero is reached and
     either the event queue is empty or the next event is
     not an exposure event for the same widget.


4mXtExposeCompressMaximal0m

     All expose series currently in the queue for the widget
     are coalesced into a single event without regard to
     intervening nonexposure events.  If a partial series is
     in the end of the queue, the Intrinsics will block
     until the end of the series is received.


The additional flags have the following meaning:


4mXtExposeGraphicsExpose0m

     Specifies that 4mGraphicsExpose24m events are also to be
     dispatched to the expose procedure.  4mGraphicsExpose0m



			     1m1860m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     events are compressed, if specified, in the same manner
     as 4mExpose24m events.


4mXtExposeGraphicsExposeMerged0m

     Specifies in the case of 4mXtExposeCompressMultiple24m and
     4mXtExposeCompressMaximal24m that series of 4mGraphicsExpose0m
     and 4mExpose24m events are to be compressed together, with
     the final event type determining the type of the event
     passed to the expose procedure.  If this flag is not
     set, then only series of the same event type as the
     event at the head of the queue are coalesced.  This
     flag also implies 4mXtExposeGraphicsExpose24m.


4mXtExposeNoExpose0m

     Specifies that 4mNoExpose24m events are also to be dis-
     patched to the expose procedure.  4mNoExpose24m events are
     never coalesced with other exposure events or with each
     other.


4mXtExposeNoRegion0m

     Specifies that the final region argument passed to the
     expose procedure is NULL.	The rectangle in the event
     will still contain bounding box information for the
     entire series of compressed exposure events.  This
     option saves processing time when the region is not
     needed by the widget.


1m7.10.	 Widget Exposure and Visibility0m

Every primitive widget and some composite widgets display
data on the screen by means of direct Xlib calls.  Widgets
cannot simply write to the screen and forget what they have
done.  They must keep enough state to redisplay the window
or parts of it if a portion is obscured and then reexposed.


1m7.10.1.  Redisplay of a Widget: The expose Procedure0m

The expose procedure pointer in a widget class is of type
4mXtExposeProc24m.










			     1m1870m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtExposeProc)(Widget, XEvent*, Region);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XEvent *4mevent24m;
      Region 4mregion24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget instance requiring redisplay.

4mevent24m     Specifies the exposure event giving the rectangle
	  requiring redisplay.

4mregion24m    Specifies the union of all rectangles in this
	  exposure sequence.
|__

The redisplay of a widget upon exposure is the responsibil-
ity of the expose procedure in the widget's class record.
If a widget has no display semantics, it can specify NULL
for the 4mexpose24m field.  Many composite widgets serve only as
containers for their children and have no expose procedure.

			    Note

     If the 4mexpose24m procedure is NULL, 4mXtRealizeWidget0m
     fills in a default bit gravity of 4mNorthWestGravity0m
     before it calls the widget's realize procedure.


If the widget's 4mcompress_exposure24m class field specifies
4mXtExposeNoCompress24m or 4mXtExposeNoRegion24m, or if the event type
is 4mNoExpose24m (see Section 7.9.3), 4mregion24m is NULL.  If 4mXtEx-0m
4mposeNoCompress24m is not specified and the event type is not
4mNoExpose24m, the event is the final event in the compressed
series but 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, and 4mheight24m contain the bounding box
for all the compressed events.	The region is created and
destroyed by the Intrinsics, but the widget is permitted to
modify the region contents.

A small simple widget (for example, Label) can ignore the
bounding box information in the event and redisplay the
entire window.	A more complicated widget (for example,
Text) can use the bounding box information to minimize the
amount of calculation and redisplay it does.  A very complex
widget uses the region as a clip list in a GC and ignores
the event information.	The expose procedure is not chained
and is therefore responsible for exposure of all superclass
data as well as its own.

However, it often is possible to anticipate the display
needs of several levels of subclassing.	 For example, rather
than implement separate display procedures for the widgets
Label, Pushbutton, and Toggle, you could write a single dis-
play routine in Label that uses display state fields like



			     1m1880m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     Boolean invert;
     Boolean highlight;
     Dimension highlight_width;

Label would have 4minvert24m and 4mhighlight24m always 4mFalse24m and 4mhigh-0m
4mlight_width24m zero.	Pushbutton would dynamically set 4mhigh-0m
4mlight24m and 4mhighlight_width24m, but it would leave 4minvert24m always
4mFalse24m.  Finally, Toggle would dynamically set all three.  In
this case, the expose procedures for Pushbutton and Toggle
inherit their superclass's expose procedure; see Section
1.6.10.


1m7.10.2.  Widget Visibility0m

Some widgets may use substantial computing resources to pro-
duce the data they will display.  However, this effort is
wasted if the widget is not actually visible on the screen,
that is, if the widget is obscured by another application or
is iconified.

The 4mvisible24m field in the core widget structure provides a
hint to the widget that it need not compute display data.
This field is guaranteed to be 4mTrue24m by the time an exposure
event is processed if any part of the widget is visible, but
is 4mFalse24m if the widget is fully obscured.

Widgets can use or ignore the 4mvisible24m hint.  If they ignore
it, they should have 4mvisible_interest24m in their widget class
record set 4mFalse24m.	In such cases, the 4mvisible24m field is ini-
tialized 4mTrue24m and never changes.  If 4mvisible_interest24m is
4mTrue24m, the event manager asks for 4mVisibilityNotify24m events for
the widget and sets 4mvisible24m to 4mTrue24m on 4mVisibilityUnobscured0m
or 4mVisibilityPartiallyObscured24m events and 4mFalse24m on 4mVisibili-0m
4mtyFullyObscured24m events.


1m7.11.	 X Event Handlers0m

Event handlers are procedures called when specified events
occur in a widget.  Most widgets need not use event handlers
explicitly.  Instead, they use the Intrinsics translation
manager.  Event handler procedure pointers are of the type
4mXtEventHandler24m.













			     1m1890m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtEventHandler)(Widget, XtPointer, XEvent*, Boolean*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
      XEvent *4mevent24m;
      Boolean *4mcontinue_to_dispatch24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget for which the event arrived.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies any client-specific information regis-
	  tered with the event handler.

4mevent24m     Specifies the triggering event.

4mcontinue_to_dispatch0m
	  Specifies whether the remaining event handlers
	  registered for the current event should be called.
|__

After receiving an event and before calling any event han-
dlers, the Boolean pointed to by 4mcontinue_to_dispatch24m is
initialized to 4mTrue24m.  When an event handler is called, it
may decide that further processing of the event is not
desirable and may store 4mFalse24m in this Boolean, in which case
any handlers remaining to be called for the event are
ignored.

The circumstances under which the Intrinsics may add event
handlers to a widget are currently implementation-dependent.
Clients must therefore be aware that storing 4mFalse24m into the
4mcontinue_to_dispatch24m argument can lead to portability prob-
lems.


1m7.11.1.  Event Handlers That Select Events0m

To register an event handler procedure with the dispatch
mechanism, use 4mXtAddEventHandler24m.

















			     1m1900m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtAddEventHandler(4mw24m, 4mevent_mask24m, 4mnonmaskable24m, 4mproc24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      EventMask 4mevent_mask24m;
      Boolean 4mnonmaskable24m;
      XtEventHandler 4mproc24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget for which this event handler
	  is being registered.	Must be of class Core or any
	  subclass thereof.

4mevent_mask0m
	  Specifies the event mask for which to call this
	  procedure.

4mnonmaskable0m
	  Specifies whether this procedure should be called
	  on the nonmaskable events (4mGraphicsExpose24m, 4mNoEx-0m
	  4mpose24m, 4mSelectionClear24m, 4mSelectionRequest24m, 4mSelection-0m
	  4mNotify24m, 4mClientMessage24m, and 4mMappingNotify24m).

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be called.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies additional data to be passed to the
	  event handler.
|__

The 4mXtAddEventHandler24m function registers a procedure with
the dispatch mechanism that is to be called when an event
that matches the mask occurs on the specified widget.  Each
widget has a single registered event handler list, which
will contain any procedure/client_data pair exactly once
regardless of the manner in which it is registered.  If the
procedure is already registered with the same 4mclient_data0m
value, the specified mask augments the existing mask.  If
the widget is realized, 4mXtAddEventHandler24m calls 4mXSelectIn-0m
4mput24m, if necessary.	 The order in which this procedure is
called relative to other handlers registered for the same
event is not defined.


To remove a previously registered event handler, use
4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m.

4mevent_mask0m
	  Specifies the event mask for which to unregister
	  this procedure.

4mnonmaskable0m
	  Specifies whether this procedure should be removed
	  on the nonmaskable events (4mGraphicsExpose24m, 4mNoEx-0m

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to be removed.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the registered client data.

The 4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m function unregisters an event han-
dler registered with 4mXtAddEventHandler24m or 4mXtInsertEven-0m
4mtHandler24m for the specified events.	 The request is ignored
if 4mclient_data24m does not match the value given when the han-
dler was registered.  If the widget is realized and no other
event handler requires the event, 4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m calls
4mXSelectInput24m.  If the specified procedure has not been reg-
istered or if it has been registered with a different value
of 4mclient_data24m, 4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m returns without report-
ing an error.

To stop a procedure registered with 4mXtAddEventHandler24m or
4mXtInsertEventHandler24m from receiving all selected events,
call 4mXtRemoveEventHandler24m with an 4mevent_mask24m of 4mXtAllEvents0m
and 4mnonmaskable24m 4mTrue24m.	 The procedure will continue to
receive any events that have been specified in calls to
4mXtAddRawEventHandler24m or 4mXtInsertRawEventHandler24m.


To register an event handler procedure that receives events
before or after all previously registered event handlers,
use 4mXtInsertEventHandler24m.

4mXtInsertEventHandler24m is identical to 4mXtAddEventHandler24m with
the additional 4mposition24m argument.	If 4mposition24m is 4mXtList-0m
4mHead24m, the event handler is registered so that it is called
before any event handlers that were previously registered
for the same widget.  If 4mposition24m is 4mXtListTail24m, the event
handler is registered to be called after any previously reg-
istered event handlers.	 If the procedure is already regis-
tered with the same 4mclient_data24m value, the specified mask
augments the existing mask and the procedure is repositioned
in the list.

The 4mXtAddRawEventHandler24m function is similar to 4mXtAddEven-0m
4mtHandler24m except that it does not affect the widget's event
mask and never causes an 4mXSelectInput24m for its events.  Note
that the widget might already have those mask bits set
because of other nonraw event handlers registered on it.  If

The 4mXtRemoveRawEventHandler24m function unregisters an event
handler registered with 4mXtAddRawEventHandler24m or 4mXtInsertRaw-0m
4mEventHandler24m for the specified events without changing the
window event mask.  The request is ignored if 4mclient_data0m
does not match the value given when the handler was regis-
tered.	If the specified procedure has not been registered
or if it has been registered with a different value of
4mclient_data24m, 4mXtRemoveRawEventHandler24m returns without report-
ing an error.

To stop a procedure registered with 4mXtAddRawEventHandler24m or

4mXtInsertEventTypeHandler24m registers a procedure with the dis-
patch mechanism that is to be called when an event that
matches the specified 4mevent_type24m is dispatched to the speci-
fied 4mwidget24m.

If 4mevent_type24m specifies one of the core X protocol events,
then 4mselect_data24m must be a pointer to a value of type 4mEvent-0m
4mMask24m, indicating the event mask to be used to select for the
desired event.	This event mask is included in the value
returned by 4mXtBuildEventMask24m.  If the widget is realized,
4mXtInsertEventTypeHandler24m calls 4mXSelectInput24m if necessary.
Specifying NULL for 4mselect_data24m is equivalent to specifying
a pointer to an event mask containing 0.  This is similar to
the 4mXtInsertRawEventHandler24m function.

If 4mevent_type24m specifies an extension event type, then the
semantics of the data pointed to by 4mselect_data24m are defined
by the extension selector registered for the specified event
type.

In either case the Intrinsics are not required to copy the
data pointed to by 4mselect_data24m, so the caller must ensure



			     1m1980m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


that it remains valid as long as the event handler remains
registered with this value of 4mselect_data24m.

The 4mposition24m argument allows the client to control the order
of invocation of event handlers registered for the same
event type.  If the client does not care about the order, it
should normally specify 4mXtListTail24m, which registers this
event handler after any previously registered handlers for
this event type.

Each widget has a single registered event handler list,
which will contain any procedure/client_data pair exactly
once if it is registered with 4mXtInsertEventTypeHandler24m,
regardless of the manner in which it is registered and
regardless of the value(s) of 4mselect_data24m.	 If the procedure
is already registered with the same 4mclient_data24m value, the
specified mask augments the existing mask and the procedure
is repositioned in the list.

4mTypeHandler24m, use 4mXtRemoveEventTypeHandler24m.

	  registered.

4mselect_data0m
	  Specifies data used to deselect events of the
	  specified type from the server, or NULL.

4mproc24m      Specifies the event handler to be removed.

4mclient_data0m

specified event type.  The request is ignored if 4mclient_data0m
does not match the value given when the handler was regis-
tered.

If 4mevent_type24m specifies one of the core X protocol events,
4mselect_data24m must be a pointer to a value of type 4mEvent-0m
4mMask,24mindicating mask to be used to deselect for the appro-
priate event.  If the widget is realized, 4mXtRemoveEventType-0m
4mHandler24m calls 4mXSelectInput24m if necessary.  Specifying NULL
for 4mselect_data24m is equivalent to specifying a pointer to an
event mask containing 0.  This is similar to the 4mXtRemoveR-0m
4mawEventHandler24m function.

If 4mevent_type24m specifies an extension event type, then the
semantics of the data pointed to by 4mselect_data24m are defined
by the extension selector registered for the specified event
type.


To register a procedure to select extension events for a
widget, use 4mXtRegisterExtensionSelector24m.

4mmin_event_type0m

4mmax_event_type24m Specifies the range of event types for the
	       extension.

4mproc24m	    Specifies the extension selector procedure.

4mclient_data24m    Specifies additional data to be passed to the
	       extension selector.

The 4mXtRegisterExtensionSelector24m function registers a proce-
dure to arrange for the delivery of extension events to wid-
gets.

If 4mmin_event_type24m and 4mmax_event_type24m match the parameters to
a previous call to 4mXtRegisterExtensionSelector24m for the same
4mdisplay24m, then 4mproc24m and 4mclient_data24m replace the previously



			     1m2000m

registered values.  If the range specified by 4mmin_event_type0m
and 4mmax_event_type24m overlaps the range of the parameters to a
previous call for the same display in any other way, an
error results.

When a widget is realized, after the 4mcore.realize24m method is
called, the Intrinsics check to see if any event handler
specifies an event type within the range of a registered
extension selector.  If so, the Intrinsics call each such
selector.  If an event type handler is added or removed, the
Intrinsics check to see if the event type falls within the
range of a registered extension selector, and if it does,
calls the selector.  In either case the Intrinsics pass a
list of all the widget's event types that are within the
selector's range.  The corresponding select data are also
passed.	 The selector is responsible for enabling the deliv-
ery of extension events required by the widget.

4mevent_type0m
	  Specifies the event type for which the dispatcher
	  should be invoked.

4mproc24m      Specifies the event dispatcher procedure.
|__

The 4mXtSetEventDispatcher24m function registers the event dis-
patcher procedure specified by 4mproc24m for events with the type
4mevent_type24m.  The previously registered dispatcher (or the
default dispatcher if there was no previously registered
dispatcher) is returned.  If 4mproc24m is NULL, the default pro-
cedure is restored for the specified type.

In the future, when 4mXtDispatchEvent24m is called with an event
type of 4mevent_type24m, the specified 4mproc24m (or the default dis-
patcher) is invoked to determine a widget to which to dis-
patch the event.

The default dispatcher handles the Intrinsics modal cascade
and keyboard focus mechanisms, handles the semantics of 4mcom-0m
4mpress_enterleave24m and 4mcompress_motion24m, and discards all
extension events.


An event dispatcher procedure pointer is of type 4mXtEventDis-0m
4mpatchProc24m.

The event dispatcher procedure should determine whether this
event is of a type that should be dispatched to a widget.




			     1m2020m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


If the event should be dispatched to a widget, the event
dispatcher procedure should determine the appropriate widget
to receive the event, call 4mXFilterEvent24m with the window of
this widget, or 4mNone24m if the event is to be discarded, and if
4mXFilterEvent24m returns 4mFalse24m, dispatch the event to the widget
using 4mXtDispatchEventToWidget24m.  The procedure should return
4mTrue24m if either 4mXFilterEvent24m or 4mXtDispatchEventToWidget0m
returned 4mTrue24m and 4mFalse24m otherwise.

If the event should not be dispatched to a widget, the event
dispatcher procedure should attempt to dispatch the event
elsewhere as appropriate and return 4mTrue24m if it successfully
dispatched the event and 4mFalse24m otherwise.


Some dispatchers for extension events may wish to forward
events according to the Intrinsics' keyboard focus mecha-
nism.  To determine which widget is the end result of key-
board event forwarding, use 4mXtGetKeyboardFocusWidget24m.

The 4mXtDispatchEventToWidget24m function scans the list of reg-
istered event handlers for the specified widget and calls
each handler that has been registered for the specified

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


event type, subject to the 4mcontinue_to_dispatch24m value
returned by each handler.  The Intrinsics behave as if event
handlers were registered at the head of the list for 4mExpose24m,
4mNoExpose24m, 4mGraphicsExpose24m, and 4mVisibilityNotify24m events to
invoke the widget's expose procedure according to the expo-
sure compression rules and to update the widget's 4mvisible0m
field if 4mvisible_interest24m is 4mTrue24m.  These internal event
handlers never set 4mcontinue_to_dispatch24m to 4mFalse24m.

4mXtDispatchEventToWidget24m returns 4mTrue24m if any event handler
was called and 4mFalse24m otherwise.


1m7.12.	 Using the Intrinsics in a Multi-Threaded Environment0m

The Intrinsics may be used in environments that offer multi-
ple threads of execution within the context of a single
process.  A multi-threaded application using the Intrinsics
must explicitly initialize the toolkit for mutually exclu-
sive access by calling 4mXtToolkitThreadInitialize24m.


1m7.12.1.  Initializing a Multi-Threaded Intrinsics Applica-0m
1mtion0m

To test and initialize Intrinsics support for mutually
exclusive thread access, call 4mXtToolkitThreadInitialize24m.

__
|
Boolean XtToolkitThreadInitialize()

|__

4mXtToolkitThreadInitialize24m returns 1mTrue 22mif the Intrinsics
support mutually exclusive thread access, otherwise it
returns 1mFalse22m. 1mXtToolkitThreadInitialize 22mmust be called
before 4mXtCreateApplicationContext24m, 4mXtAppInitialize24m, 4mXtOpe-0m
4mnApplication24m, or 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m is called. 1mXtToolkit-0m
1mThreadInitialize 22mmay be called more than once; however, the
application writer must ensure that it is not called simul-
taneously by two or more threads.


1m7.12.2.  Locking X Toolkit Data Structures0m

The Intrinsics employs two levels of locking: application
context and process.  Locking an application context ensures
mutually exclusive access by a thread to the state associ-
ated with the application context, including all displays
and widgets associated with it.	 Locking a process ensures
mutually exclusive access by a thread to Intrinsics process
global data.




			     1m2040m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


A client may acquire a lock multiple times and the effect is
cumulative.  The client must ensure that the lock is
released an equal number of times in order for the lock to
be acquired by another thread.

Most application writers will have little need to use lock-
ing as the Intrinsics performs the necessary locking inter-
nally.	Resource converters are an exception.  They require
the application context or process to be locked before the
application can safely call them directly, for example:


	  ...
	  XtAppLock(app_context);
	  XtCvtStringToPixel(dpy, args, num_args, fromVal, toVal, closure_ret);
	  XtAppUnlock(app_context);
	  ...


When the application relies upon 4mXtConvertAndStore24m or a con-
verter to provide the storage for the results of a conver-
sion, the application should acquire the process lock before
calling out and hold the lock until the results have been
copied.

Application writers who write their own utility functions,
such as one which retrieves the being_destroyed field from a
widget instance, must lock the application context before
accessing widget internal data.	 For example:


     #include <X11/CoreP.h>
     Boolean BeingDestroyed (widget)
	  Widget widget;
     {
	  Boolean ret;
	  XtAppLock(XtWidgetToApplicationContext(widget));
	  ret = widget->core.being_destroyed;
	  XtAppUnlock(XtWidgetToApplicationContext(widget));
	  return ret;
     }

A client that wishes to atomically call two or more Intrin-
sics functions must lock the application context.  For exam-
ple:












			     1m2050m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


	  ...
	  XtAppLock(XtWidgetToApplicationContext(widget));
	  XtUnmanageChild (widget1);
	  XtManageChild (widget2);
	  XtAppUnlock(XtWidgetToApplicationContext(widget));
	  ...



1m7.12.2.1.  Locking the Application Context0m

To ensure mutual exclusion of application context, display,
or widget internal state, use 4mXtAppLock.0m

__
|
void XtAppLock(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context to lock.
|__

1mXtAppLock 22mblocks until it is able to acquire the lock.
Locking the application context also ensures that only the
thread holding the lock makes Xlib calls from within Xt.  An
application that makes its own direct Xlib calls must either
lock the application context around every call or enable
thread locking in Xlib.

To unlock a locked application context, use 4mXtAppUnlock.0m

__
|
void XtAppUnlock(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context that was previ-
	  ously locked.
|__



1m7.12.2.2.  Locking the Process0m

To ensure mutual exclusion of X Toolkit process global data,
a widget writer must use 4mXtProcessLock.0m







			     1m2060m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtProcessLock()

|__

1mXtProcessLock 22mblocks until it is able to acquire the lock.
Widget writers may use XtProcessLock to guarantee mutually
exclusive access to widget static data.

To unlock a locked process, use 4mXtProcessUnlock24m.

__
|
void XtProcessUnlock()

|__

To lock both an application context and the process at the
same time, call 4mXtAppLock24m first and then 4mXtProcessLock24m.  To
release both locks, call 4mXtProcessUnlock24m first and then
4mXtAppUnlock24m.  The order is important to avoid deadlock.


1m7.12.3.  Event Management in a Multi-Threaded Environment0m

In a nonthreaded environment an application writer could
reasonably assume that it is safe to exit the application
from a quit callback.  This assumption may no longer hold
true in a multi-threaded environment; therefore it is desir-
able to provide a mechanism to terminate an event-processing
loop without necessarily terminating its thread.

To indicate that the event loop should terminate after the
current event dispatch has completed, use 4mXtAppSetExitFlag24m.

__
|
void XtAppSetExitFlag(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.
|__

4mXtAppMainLoop24m tests the value of the flag and will return if
the flag is 1mTrue22m.

Application writers who implement their own main loop may
test the value of the exit flag with 4mXtAppGetExitFlag24m.







			     1m2070m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Boolean XtAppGetExitFlag(4mapp_context24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.
|__

4mXtAppGetExitFlag24m will normally return 1mFalse22m, indicating that
event processing may continue.	When 4mXtAppGetExitFlag0m
returns 1mTrue22m, the loop must terminate and return to the
caller, which might then destroy the application context.

Application writers should be aware that, if a thread is
blocked in 4mXtAppNextEvent24m, 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m, or 4mXtAppProces-0m
4msEvent24m and another thread in the same application context
opens a new display, adds an alternate input, or a timeout,
any new source(s) will not normally be "noticed" by the
blocked thread.	 Any new sources are "noticed" the next time
one of these functions is called.

The Intrinsics manage access to events on a last-in, first-
out basis.  If multiple threads in the same application con-
text block in 4mXtAppNextEvent24m, 4mXtAppPeekEvent24m, or 4mXtAppPro-0m
4mcessEvent24m, the last thread to call one of these functions is
the first thread to return.

			 1mCallbacks0m



Applications and other widgets often need to register a pro-
cedure with a widget that gets called under certain prespec-
ified conditions.  For example, when a widget is destroyed,
every procedure on the widget's 4mdestroy_callbacks24m list is
called to notify clients of the widget's impending doom.

Every widget has an XtNdestroyCallbacks callback list
resource.  Widgets can define additional callback lists as
they see fit.  For example, the Pushbutton widget has a
callback list to notify clients when the button has been
activated.

Except where otherwise noted, it is the intent that all
Intrinsics functions may be called at any time, including
from within callback procedures, action routines, and event
handlers.


1m8.1.	Using Callback Procedure and Callback List Definitions0m

Callback procedure pointers for use in callback lists are of
type 4mXtCallbackProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtCallbackProc)(Widget, XtPointer, XtPointer);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;
      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget owning the list in which the
	  callback is registered.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies additional data supplied by the client
	  when the procedure was registered.

4mcall_data24m Specifies any callback-specific data the widget
	  wants to pass to the client.	For example,  when
	  Scrollbar executes its XtNthumbChanged callback
	  list, it passes the new position of the thumb.
|__

The 4mclient_data24m argument provides a way for the client reg-
istering the callback procedure also to register client-



			     1m2090m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


specific data, for example, a pointer to additional informa-
tion about the widget, a reason for invoking the callback,
and so on.  The 4mclient_data24m value may be NULL if all neces-
sary information is in the widget.  The 4mcall_data24m argument
is a convenience to avoid having simple cases where the
client could otherwise always call 4mXtGetValues24m or a widget-
specific function to retrieve data from the widget.  Widgets
should generally avoid putting complex state information in
4mcall_data24m.	 The client can use the more general data
retrieval methods, if necessary.

Whenever a client wants to pass a callback list as an argu-
ment in an 4mXtCreateWidget24m, 4mXtSetValues24m, or 4mXtGetValues24m call,
it should specify the address of a NULL-terminated array of
type 4mXtCallbackList24m.

__
|
typedef struct {
     XtCallbackProc callback;
     XtPointer closure;
} XtCallbackRec, *XtCallbackList;

|__

For example, the callback list for procedures A and B with
client data clientDataA and clientDataB, respectively, is


static XtCallbackRec callbacks[] = {
     {A, (XtPointer) clientDataA},
     {B, (XtPointer) clientDataB},
     {(XtCallbackProc) NULL, (XtPointer) NULL}
};


Although callback lists are passed by address in arglists
and varargs lists, the Intrinsics recognize callback lists
through the widget resource list and will copy the contents
when necessary.	 Widget initialize and set_values procedures
should not allocate memory for the callback list contents.
The Intrinsics automatically do this, potentially using a
different structure for their internal representation.


1m8.2.	Identifying Callback Lists0m

Whenever a widget contains a callback list for use by
clients, it also exports in its public .h file the resource
name of the callback list.  Applications and client widgets
never access callback list fields directly.  Instead, they
always identify the desired callback list by using the
exported resource name.	 All the callback manipulation func-
tions described in this chapter except 4mXtCallCallbackList0m



			     1m2100m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


check to see that the requested callback list is indeed
implemented by the widget.

For the Intrinsics to find and correctly handle callback
lists, they must be declared with a resource type of 4mXtR-0m
4mCallback24m.	The internal representation of a callback list is
implementation-dependent; widgets may make no assumptions
about the value stored in this resource if it is non-NULL.
Except to compare the value to NULL (which is equivalent to
4mXtCallbackStatus24m 4mXtCallbackHasNone24m), access to callback list
resources must be made through other Intrinsics procedures.


1m8.3.	Adding Callback Procedures0m

To add a callback procedure to a widget's callback list, use
4mXtAddCallback24m.

__
|
void XtAddCallback(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name,24m 4mcallback24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtCallbackProc 4mcallback24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list to which the procedure
	  is to be appended.

4mcallback24m  Specifies the callback procedure.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies additional data to be passed to the
	  specified procedure when it is invoked, or NULL.
|__

A callback will be invoked as many times as it occurs in the
callback list.


To add a list of callback procedures to a given widget's
callback list, use 4mXtAddCallbacks24m.










			     1m2110m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtAddCallbacks(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name,24m 4mcallbacks24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtCallbackList 4mcallbacks24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list to which the proce-
	  dures are to be appended.

4mcallbacks24m Specifies the null-terminated list of callback
	  procedures and corresponding client data.
|__


1m8.4.	Removing Callback Procedures0m

To delete a callback procedure from a widget's callback
list, use 4mXtRemoveCallback24m.

__
|
void XtRemoveCallback(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name24m, 4mcallback24m, 4mclient_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtCallbackProc 4mcallback24m;
      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list from which the proce-
	  dure is to be deleted.

4mcallback24m  Specifies the callback procedure.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the client data to match with the regis-
	  tered callback entry.
|__

The 4mXtRemoveCallback24m function removes a callback only if
both the procedure and the client data match.


To delete a list of callback procedures from a given wid-
get's callback list, use 4mXtRemoveCallbacks24m.




			     1m2120m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtRemoveCallbacks(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name24m, 4mcallbacks24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtCallbackList 4mcallbacks24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list from which the proce-
	  dures are to be deleted.

4mcallbacks24m Specifies the null-terminated list of callback
	  procedures and corresponding client data.
|__

To delete all callback procedures from a given widget's
callback list and free all storage associated with the call-
back list, use 4mXtRemoveAllCallbacks24m.

__
|
void XtRemoveAllCallbacks(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list to be cleared.
|__


1m8.5.	Executing Callback Procedures0m

To execute the procedures in a given widget's callback list,
specifying the callback list by resource name, use 4mXtCall-0m
4mCallbacks24m.















			     1m2130m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtCallCallbacks(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name24m, 4mcall_data24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;
      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list to be executed.

4mcall_data24m Specifies a callback-list-specific data value to
	  pass to each of the callback procedure in the
	  list, or NULL.
|__


4mXtCallCallbacks24m calls each of the callback procedures in the
list named by 4mcallback_name24m in the specified widget, passing
the client data registered with the procedure and 4mcall-data24m.


To execute the procedures in a callback list, specifying the
callback list by address, use 4mXtCallCallbackList24m.

__
|
void XtCallCallbackList(4mwidget24m, 4mcallbacks24m, 4mcall_data24m)
      Widget 4mwidget24m;
      XtCallbackList 4mcallbacks24m;
      XtPointer 4mcall_data24m;


4mwidget24m    Specifies the widget instance that contains the
	  callback list.  Must be of class Object or any
	  subclass thereof.

4mcallbacks24m Specifies the callback list to be executed.

4mcall_data24m Specifies a callback-list-specific data value to
	  pass to each of the callback procedures in the
	  list, or NULL.
|__

The 4mcallbacks24m parameter must specify the contents of a wid-
get or object resource declared with representation type
4mXtRCallback24m.  If 4mcallbacks24m is NULL, 4mXtCallCallbackList0m
returns immediately; otherwise it calls each of the callback
procedures in the list, passing the client data and
4mcall_data24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m8.6.	Checking the Status of a Callback List0m

To find out the status of a given widget's callback list,
use 4mXtHasCallbacks24m.


__
|
typedef enum {XtCallbackNoList, XtCallbackHasNone, XtCallbackHasSome} XtCallbackStatus;

XtCallbackStatus XtHasCallbacks(4mw24m, 4mcallback_name24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mcallback_name24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mcallback_name0m
	  Specifies the callback list to be checked.
|__

The 4mXtHasCallbacks24m function first checks to see if the wid-
get has a callback list identified by 4mcallback_name24m.  If the
callback list does not exist, 4mXtHasCallbacks24m returns 4mXtCall-0m
4mbackNoList24m.  If the callback list exists but is empty, it
returns 4mXtCallbackHasNone24m.	 If the callback list exists and
has at least one callback registered, it returns 4mXtCallback-0m
4mHasSome24m.

		    1mResource Management0m



A resource is a field in the widget record with a corre-
sponding resource entry in the 4mresources24m list of the widget
or any of its superclasses.  This means that the field is
settable by 4mXtCreateWidget24m (by naming the field in the argu-
ment list), by an entry in a resource file (by using either
the name or class), and by 4mXtSetValues24m.  In addition, it is
readable by 4mXtGetValues24m.  Not all fields in a widget record
are resources.	Some are for bookkeeping use by the generic
routines (like 4mmanaged24m and 4mbeing_destroyed24m).	Others can be
for local bookkeeping, and still others are derived from
resources (many graphics contexts and pixmaps).

Widgets typically need to obtain a large set of resources at
widget creation time.  Some of the resources come from the
argument list supplied in the call to 4mXtCreateWidget24m, some
from the resource database, and some from the internal
defaults specified by the widget.  Resources are obtained
first from the argument list, then from the resource data-
base for all resources not specified in the argument list,
and last, from the internal default, if needed.


1m9.1.	Resource Lists0m

A resource entry specifies a field in the widget, the tex-
tual name and class of the field that argument lists and
external resource files use to refer to the field, and a
default value that the field should get if no value is spec-
ified.	The declaration for the 4mXtResource24m structure is

__
|
typedef struct {
     String resource_name;
     String resource_class;
     String resource_type;
     Cardinal resource_size;
     Cardinal resource_offset;
     String default_type;
     XtPointer default_addr;
} XtResource, *XtResourceList;
|__







			     1m2160m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


When the resource list is specified as the 4mCoreClassPart24m,
4mObjectClassPart24m, 4mRectObjClassPart24m, or 4mConstraintClassPart0m
4mresources24m field, the strings pointed to by 4mresource_name24m,
4mresource_class24m, 4mresource_type24m, and 4mdefault_type24m must be per-
manently allocated prior to or during the execution of the
class initialization procedure and must not be subsequently
deallocated.


The 4mresource_name24m field contains the name used by clients to
access the field in the widget.	 By convention, it starts
with a lowercase letter and is spelled exactly like the
field name, except all underscores (_) are deleted and the
next letter is replaced by its uppercase counterpart.  For
example, the resource name for background_pixel becomes
backgroundPixel.  Resource names beginning with the two-
character sequence ``xt'', and resource classes beginning
with the two-character sequence ``Xt'' are reserved to the
Intrinsics for future standard and implementation-dependent
uses.  Widget header files typically contain a symbolic name
for each resource name.	 All resource names, classes, and
types used by the Intrinsics are named in
<4mX11/StringDefs.h24m>.  The Intrinsics's symbolic resource
names begin with ``XtN'' and are followed by the string name
(for example, XtNbackgroundPixel for backgroundPixel).


The 4mresource_class24m field contains the class string used in
resource specification files to identify the field.  A
resource class provides two functions:

    It isolates an application from different representa-
     tions that widgets can use for a similar resource.

    It lets you specify values for several actual resources
     with a single name.  A resource class should be chosen
     to span a group of closely related fields.

For example, a widget can have several pixel resources:
background, foreground, border, block cursor, pointer cur-
sor, and so on.	 Typically, the background defaults to white
and everything else to black.  The resource class for each
of these resources in the resource list should be chosen so
that it takes the minimal number of entries in the resource
database to make the background ivory and everything else
darkblue.

In this case, the background pixel should have a resource
class of ``Background'' and all the other pixel entries a
resource class of ``Foreground''.  Then, the resource file
needs only two lines to change all pixels to ivory or dark-
blue:





			     1m2170m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


*Background:   ivory
*Foreground:   darkblue


Similarly, a widget may have several font resources (such as
normal and bold), but all fonts should have the class Font.
Thus, changing all fonts simply requires only a single line
in the default resource file:


*Font:			      6x13


By convention, resource classes are always spelled starting
with a capital letter to distinguish them from resource
names.	Their symbolic names are preceded with ``XtC'' (for
example, XtCBackground).

The 4mresource_type24m field gives the physical representation
type of the resource and also encodes information about the
specific usage of the field.  By convention, it starts with
an uppercase letter and is spelled identically to the type
name of the field.  The resource type is used when resources
are fetched to convert from the resource database format
(usually 4mString24m) or the format of the resource default value
(almost anything, but often 4mString24m) to the desired physical
representation (see Section 9.6).  The Intrinsics define the
following resource types:

------------------------------------------------------
Resource Type		    Structure or Field Type

<4mX11/StringDefs.h24m> also defines the following resource types
as a convenience for widgets, although they do not have any
corresponding data type assigned: 4mXtREditMode24m, 4mXtRJustify24m,
and 4mXtROrientation24m.

The 4mresource_size24m field is the size of the physical repre-
sentation in bytes; you should specify it as 4msizeof24m(4mtype24m) so
that the compiler fills in the value.  The 4mresource_offset0m
field is the offset in bytes of the field within the widget.
You should use the 4mXtOffsetOf24m macro to retrieve this value.
The 4mdefault_type24m field is the representation type of the
default resource value.	 If 4mdefault_type24m is different from
4mresource_type24m and the default value is needed, the resource
manager invokes a conversion procedure from 4mdefault_type24m to
4mresource_type24m.  Whenever possible, the default type should
be identical to the resource type in order to minimize wid-
get creation time.  However, there are sometimes no values
of the type that the program can easily specify.  In this
case, it should be a value for which the converter is guar-
anteed to work (for example, 4mXtDefaultForeground24m for a pixel
resource).  The 4mdefault_addr24m field specifies the address of



			     1m2190m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


the default resource value.  As a special case, if
4mdefault_type24m is 4mXtRString24m, then the value in the
4mdefault_addr24m field is the pointer to the string rather than
a pointer to the pointer.  The default is used if a resource
is not specified in the argument list or in the resource
database or if the conversion from the representation type
stored in the resource database fails, which can happen for
various reasons (for example, a misspelled entry in a
resource file).

Two special representation types (XtRImmediate and XtRCall-
Proc) are usable only as default resource types.  XtRImmedi-
ate indicates that the value in the 4mdefault_addr24m field is
the actual value of the resource rather than the address of
the value.  The value must be in the correct representation
type for the resource, coerced to an 4mXtPointer24m.  No conver-
sion is possible, since there is no source representation
type.  XtRCallProc indicates that the value in the
4mdefault_addr24m field is a procedure pointer.	 This procedure
is automatically invoked with the widget, 4mresource_offset24m,
and a pointer to an 4mXrmValue24m in which to store the result.
XtRCallProc procedure pointers are of type 4mXtResourceDe-0m
4mfaultProc24m.

typedef void (*XtResourceDefaultProc)(Widget, int, XrmValue*);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      int 4moffset24m;
      XrmValue *4mvalue24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget whose resource value is to be
	  obtained.

4moffset24m    Specifies the offset of the field in the widget
	  record.

4mvalue24m     Specifies the resource value descriptor to return.
|__

The 4mXtResourceDefaultProc24m procedure should fill in the
4mvalue->addr24m field with a pointer to the resource value in
its correct representation type.


To get the resource list structure for a particular class,
use 4mXtGetResourceList24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

void XtGetResourceList(4mclass24m, 4mresources_return24m, 4mnum_resources_return24m);
      WidgetClass 4mclass24m;
      XtResourceList *4mresources_return24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_resources_return24m;


4mclass24m	    Specifies the object class to be queried.  It
	       must be 4mobjectClass24m or any subclass thereof.

4mresources_return0m
	       Returns the resource list.

4mnum_resources_return0m
	       Returns the number of entries in the resource
	       list.
|__

If 4mXtGetResourceList24m is called before the class is initial-
ized, it returns the resource list as specified in the class
record.	 If it is called after the class has been initial-
ized, 4mXtGetResourceList24m returns a merged resource list that
includes the resources for all superclasses.  The list
returned by 4mXtGetResourceList24m should be freed using 4mXtFree0m
when it is no longer needed.


To get the constraint resource list structure for a particu-
lar widget class, use 4mXtGetConstraintResourceList24m.

__
|
void XtGetConstraintResourceList(4mclass24m, 4mresources_return24m, 4mnum_resources_return24m)
      WidgetClass 4mclass24m;
      XtResourceList *4mresources_return24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_resources_return24m;


4mclass24m	    Specifies the object class to be queried.  It
	       must be 4mobjectClass24m or any subclass thereof.

4mresources_return0m
	       Returns the constraint resource list.

4mnum_resources_return0m
	       Returns the number of entries in the con-
	       straint resource list.
|__

If 4mXtGetConstraintResourceList24m is called before the widget
class is initialized, the resource list as specified in the
widget class Constraint part is returned.  If 4mXtGetCon-0m
4mstraintResourceList24m is called after the widget class has
been initialized, the merged resource list for the class and



			     1m2210m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


all Constraint superclasses is returned.  If the specified
class is not a subclass of 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m,
*4mresources_return24m is set to NULL and *4mnum_resources_return0m
is set to zero.	 The list returned by 4mXtGetConstraintRe-0m
4msourceList24m should be freed using 4mXtFree24m when it is no longer
needed.


The routines 4mXtSetValues24m and 4mXtGetValues24m also use the
resource list to set and get widget state; see Sections
9.7.1 and 9.7.2.

Here is an abbreviated version of a possible resource list
for a Label widget:


     /* Resources specific to Label */
     static XtResource resources[] = {
     {XtNforeground, XtCForeground, XtRPixel, sizeof(Pixel),
	XtOffsetOf(LabelRec, label.foreground), XtRString, XtDefaultForeground},
     {XtNfont, XtCFont, XtRFontStruct, sizeof(XFontStruct*),
	XtOffsetOf(LabelRec, label.font), XtRString, XtDefaultFont},
     {XtNlabel, XtCLabel, XtRString, sizeof(String),
	XtOffsetOf(LabelRec, label.label), XtRString, NULL},
	  .
	  .
	  .
     }


The complete resource name for a field of a widget instance
is the concatenation of the application shell name (from
4mXtAppCreateShell24m), the instance names of all the widget's
parents up to the top of the widget tree, the instance name
of the widget itself, and the resource name of the specified
field of the widget.  Similarly, the full resource class of
a field of a widget instance is the concatenation of the
application class (from 4mXtAppCreateShell24m), the widget class
names of all the widget's parents up to the top of the wid-
get tree, the widget class name of the widget itself, and
the resource class of the specified field of the widget.


1m9.2.	Byte Offset Calculations0m

To determine the byte offset of a field within a structure
type, use 4mXtOffsetOf24m.










			     1m2220m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Cardinal XtOffsetOf(4mstructure_type24m, 4mfield_name24m)
      4mType24m 4mstructure_type24m;
      4mField24m 4mfield_name24m;


4mstructure_type0m
	  Specifies a type that is declared as a structure.

4mfield_name0m
	  Specifies the name of a member within the struc-
	  ture.
|__

The 4mXtOffsetOf24m macro expands to a constant expression that
gives the offset in bytes to the specified structure member
from the beginning of the structure.  It is normally used to
statically initialize resource lists and is more portable
than 4mXtOffset24m, which serves the same function.


To determine the byte offset of a field within a structure
pointer type, use 4mXtOffset24m.

__
|
Cardinal XtOffset(4mpointer_type24m, 4mfield_name24m)
      4mType24m 4mpointer_type24m;
      4mField24m 4mfield_name24m;


4mpointer_type0m
	  Specifies a type that is declared as a pointer to
	  a structure.

4mfield_name0m
	  Specifies the name of a member within the struc-
	  ture.
|__

The 4mXtOffset24m macro expands to a constant expression that
gives the offset in bytes to the specified structure member
from the beginning of the structure.  It may be used to
statically initialize resource lists.  4mXtOffset24m is less por-
table than 4mXtOffsetOf24m.


1m9.3.	Superclass-to-Subclass Chaining of Resource Lists0m

The 4mXtCreateWidget24m function gets resources as a superclass-
to-subclass chained operation.	That is, the resources spec-
ified in the 4mobjectClass24m resource list are fetched, then
those in 4mrectObjClass24m, and so on down to the resources spec-
ified for this widget's class. Within a class, resources are



			     1m2230m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


fetched in the order they are declared.

In general, if a widget resource field is declared in a
superclass, that field is included in the superclass's
resource list and need not be included in the subclass's
resource list.	For example, the Core class contains a
resource entry for 4mbackground_pixel24m.  Consequently, the
implementation of Label need not also have a resource entry
for 4mbackground_pixel24m.  However, a subclass, by specifying a
resource entry for that field in its own resource list, can
override the resource entry for any field declared in a
superclass.  This is most often done to override the
defaults provided in the superclass with new ones.  At class
initialization time, resource lists for that class are
scanned from the superclass down to the class to look for
resources with the same offset.	 A matching resource in a
subclass will be reordered to override the superclass entry.
If reordering is necessary, a copy of the superclass
resource list is made to avoid affecting other subclasses of
the superclass.

Also at class initialization time, the Intrinsics produce an
internal representation of the resource list to optimize
access time when creating widgets.  In order to save memory,
the Intrinsics may overwrite the storage allocated for the
resource list in the class record; therefore, widgets must
allocate resource lists in writable storage and must not
access the list contents directly after the class_initialize
procedure has returned.


1m9.4.	Subresources0m

A widget does not do anything to retrieve its own resources;
instead, 4mXtCreateWidget24m does this automatically before call-
ing the class initialize procedure.

Some widgets have subparts that are not widgets but for
which the widget would like to fetch resources.	 Such wid-
gets call 4mXtGetSubresources24m to accomplish this.

4mw24m	       Specifies the object used to qualify the subpart

	  or any subclass thereof.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list to override any other
	  resource specifications.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

The 4mXtGetSubresources24m function constructs a name and class
list from the application name and class, the names and
classes of all the object's ancestors, and the object
itself.	 Then it appends to this list the 4mname24m and 4mclass0m
pair passed in.	 The resources are fetched from the argument
list, the resource database, or the default values in the
resource list.	Then they are copied into the subpart
record.	 If 4margs24m is NULL, 4mnum_args24m must be zero.  However,
if 4mnum_args24m is zero, the argument list is not referenced.

4mXtGetSubresources24m may overwrite the specified resource list
with an equivalent representation in an internal format,
which optimizes access time if the list is used repeatedly.
The resource list must be allocated in writable storage, and
the caller must not modify the list contents after the call
if the same list is to be used again.  Resources fetched by
4mXtGetSubresources24m are reference-counted as if they were



			     1m2250m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


referenced by the specified object.  Subresources might
therefore be freed from the conversion cache and destroyed
when the object is destroyed, but not before then.


To fetch resources for widget subparts using varargs lists,
use 4mXtVaGetSubresources24m.

4mw24m	       Specifies the object used to qualify the subpart
	  resource name and class.  Must be of class Object

4mbase24m      Specifies the base address of the subpart data
	  structure into which the resources will be writ-
	  ten.

4mname24m      Specifies the name of the subpart.

4mclass24m     Specifies the class of the subpart.

apply to the overall application, use 4mXtGetApplicationRe-0m
4msources24m.

	  database to search (the database is that associ-
	  ated with the display for this object).  Must be
	  of class Object or any subclass thereof.

4mbase24m      Specifies the base address into which the resource
	  values will be written.

4mresources24m Specifies the resource list.

4mnum_resources0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in the resource
	  list.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list to override any other
	  resource specifications.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

The 4mXtGetApplicationResources24m function first uses the passed
object, which is usually an application shell widget, to
construct a resource name and class list.  The full name and
class of the specified object (that is, including its ances-
tors, if any) is logically added to the front of each
resource name and class.  Then it retrieves the resources
from the argument list, the resource database, or the
resource list default values.  After adding base to each
address, 4mXtGetApplicationResources24m copies the resources into
the addresses obtained by adding 4mbase24m to each 4moffset24m in the
resource list.	If 4margs24m is NULL, 4mnum_args24m must be zero.
However, if 4mnum_args24m is zero, the argument list is not ref-
erenced.  The portable way to specify application resources
is to declare them as members of a structure and pass the
address of the structure as the 4mbase24m argument.

4mXtGetApplicationResources24m may overwrite the specified
resource list with an equivalent representation in an inter-
nal format, which optimizes access time if the list is used
repeatedly.  The resource list must be allocated in writable
storage, and the caller must not modify the list contents
after the call if the same list is to be used again.  Any
per-display resources fetched by 4mXtGetApplicationResources0m



			     1m2270m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


will not be freed from the resource cache until the display
is closed.

	  of class Object or any subclass thereof.

4mbase24m      Specifies the base address into which the resource
	  values will be written.

4mresources24m Specifies the resource list for the subpart.

4mnum_resources0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in the resource
	  list.

...	  Specifies the variable argument list to override
	  any other resource specifications.

4mXtVaGetApplicationResources24m is identical in function to
4mXtGetApplicationResources24m with the 4margs24m and 4mnum_args24m parame-
ters replaced by a varargs list, as described in Section
2.5.1.


1m9.6.	Resource Conversions0m

The Intrinsics provide a mechanism for registering represen-
tation converters that are automatically invoked by the
resource-fetching routines.  The Intrinsics additionally
provide and register several commonly used converters.	This
resource conversion mechanism serves several purposes:

    It permits user and application resource files to con-
     tain textual representations of nontextual values.

    It allows textual or other representations of default
     resource values that are dependent on the display,
     screen, or colormap, and thus must be computed at



			     1m2280m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     runtime.

    It caches conversion source and result data.  Conver-
     sions that require much computation or space (for exam-
     ple, string-to-translation-table) or that require
     round-trips to the server (for example, string-to-font
     or string-to-color) are performed only once.


1m9.6.1.  Predefined Resource Converters0m

The Intrinsics define all the representations used in the
Object, RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, and Shell wid-
get classes.  The Intrinsics register the following resource
converters that accept input values of representation type
4mXtRString24m.

The String-to-Pixel conversion has two predefined constants
that are guaranteed to work and contrast with each other:
4mXtDefaultForeground24m and 4mXtDefaultBackground24m.	They evaluate
to the black and white pixel values of the widget's screen,
respectively.  If the application resource reverseVideo is
4mTrue24m, they evaluate to the white and black pixel values of
the widget's screen, respectively.  Similarly, the String-
to-Font and String-to-FontStruct converters recognize the
constant 4mXtDefaultFont24m and evaluate this in the following
manner:

    Query the resource database for the resource whose full
     name is ``xtDefaultFont'', class ``XtDefaultFont''
     (that is, no widget name/class prefixes), and use a
     type 4mXtRString24m value returned as the font name or a
     type 4mXtRFont24m or 4mXtRFontStruct24m value directly as the
     resource value.

    If the resource database does not contain a value for
     xtDefaultFont, class XtDefaultFont, or if the returned
     font name cannot be successfully opened, an implementa-
     tion-defined font in ISO8859-1 character set encoding
     is opened.	 (One possible algorithm is to perform an
     4mXListFonts24m using a wildcard font name and use the first
     font in the list.	This wildcard font name should be as
     broad as possible to maximize the probability of locat-
     ing a useable font; for example,
     "-*-*-*-R-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-1".)

    If no suitable ISO8859-1 font can be found, issue a
     warning message and return 4mFalse24m.

The String-to-FontSet converter recognizes the constant
4mXtDefaultFontSet24m and evaluate this in the following manner:

    Query the resource database for the resource whose full
     name is ``xtDefaultFontSet'', class ``XtDefault-
     FontSet'' (that is, no widget name/class prefixes), and
     use a type 4mXtRString24m value returned as the base font
     name list or a type 4mXtRFontSet24m value directly as the
     resource value.

    If the resource database does not contain a value for
     xtDefaultFontSet, class XtDefaultFontSet, or if a font
     set cannot be successfully created from this resource,
     an implementation-defined font set is created.  (One
     possible algorithm is to perform an 4mXCreateFontSet0m
     using a wildcard base font name.  This wildcard base
     font name should be as broad as possible to maximize
     the probability of locating a useable font; for exam-
     ple, "-*-*-*-R-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*".)

    If no suitable font set can be created, issue a warning
     message and return 4mFalse24m.

If a font set is created but 4mmissing_charset_list24m is not
empty, a warning is issued and the partial font set is
returned.  The Intrinsics register the String-to-FontSet
converter with a conversion argument list that extracts the
current process locale at the time the converter is invoked.
This ensures that the converter is invoked again if the same
conversion is required in a different locale.

The String-to-Gravity conversion accepts string values that
are the names of window and bit gravities and their numeri-
cal equivalents, as defined in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInter-0m
4mface24m: 4mForgetGravity24m, 4mUnmapGravity24m, 4mNorthWestGravity24m, 4mNorth-0m
4mGravity24m, 4mNorthEastGravity24m, 4mWestGravity24m, 4mCenterGravity24m, 4mEast-0m
4mGravity24m, 4mSouthWestGravity24m, 4mSouthGravity24m, 4mSouthEastGravity24m,
and 4mStaticGravity24m.	 Alphabetic case is not significant in
the conversion.

The String-to-CommandArgArray conversion parses a String
into an array of strings.  White space characters separate
elements of the command line.  The converter recognizes the
backslash character ``\'' as an escape character to allow
the following white space character to be part of the array
element.

The String-to-DirectoryString conversion recognizes the
string ``XtCurrentDirectory'' and returns the result of a
call to the operating system to get the current directory.

The String-to-RestartStyle conversion accepts the values
4mRestartIfRunning24m, 4mRestartAnyway24m, 4mRestartImmediately24m, and
4mRestartNever24m as defined by the 4mX24m 4mSession24m 4mManagement24m 4mProto-0m
4mcol24m.

The String-to-InitialState conversion accepts the values
4mNormalState24m or 4mIconicState24m as defined by the 4mInter-Client0m
4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m.

The String-to-Visual conversion calls 4mXMatchVisualInfo24m using
the 4mscreen24m and 4mdepth24m fields from the core part and returns
the first matching Visual on the list.	The widget resource
list must be certain to specify any resource of type 4mXtRVi-0m
4msual24m after the depth resource.  The allowed string values
are the visual class names defined in 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProto-0m
4mcol24m, Section 8; 4mStaticGray24m, 4mStaticColor24m, 4mTrueColor24m,

1m9.6.2.  New Resource Converters0m

Type converters use pointers to 4mXrmValue24m structures (defined
in <4mX11/Xresource.h24m>; see Section 15.4 in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage0m
4mX24m 4mInterface24m) for input and output values.

typedef struct {
     unsigned int size;
     XPointer addr;
} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;

|__

The 4maddr24m field specifies the address of the data, and the
4msize24m field gives the total number of significant bytes in
the data.  For values of type 4mString24m, 4maddr24m is the address of
the first character and 4msize24m includes the NULL-terminating
byte.

A resource converter procedure pointer is of type 4mXtTypeCon-0m
4mverter24m.

4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection with which this
	  conversion is associated.

4margs24m      Specifies a list of additional 4mXrmValue24m arguments
	  to the converter if additional context is needed
	  to perform the conversion, or NULL.  For example,
	  the String-to-Font converter needs the widget's
	  4mdisplay24m, and the String-to-Pixel converter needs
	  the widget's 4mscreen24m and 4mcolormap24m.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in 4margs24m.

4mfrom24m      Specifies the value to convert.

4mto24m	       Specifies a descriptor for a location into which
	  to store the converted value.

4mconverter_data0m
	  Specifies a location into which the converter may
	  store converter-specific data associated with this
	  conversion.
|__

The 4mdisplay24m argument is normally used only when generating
error messages, to identify the application context (with



			     1m2330m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


the function 4mXtDisplayToApplicationContext24m).

The 4mto24m argument specifies the size and location into which
the converter should store the converted value.	 If the 4maddr0m
field is NULL, the converter should allocate appropriate
storage and store the size and location into the 4mto24m descrip-
tor.  If the type converter allocates the storage, it
remains under the ownership of the converter and must not be
modified by the caller.	 The type converter is permitted to
use static storage for this purpose, and therefore the
caller must immediately copy the data upon return from the
converter.  If the 4maddr24m field is not NULL, the converter
must check the 4msize24m field to ensure that sufficient space
has been allocated before storing the converted value.	If
insufficient space is specified, the converter should update
the 4msize24m field with the number of bytes required and return
4mFalse24m without modifying the data at the specified location.
If sufficient space was allocated by the caller, the con-
verter should update the 4msize24m field with the number of bytes
actually occupied by the converted value.  For converted
values of type 4mXtRString24m, the size should include the NULL-
terminating byte, if any.  The converter may store any value
in the location specified in 4mconverter_data24m; this value will
be passed to the destructor, if any, when the resource is
freed by the Intrinsics.

The converter must return 4mTrue24m if the conversion was suc-
cessful and 4mFalse24m otherwise.  If the conversion cannot be
performed because of an improper source value, a warning
message should also be issued with 4mXtAppWarningMsg24m.


Most type converters just take the data described by the
specified 4mfrom24m argument and return data by writing into the
location specified in the 4mto24m argument.  A few need other
information, which is available in 4margs24m.  A type converter
can invoke another type converter, which allows differing
sources that may convert into a common intermediate result
to make maximum use of the type converter cache.

Note that if an address is written into 4mto->addr24m, it cannot
be that of a local variable of the converter because the
data will not be valid after the converter returns.  Static
variables may be used, as in the following example.  If the
converter modifies the resource database, the changes affect
any in-progress widget creation, 4mXtGetApplicationResources24m,
or 4mXtGetSubresources24m in an implementation-defined manner;
however, insertion of new entries or changes to existing
entries is allowed and will not directly cause an error.


The following is an example of a converter that takes a
4mstring24m and converts it to a 4mPixel24m.  Note that the 4mdisplay0m
parameter is used only to generate error messages; the



			     1m2340m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mScreen24m conversion argument is still required to inform the
Intrinsics that the converted value is a function of the
particular display (and colormap).

All type converters should define some set of conversion
values for which they are guaranteed to succeed so these can
be used in the resource defaults.  This issue arises only
with conversions, such as fonts and colors, where there is
no string representation that all server implementations
will necessarily recognize.  For resources like these, the
converter should define a symbolic constant in the same man-
ner as 4mXtDefaultForeground24m, 4mXtDefaultBackground24m, and 4mXtDe-0m
4mfaultFont24m.


To allow the Intrinsics to deallocate resources produced by
type converters, a resource destructor procedure may also be
provided.

A resource destructor procedure pointer is of type 4mXtDe-0m
4mstructor24m.

1m9.6.3.  Issuing Conversion Warnings0m

The 4mXtDisplayStringConversionWarning24m procedure is a conve-
nience routine for resource type converters that convert
from string values.

4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection with which the
	  conversion is associated.

4mfrom_value0m
	  Specifies the string that could not be converted.

The 4mXtDisplayStringConversionWarning24m procedure issues a
warning message using 4mXtAppWarningMsg24m with 4mname24m ``conver-
sionError'', 4mtype24m ``string'', 4mclass24m ``XtToolkitError'', and
the default message ``Cannot convert "4mfrom_value24m" to type
4mto_type24m''.

To issue other types of warning or error messages, the type
converter should use 4mXtAppWarningMsg24m or 4mXtAppErrorMsg24m.


To retrieve the application context associated with a given
display connection, use 4mXtDisplayToApplicationContext24m.

__
|
XtAppContext XtDisplayToApplicationContext( 4mdisplay24m )
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies an open and initialized display connec-
	  tion.

The 4mXtDisplayToApplicationContext24m function returns the
application context in which the specified 4mdisplay24m was ini-
tialized.  If the display is not known to the Intrinsics, an
error message is issued.


1m9.6.4.  Registering a New Resource Converter0m

When registering a resource converter, the client must spec-
ify the manner in which the conversion cache is to be used
when there are multiple calls to the converter.	 Conversion
cache control is specified via an 4mXtCacheType0m

argument.




			     1m2380m

typedef int XtCacheType;

An 4mXtCacheType24m field may contain one of the following val-
ues:


4mXtCacheNone0m

     Specifies that the results of a previous conversion may
     not be reused to satisfy any other resource requests;
     the specified converter will be called each time the
     converted value is required.


4mXtCacheAll0m

     Specifies that the results of a previous conversion
     should be reused for any resource request that depends
     upon the same source value and conversion arguments.


4mXtCacheByDisplay0m

     Specifies that the results of a previous conversion
     should be used as for 4mXtCacheAll24m but the destructor
     will be called, if specified, if 4mXtCloseDisplay24m is
     called for the display connection associated with the
     converted value, and the value will be removed from the
     conversion cache.

The qualifier 4mXtCacheRefCount24m may be ORed with any of the
above values.  If 4mXtCacheRefCount24m is specified, calls to
4mXtCreateWidget24m, 4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m, 4mXtGetApplicationRe-0m
4msources24m, and 4mXtGetSubresources24m that use the converted value
will be counted.  When a widget using the converted value is
destroyed, the count is decremented, and, if the count
reaches zero, the destructor procedure will be called and
the converted value will be removed from the conversion
cache.


To register a type converter for all application contexts in
a process, use 4mXtSetTypeConverter24m, and to register a type
converter in a single application context, use 4mXtAppSetType-0m

For the few type converters that need additional arguments,
the Intrinsics conversion mechanism provides a method of
specifying how these arguments should be computed.  The enu-
merated type 4mXtAddressMode24m and the structure 4mXtConvertArgRec0m
specify how each argument is derived.  These are defined in

	  4mXtCallConverter24m or 4mXtDirectConvert24m.

4msize24m      Passes a pointer to the 4msize24m field from the 4mXtCon-0m
	  4mvertArgRec24m.

4mvalue24m     Passes a pointer to a descriptor into which the
	  procedure must store the conversion argument.
|__

When invoked, the 4mXtConvertArgProc24m procedure must derive a
conversion argument and store the address and size of the
argument in the location pointed to by 4mvalue24m.

In order to permit reentrancy, the 4mXtConvertArgProc24m should
return the address of storage whose lifetime is no shorter
than the lifetime of 4mobject24m.  If 4mobject24m is NULL, the life-
time of the conversion argument must be no shorter than the
lifetime of the resource with which the conversion argument
is associated.	The Intrinsics do not guarantee to copy this
storage but do guarantee not to reference it if the resource
is removed from the conversion cache.

The following example illustrates how to register the Cvt-
StringToPixel routine given earlier:


     static XtConvertArgRec colorConvertArgs[] = {
       {XtWidgetBaseOffset, (XtPointer)XtOffset(Widget, core.screen),  sizeof(Screen*)},
       {XtWidgetBaseOffset, (XtPointer)XtOffset(Widget, core.colormap),sizeof(Colormap)}
     };

     XtSetTypeConverter(XtRString, XtRPixel, CvtStringToPixel,
	 colorConvertArgs, XtNumber(colorConvertArgs), XtCacheByDisplay, NULL);


The conversion argument descriptors 4mcolorConvertArgs24m and
4mscreenConvertArg24m are predefined by the Intrinsics.	 Both
take the values from the closest windowed ancestor if the
object is not of a subclass of Core.  The 4mscreenConvertArg0m
descriptor puts the widget's 4mscreen24m field into 4margs24m[0].  The
4mcolorConvertArgs24m descriptor puts the widget's 4mscreen24m field
into 4margs24m[0], and the widget's 4mcolormap24m field into 4margs24m[1].

Conversion routines should not just put a descriptor for the
address of the base of the widget into 4margs24m[0], and use that



			     1m2430m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


in the routine.	 They should pass in the actual values on
which the conversion depends.  By keeping the dependencies
of the conversion procedure specific, it is more likely that
subsequent conversions will find what they need in the con-
version cache.	This way the cache is smaller and has fewer
and more widely applicable entries.

If any conversion arguments of type 4mXtBaseOffset24m, 4mXtRe-0m
4msourceString24m, 4mXtResourceQuark24m, and 4mXtWidgetBaseOffset24m are
specified for conversions performed by 4mXtGetApplicationRe-0m
4msources24m, 4mXtGetSubresources24m, 4mXtVaGetApplicationResources24m, or
4mXtVaGetSubresources24m, the arguments are computed with respect
to the specified widget, not the base address or resource
list specified in the call.

If the 4mXtConvertArgProc24m modifies the resource database, the
changes affect any in-progress widget creation, 4mXtGetAppli-0m
4mcationResources24m, or 4mXtGetSubresources24m in an implementation-
defined manner; however, insertion of new entries or changes
to existing entries are allowed and will not directly cause
an error.


1m9.6.5.  Resource Converter Invocation0m

All resource-fetching routines (for example, 4mXtGetSubre-0m
4msources24m, 4mXtGetApplicationResources24m, and so on) call resource
converters if the resource database or varargs list speci-
fies a value that has a different representation from the
desired representation or if the widget's default resource
value representation is different from the desired represen-
tation.


To invoke explicit resource conversions, use 4mXtConvertAnd-0m
4mStore24m or 4mXtCallConverter24m.

The 4mXtCallConverter24m function looks up the specified type
converter in the application context associated with the
display and, if the converter was not registered or was reg-
istered with cache type 4mXtCacheAll24m or 4mXtCacheByDisplay24m,
looks in the conversion cache to see if this conversion pro-
cedure has been called with the specified conversion argu-
ments.	If so, it checks the success status of the prior
call, and if the conversion failed, 4mXtCallConverter24m returns
4mFalse24m immediately; otherwise it checks the size specified in
the 4mto24m argument, and, if it is greater than or equal to the
size stored in the cache, copies the information stored in
the cache into the location specified by 4mto->addr24m, stores
the cache size into 4mto->size24m, and returns 4mTrue24m.  If the size
specified in the 4mto24m argument is smaller than the size stored
in the cache, 4mXtCallConverter24m copies the cache size into
4mto->size24m and returns 4mFalse24m.  If the converter was registered
with cache type 4mXtCacheNone24m or no value was found in the
conversion cache, 4mXtCallConverter24m calls the converter, and



			     1m2450m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


if it was not registered with cache type 4mXtCacheNone24m, enters
the result in the cache.  4mXtCallConverter24m then returns what
the converter returned.

The 4mcache_ref_return24m field specifies storage allocated by
the caller in which an opaque value will be stored.  If the
type converter has been registered with the 4mXtCacheRefCount0m
modifier and if the value returned in 4mcache_ref_return24m is
non-NULL, then the caller should store the 4mcache_ref_return0m
value in order to decrement the reference count when the
converted value is no longer required.	The 4mcache_ref_return0m
argument should be NULL if the caller is unwilling or unable
to store the value.


To explicitly decrement the reference counts for resources
obtained from 4mXtCallConverter24m, use 4mXtAppReleaseCacheRefs24m.

	  Specifies the application context.

4mrefs24m      Specifies the list of cache references to be

4mXtAppReleaseCacheRefs24m decrements the reference count for the
conversion entries identified by the 4mrefs24m argument.  This
argument is a pointer to a NULL-terminated list of
4mXtCacheRef24m values.	 If any reference count reaches zero, the
destructor, if any, will be called and the resource removed
from the conversion cache.


As a convenience to clients needing to explicitly decrement
reference counts via a callback function, the Intrinsics
define two callback procedures, 4mXtCallbackReleaseCacheRef0m
and 4mXtCallbackReleaseCacheRefList24m.

4mobject24m    Specifies the object to use for additional argu-

4mfrom_type24m Specifies the source type.

4mfrom24m      Specifies the value to be converted.

4mto_type24m   Specifies the destination type.

4mto_in_out24m Specifies a descriptor for storage into which the
	  converted value will be returned.
|__

The 4mXtConvertAndStore24m function looks up the type converter
registered to convert 4mfrom_type24m to 4mto_type24m, computes any
additional arguments needed, and then calls 4mXtCallConverter0m
(or 4mXtDirectConvert24m if an old-style converter was registered
with 4mXtAddConverter24m or 4mXtAppAddConverter24m; see Appendix C)
with the 4mfrom24m and 4mto_in_out24m arguments.  The 4mto_in_out24m argu-
ment specifies the size and location into which the con-
verted value will be stored and is passed directly to the
converter.  If the location is specified as NULL, it will be
replaced with a pointer to private storage and the size will
be returned in the descriptor.	The caller is expected to
copy this private storage immediately and must not modify it
in any way.  If a non-NULL location is specified, the caller
must allocate sufficient storage to hold the converted value
and must also specify the size of that storage in the
descriptor.  The 4msize24m field will be modified on return to
indicate the actual size of the converted data.	 If the con-
version succeeds, 4mXtConvertAndStore24m returns 4mTrue24m; otherwise,
it returns 4mFalse24m.

4mXtConvertAndStore24m adds 4mXtCallbackReleaseCacheRef24m to the
destroyCallback list of the specified object if the conver-
sion returns an 4mXtCacheRef24m value.	The resulting resource
should not be referenced after the object has been
destroyed.

4mXtCreateWidget24m performs processing equivalent to 4mXtConver-0m
4mtAndStore24m when initializing the object instance.  Because
there is extra memory overhead required to implement refer-
ence counting, clients may distinguish those objects that



			     1m2480m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


are never destroyed before the application exits from those
that may be destroyed and whose resources should be deallo-
cated.

To specify whether reference counting is to be enabled for
the resources of a particular object when the object is cre-
ated, the client can specify a value for the 4mBoolean0m
resource XtNinitialResourcesPersistent, class XtCInitialRe-
sourcesPersistent.

When 4mXtCreateWidget24m is called, if this resource is not spec-
ified as 4mFalse24m in either the arglist or the resource data-
base, then the resources referenced by this object are not
reference-counted, regardless of how the type converter may
have been registered.  The effective default value is 4mTrue24m;
thus clients that expect to destroy one or more objects and
want resources deallocated must explicitly specify 4mFalse24m for
XtNinitialResourcesPersistent.

The resources are still freed and destructors called when
4mXtCloseDisplay24m is called if the conversion was registered as
4mXtCacheByDisplay24m.


1m9.7.	Reading and Writing Widget State0m

Any resource field in a widget can be read or written by a
client.	 On a write operation, the widget decides what
changes it will actually allow and updates all derived
fields appropriately.


1m9.7.1.  Obtaining Widget State0m

To retrieve the current values of resources associated with
a widget instance, use 4mXtGetValues24m.

      Widget 4mobject24m;

      Cardinal 4mnum_args24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies the object whose resource values are to

	  class thereof.

4margs24m      Specifies the argument list of name/address pairs
	  that contain the resource names and the addresses
	  into which the resource values are to be stored.
	  The resource names are widget-dependent.

4mnum_args24m  Specifies the number of entries in the argument
	  list.
|__

The 4mXtGetValues24m function starts with the resources specified
for the Object class and proceeds down the subclass chain to
the class of the object.  The 4mvalue24m field of a passed argu-
ment list must contain the address into which to copy the
contents of the corresponding object instance field.  If the
field is a pointer type, the lifetime of the pointed-to data
is defined by the object class.	 For the Intrinsics-defined
resources, the following lifetimes apply:

  Not valid following any operation that modifies the
   resource:

   -  XtNchildren resource of composite widgets.

   -  All resources of representation type XtRCallback.

  Remain valid at least until the widget is destroyed:

   -  XtNaccelerators, XtNtranslations.

  Remain valid until the Display is closed:

   -  XtNscreen.

It is the caller's responsibility to allocate and deallocate
storage for the copied data according to the size of the
resource representation type used within the object.

If the class of the object's parent is a subclass of 4mcon-0m
4mstraintWidgetClass24m, 4mXtGetValues24m then fetches the values for
any constraint resources requested.  It starts with the con-
straint resources specified for 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m and
proceeds down the subclass chain to the parent's constraint
resources.  If the argument list contains a resource name



			     1m2500m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


that is not found in any of the resource lists searched, the
value at the corresponding address is not modified.  If any
get_values_hook procedures in the object's class or super-
class records are non-NULL, they are called in superclass-
to-subclass order after all the resource values have been
fetched by 4mXtGetValues24m.  Finally, if the object's parent is
a subclass of 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m, and if any of the par-
ent's class or superclass records have declared 4mConstraint-0m
4mClassExtension24m records in the Constraint class part 4mexten-0m
4msion24m field with a record type of 4mNULLQUARK24m, and if the
4mget_values_hook24m field in the extension record is non-NULL,
4mXtGetValues24m calls the get_values_hook procedures in super-
class-to-subclass order.  This permits a Constraint parent
to provide nonresource data via 4mXtGetValues24m.

Get_values_hook procedures may modify the data stored at the
location addressed by the 4mvalue24m field, including (but not
limited to) making a copy of data whose resource representa-
tion is a pointer.  None of the Intrinsics-defined object
classes copy data in this manner.  Any operation that modi-
fies the queried object resource may invalidate the pointed-
to data.



To retrieve the current values of resources associated with
a widget instance using varargs lists, use 4mXtVaGetValues24m.

4mXtVaGetValues24m is identical in function to 4mXtGetValues24m with
the 4margs24m and 4mnum_args24m parameters replaced by a varargs list,
as described in Section 2.5.1.	All value entries in the
list must specify pointers to storage allocated by the
caller to which the resource value will be copied.  It is
the caller's responsibility to ensure that sufficient stor-
age is allocated.  If 4mXtVaTypedArg24m is specified, the 4mtype0m
argument specifies the representation desired by the caller
and 4mthe24m size argument specifies the number of bytes allo-
cated to store the result of the conversion.  If the size is
insufficient, a warning message is issued and the list entry
is skipped.

The 4mXtGetSubvalues24m function obtains resource values from the

The 4mXtSetValues24m function starts with the resources specified
for the Object class fields and proceeds down the subclass
chain to the object.  At each stage, it replaces the 4mobject0m
resource fields with any values specified in the argument
list.  4mXtSetValues24m then calls the set_values procedures for
the object in superclass-to-subclass order.  If the object
has any non-NULL 4mset_values_hook24m fields, these are called
immediately after the corresponding set_values procedure.
This procedure permits subclasses to set subpart data via
4mXtSetValues24m.

If the class of the object's parent is a subclass of 4mcon-0m
4mstraintWidgetClass24m, 4mXtSetValues24m also updates the object's
constraints.  It starts with the constraint resources speci-
fied for 4mconstraintWidgetClass24m and proceeds down the sub-
class chain to the parent's class.  At each stage, it
replaces the constraint resource fields with any values
specified in the argument list.	 It then calls the con-
straint set_values procedures from 4mconstraintWidgetClass0m
down to the parent's class.  The constraint set_values pro-
cedures are called with widget arguments, as for all
set_values procedures, not just the constraint records, so
that they can make adjustments to the desired values based
on full information about the widget.  Any arguments speci-
fied that do not match a resource list entry are silently
ignored.

If the object is of a subclass of RectObj, 4mXtSetValues0m
determines if a geometry request is needed by comparing the
old object to the new object.  If any geometry changes are
required, 4mXtSetValues24m restores the original geometry and
makes the request on behalf of the widget.  If the geometry
manager returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m, 4mXtSetValues24m calls the
object's resize procedure.  If the geometry manager returns
4mXtGeometryDone24m, 4mXtSetValues24m continues, as the object's



			     1m2550m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


resize procedure should have been called by the geometry
manager.  If the geometry manager returns 4mXtGeometryNo24m,
4mXtSetValues24m ignores the geometry request and continues.  If
the geometry manager returns 4mXtGeometryAlmost24m, 4mXtSetValues0m
calls the set_values_almost procedure, which determines what
should be done.	 4mXtSetValues24m then repeats this process,
deciding once more whether the geometry manager should be
called.

Finally, if any of the set_values procedures returned 4mTrue24m,
and the widget is realized, 4mXtSetValues24m causes the widget's
expose procedure to be invoked by calling 4mXClearArea24m on the
widget's window.


To modify the current values of resources associated with a
widget instance using varargs lists, use 4mXtVaSetValues24m.

4mXtVaSetValues24m is identical in function to 4mXtSetValues24m with

The set_values procedure should recompute any field derived
from resources that are changed (for example, many GCs
depend on foreground and background pixels).  If no recompu-
tation is necessary, and if none of the resources specific
to a subclass require the window to be redisplayed when
their values are changed, you can specify NULL for the
4mset_values24m field in the class record.

Like the initialize procedure, set_values mostly deals only
with the fields defined in the subclass, but it has to
resolve conflicts with its superclass, especially conflicts
over width and height.

Sometimes a subclass may want to overwrite values filled in
by its superclass.  In particular, size calculations of a
superclass are often incorrect for a subclass, and, in this
case, the subclass must modify or recalculate fields
declared and computed by its superclass.

As an example, a subclass can visually surround its super-
class display.	In this case, the width and height calcu-
lated by the superclass set_values procedure are too small
and need to be incremented by the size of the surround.	 The
subclass needs to know if its superclass's size was calcu-
lated by the superclass or was specified explicitly.  All
widgets must place themselves into whatever size is



			     1m2570m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


explicitly given, but they should compute a reasonable size
if no size is requested.  How does a subclass know the dif-
ference between a specified size and a size computed by a
superclass?

The 4mrequest24m and 4mnew24m parameters provide the necessary infor-
mation.	 The 4mrequest24m widget is a copy of the widget, updated
as originally requested.  The 4mnew24m widget starts with the
values in the request, but it has additionally been updated
by all superclass set_values procedures called so far.	A
subclass set_values procedure can compare these two to
resolve any potential conflicts.  The set_values procedure
need not refer to the 4mrequest24m widget unless it must resolve
conflicts between the 4mcurrent24m and 4mnew24m widgets.  Any changes
the widget needs to make, including geometry changes, should
be made in the 4mnew24m widget.

In the above example, the subclass with the visual surround
can see if the 4mwidth24m and 4mheight24m in the 4mrequest24m widget are
zero.  If so, it adds its surround size to the 4mwidth24m and
4mheight24m fields in the 4mnew24m widget.  If not, it must make do
with the size originally specified.  In this case, zero is a
special value defined by the class to permit the application
to invoke this behavior.

The 4mnew24m widget is the actual widget instance record.  There-
fore, the set_values procedure should do all its work on the
4mnew24m widget; the 4mrequest24m widget should never be modified.  If
the set_values procedure needs to call any routines that
operate on a widget, it should specify 4mnew24m as the widget
instance.

Before calling the set_values procedures, the Intrinsics
modify the resources of the 4mrequest24m widget according to the
contents of the arglist; if the widget names all its
resources in the class resource list, it is never necessary
to examine the contents of 4margs24m.

Finally, the set_values procedure must return a Boolean that
indicates whether the widget needs to be redisplayed.  Note
that a change in the geometry fields alone does not require
the set_values procedure to return 4mTrue24m; the X server will
eventually generate an 4mExpose24m event, if necessary.	 After
calling all the set_values procedures, 4mXtSetValues24m forces a
redisplay by calling 4mXClearArea24m if any of the set_values
procedures returned 4mTrue24m.	Therefore, a set_values procedure
should not try to do its own redisplaying.

Set_values procedures should not do any work in response to
changes in geometry because 4mXtSetValues24m eventually will per-
form a geometry request, and that request might be denied.
If the widget actually changes size in response to a call to
4mXtSetValues24m, its resize procedure is called.  Widgets should
do any geometry-related work in their resize procedure.



			     1m2580m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Note that it is permissible to call 4mXtSetValues24m before a
widget is realized.  Therefore, the set_values procedure
must not assume that the widget is realized.


1m9.7.2.2.  Widget State: The set_values_almost Procedure0m

The set_values_almost procedure pointer in the widget class
record is of type 4mXtAlmostProc24m.

__

typedef void (*XtAlmostProc)(Widget, Widget, XtWidgetGeometry*, XtWidgetGeometry*);
      Widget 4mold24m;
      Widget 4mnew24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mrequest24m;
      XtWidgetGeometry *4mreply24m;


4mold24m       Specifies a copy of the object as it was before
	  the 4mXtSetValues24m call.

4mnew24m       Specifies the object instance record.

4mrequest24m   Specifies the original geometry request that was
	  sent to the geometry manager that caused 4mXtGeome-0m
	  4mtryAlmost24m to be returned.

4mreply24m     Specifies the compromise geometry that was
	  returned by the geometry manager with 4mXtGeome-0m
	  4mtryAlmost24m.
|__

Most classes inherit the set_values_almost procedure from
their superclass by specifying 4mXtInheritSetValuesAlmost24m in
the class initialization.  The set_values_almost procedure
in 4mrectObjClass24m accepts the compromise suggested.

The set_values_almost procedure is called when a client
tries to set a widget's geometry by means of a call to
4mXtSetValues24m and the geometry manager cannot satisfy the
request but instead returns 4mXtGeometryNo24m or 4mXtGeometryAlmost0m
and a compromise geometry.  The 4mnew24m object is the actual
instance record.  The 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mwidth24m, 4mheight24m, and 4mborder_width0m
fields contain the original values as they were before the
4mXtSetValues24m call, and all other fields contain the new val-
ues.  The 4mrequest24m parameter contains the new geometry
request that was made to the parent.  The 4mreply24m parameter
contains 4mreply->request_mode24m equal to zero if the parent
returned 4mXtGeometryNo24m and contains the parent's compromise
geometry otherwise.  The set_values_almost procedure takes
the original geometry and the compromise geometry and deter-
mines if the compromise is acceptable or whether to try a
different compromise.  It returns its results in the 4mrequest0m



			     1m2590m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


parameter, which is then sent back to the geometry manager
for another try.  To accept the compromise, the procedure
must copy the contents of the 4mreply24m geometry into the
4mrequest24m geometry; to attempt an alternative geometry, the
procedure may modify any part of the 4mrequest24m argument; to
terminate the geometry negotiation and retain the original
geometry, the procedure must set 4mrequest->request_mode24m to
zero.  The geometry fields of the 4mold24m and 4mnew24m instances must
not be modified directly.


1m9.7.2.3.  Widget State: The ConstraintClassPart set_values0m
1mProcedure0m

The constraint set_values procedure pointer is of type
4mXtSetValuesFunc24m.  The values passed to the parent's con-
straint set_values procedure are the same as those passed to
the child's class set_values procedure.	 A class can specify
NULL for the 4mset_values24m field of the 4mConstraintPart24m if it
need not compute anything.

The constraint set_values procedure should recompute any
constraint fields derived from constraint resources that are
changed.  Furthermore, it may modify other widget fields as
appropriate.  For example, if a constraint for the maximum
height of a widget is changed to a value smaller than the
widget's current height, the constraint set_values procedure
may reset the 4mheight24m field in the widget.


1m9.7.2.4.  Widget Subpart State0m

		   1mTranslation Management0m



Except under unusual circumstances, widgets do not hardwire
the mapping of user events into widget behavior by using the
event manager.	Instead, they provide a default mapping of
events into behavior that you can override.

The translation manager provides an interface to specify and
manage the mapping of X event sequences into widget-supplied
functionality, for example, calling procedure 4mAbc24m when the 4my0m
key is pressed.

The translation manager uses two kinds of tables to perform
translations:

    The action tables, which are in the widget class struc-
     ture, specify the mapping of externally available pro-
     cedure name strings to the corresponding procedure
     implemented by the widget class.

    A translation table, which is in the widget class
     structure, specifies the mapping of event sequences to
     procedure name strings.

You can override the translation table in the class struc-
ture for a specific widget instance by supplying a different
translation table for the widget instance.  The resources
XtNtranslations and XtNbaseTranslations are used to modify
the class default translation table; see Section 10.3.


1m10.1.	 Action Tables0m

All widget class records contain an action table, an array
of 4mXtActionsRec24m entries.  In addition, an application can
register its own action tables with the translation manager
so that the translation tables it provides to widget
instances can access application functionality directly.
The translation action procedure pointer is of type 4mXtAc-0m
4mtionProc24m.

      XEvent *4mevent24m;
      String *4mparams24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_params24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that caused the action to be
	  called.

4mevent24m     Specifies the event that caused the action to be
	  called.  If the action is called after a sequence
	  of events, then the last event in the sequence is
	  used.

4mparams24m    Specifies a pointer to the list of strings that
	  were specified in the translation table as argu-
	  ments to the action, or NULL.

4mnum_params0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in 4mparams24m.


typedef struct _XtActionsRec {
     String string;
     XtActionProc proc;
} XtActionsRec, *XtActionList;

|__

The 4mstring24m field is the name used in translation tables to
access the procedure.  The 4mproc24m field is a pointer to a pro-
cedure that implements the functionality.

When the action list is specified as the 4mCoreClassPart0m
4mactions24m field, the string pointed to by 4mstring24m must be per-
manently allocated prior to or during the execution of the
class initialization procedure and must not be subsequently
deallocated.

Action procedures should not assume that the widget in which
they are invoked is realized; an accelerator specification
can cause an action procedure to be called for a widget that
does not yet have a window.  Widget writers should also note
which of a widget's callback lists are invoked from action
procedures and warn clients not to assume the widget is
realized in those callbacks.

For example, a Pushbutton widget has procedures to take the
following actions:

    Set the button to indicate it is activated.




			     1m2650m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Unset the button back to its normal mode.

    Highlight the button borders.

    Unhighlight the button borders.

    Notify any callbacks that the button has been acti-
     vated.

The action table for the Pushbutton widget class makes these
functions available to translation tables written for Push-
button or any subclass.	 The string entry is the name used
in translation tables.	The procedure entry (usually spelled
identically to the string) is the name of the C procedure
that implements that function:


     XtActionsRec actionTable[] = {
	  {"Set",   Set},
	  {"Unset", Unset},
	  {"Highlight",Highlight},
	  {"Unhighlight",Unhighlight}
	  {"Notify",Notify},
     };


The Intrinsics reserve all action names and parameters
starting with the characters ``Xt'' for future standard
enhancements.  Users, applications, and widgets should not
declare action names or pass parameters starting with these
characters except to invoke specified built-in Intrinsics
functions.


1m10.1.1.  Action Table Registration0m

The 4mactions24m and 4mnum_actions24m fields of 4mCoreClassPart24m specify
the actions implemented by a widget class.  These are auto-
matically registered with the Intrinsics when the class is
initialized and must be allocated in writable storage prior
to Core class_part initialization, and never deallocated.
To save memory and optimize access, the Intrinsics may over-
write the storage in order to compile the list into an
internal representation.


To declare an action table within an application and regis-
ter it with the translation manager, use 4mXtAppAddActions24m.









			     1m2660m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtAppAddActions(4mapp_context24m, 4mactions24m, 4mnum_actions24m)
      XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
      XtActionList 4mactions24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_actions24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.

4mactions24m   Specifies the action table to register.

4mnum_actions0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in this action ta-
	  ble.
|__

If more than one action is registered with the same name,
the most recently registered action is used.  If duplicate
actions exist in an action table, the first is used.  The
Intrinsics register an action table containing 4mXtMenuPopup0m
and 4mXtMenuPopdown24m as part of 4mXtCreateApplicationContext24m.


1m10.1.2.  Action Names to Procedure Translations0m

The translation manager uses a simple algorithm to resolve
the name of a procedure specified in a translation table
into the actual procedure specified in an action table.
When the widget is realized, the translation manager per-
forms a search for the name in the following tables, in
order:

    The widget's class and all superclass action tables, in
     subclass-to-superclass order.

    The parent's class and all superclass action tables, in
     subclass-to-superclass order, then on up the ancestor
     tree.

    The action tables registered with 4mXtAppAddActions24m and
     4mXtAddActions24m from the most recently added table to the
     oldest table.

As soon as it finds a name, the translation manager stops
the search.  If it cannot find a name, the translation man-
ager generates a warning message.


1m10.1.3.  Action Hook Registration0m

An application can specify a procedure that will be called
just before every action routine is dispatched by the trans-
lation manager.	 To do so, the application supplies a



			     1m2670m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


procedure pointer of type 4mXtActionHookProc24m.

__
|

      XEvent* 4mevent24m;
      String* 4mparams24m;
      Cardinal* 4mnum_params24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget whose action is about to be
	  dispatched.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies the application-specific closure that
	  was passed to 4mXtAppAddActionHook.0m

4maction_name0m

4mevent24m     Specifies the event argument that will be passed
	  to the action routine.

4mparams24m    Specifies the action parameters that will be
	  passed to the action routine.

4mnum_params0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in 4mparams24m.
|__

Action hooks should not modify any of the data pointed to by
the arguments other than the 4mclient_data24m argument.


To add an action hook, use 4mXtAppAddActionHook24m.

      XtPointer 4mclient_data24m;


4mapp24m       Specifies the application context.

4mproc24m      Specifies the action hook procedure.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies application-specific data to be passed
	  to the action hook.
|__

4mXtAppAddActionHook24m adds the specified procedure to the front
of a list maintained in the application context.  In the
future, when an action routine is about to be invoked for
any widget in this application context, either through the
translation manager or via 4mXtCallActionProc24m, the action hook
procedures will be called in reverse order of registration
just prior to invoking the action routine.

Action hook procedures are removed automatically and the
4mXtActionHookId24mis destroyed when the application context in
which they were added is destroyed.


To remove an action hook procedure without destroying the
application context, use 4mXtRemoveActionHook24m.

__
|
void XtRemoveActionHook(4mid24m)
      XtActionHookId 4mid24m;


4mid24m	       Specifies the action hook id returned by 4mXtAppAd-0m
	  4mdActionHook24m.
|__

4mXtRemoveActionHook24m removes the specified action hook proce-
dure from the list in which it was registered.


1m10.2.	 Translation Tables0m

All widget instance records contain a translation table,
which is a resource with a default value specified elsewhere
in the class record.  A translation table specifies what
action procedures are invoked for an event or a sequence of
events.	 A translation table is a string containing a list
of translations from an event sequence into one or more



			     1m2690m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


action procedure calls.	 The translations are separated from
one another by newline characters (ASCII LF).  The complete
syntax of translation tables is specified in Appendix B.

As an example, the default behavior of Pushbutton is

    Highlight on enter window.

    Unhighlight on exit window.

    Invert on left button down.

    Call callbacks and reinvert on left button up.

The following illustrates Pushbutton's default translation
table:


     static String defaultTranslations =
	  "<EnterWindow>:Highlight()\n\
	  <LeaveWindow>:Unhighlight()\n\
	  <Btn1Down>:Set()\n\
	  <Btn1Up>: Notify() Unset()";


The 4mtm_table24m field of the 4mCoreClassPart24m should be filled in
at class initialization time with the string containing the
class's default translations.  If a class wants to inherit
its superclass's translations, it can store the special
value 4mXtInheritTranslations24m into 4mtm_table24m.  In Core's class
part initialization procedure, the Intrinsics compile this
translation table into an efficient internal form.  Then, at
widget creation time, this default translation table is com-
bined with the XtNtranslations and XtNbaseTranslations
resources; see Section 10.3.

The resource conversion mechanism automatically compiles
string translation tables that are specified in the resource
database.  If a client uses translation tables that are not
retrieved via a resource conversion, it must compile them
itself using 4mXtParseTranslationTable24m.

The Intrinsics use the compiled form of the translation ta-
ble to register the necessary events with the event manager.
Widgets need do nothing other than specify the action and
translation tables for events to be processed by the trans-
lation manager.

An event sequence is a comma-separated list of X event
descriptions that describes a specific sequence of X events
to map to a set of program actions.  Each X event



			     1m2700m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


description consists of three parts: The X event type, a
prefix consisting of the X modifier bits, and an event-spe-
cific suffix.

Various abbreviations are supported to make translation
tables easier to read.	The events must match incoming
events in left-to-right order to trigger the action
sequence.


1m10.2.2.  Action Sequences0m

Action sequences specify what program or widget actions to
take in response to incoming X events. An action sequence
consists of space-separated action procedure call specifica-
tions.	Each action procedure call consists of the name of
an action procedure and a parenthesized list of zero or more
comma-separated string parameters to pass to that procedure.
The actions are invoked in left-to-right order as specified
in the action sequence.


1m10.2.3.  Multi-Click Time0m

Translation table entries may specify actions that are taken
when two or more identical events occur consecutively within
a short time interval, called the multi-click time.  The
multi-click time value may be specified as an application
resource with name ``multiClickTime'' and class ``Mul-
tiClickTime'' and may also be modified dynamically by the
application.  The multi-click time is unique for each Dis-
play value and is retrieved from the resource database by
4mXtDisplayInitialize24m.  If no value is specified, the initial
value is 200 milliseconds.


To set the multi-click time dynamically, use 4mXtSetMul-0m
4mtiClickTime24m.

__
|
void XtSetMultiClickTime(4mdisplay24m, 4mtime24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      int 4mtime24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection.

4mtime24m      Specifies the multi-click time in milliseconds.
|__

4mXtSetMultiClickTime24m sets the time interval used by the
translation manager to determine when multiple events are
interpreted as a repeated event.  When a repeat count is



			     1m2710m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


specified in a translation entry, the interval between the
timestamps in each pair of repeated events (e.g., between
two 4mButtonPress24m events) must be less than the multi-click
time in order for the translation actions to be taken.


To read the multi-click time, use 4mXtGetMultiClickTime24m.

__
|
int XtGetMultiClickTime(4mdisplay24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection.
|__

4mXtGetMultiClickTime24m returns the time in milliseconds that
the translation manager uses to determine if multiple events
are to be interpreted as a repeated event for purposes of
matching a translation entry containing a repeat count.


1m10.3.	 Translation Table Management0m

Sometimes an application needs to merge its own translations
with a widget's translations.  For example, a window manager
provides functions to move a window.  The window manager
wishes to bind this operation to a specific pointer button
in the title bar without the possibility of user override
and bind it to other buttons that may be overridden by the
user.

To accomplish this, the window manager should first create
the title bar and then should merge the two translation
tables into the title bar's translations.  One translation
table contains the translations that the window manager
wants only if the user has not specified a translation for a
particular event or event sequence (i.e., those that may be
overridden).  The other translation table contains the
translations that the window manager wants regardless of
what the user has specified.

Three Intrinsics functions support this merging:

4mXtParseTransla-24m	    Compiles a translation table.
4mtionTable0m

4mXtAugmentTransla-24m	    Merges a compiled translation table
4mtions24m		    into a widget's compiled translation
		       table, ignoring any new translations
		       that conflict with existing transla-
		       tions.




			     1m2720m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtOverrideTransla-24m	    Merges a compiled translation table
4mtions24m		    into a widget's compiled translation
		       table, replacing any existing trans-
		       lations that conflict with new trans-
		       lations.



To compile a translation table, use 4mXtParseTranslationTable24m.

__
|
XtTranslations XtParseTranslationTable(4mtable24m)
      String 4mtable24m;


4mtable24m     Specifies the translation table to compile.
|__

The 4mXtParseTranslationTable24m function compiles the transla-
tion table, provided in the format given in Appendix B, into
an opaque internal representation of type 4mXtTranslations24m.
Note that if an empty translation table is required for any
purpose, one can be obtained by calling 4mXtParseTransla-0m
4mtionTable24m and passing an empty string.


To merge additional translations into an existing transla-
tion table, use 4mXtAugmentTranslations24m.

__
|
void XtAugmentTranslations(4mw24m, 4mtranslations24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtTranslations 4mtranslations24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget into which the new transla-
	  tions are to be merged.  Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mtranslations0m
	  Specifies the compiled translation table to merge
	  in.
|__

The 4mXtAugmentTranslations24m function merges the new transla-
tions into the existing widget translations, ignoring any
4m#replace24m, 4m#augment24m, or 4m#override24m directive that may have
been specified in the translation string.  The translation
table specified by 4mtranslations24m is not altered by this
process.  4mXtAugmentTranslations24m logically appends the string
representation of the new translations to the string repre-
sentation of the widget's current translations and reparses



			     1m2730m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


the result with no warning messages about duplicate left-
hand sides, then stores the result back into the widget
instance; i.e., if the new translations contain an event or
event sequence that already exists in the widget's transla-
tions, the new translation is ignored.


To overwrite existing translations with new translations,
use 4mXtOverrideTranslations24m.

__
|
void XtOverrideTranslations(4mw24m, 4mtranslations24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      XtTranslations 4mtranslations24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget into which the new transla-
	  tions are to be merged. Must be of class Core or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mtranslations0m
	  Specifies the compiled translation table to merge
	  in.
|__

The 4mXtOverrideTranslations24m function merges the new transla-
tions into the existing widget translations, ignoring any
4m#replace24m, 4m#augment24m, or 4m#override24m directive that may have
been specified in the translation string.  The translation
table specified by 4mtranslations24m is not altered by this
process.  4mXtOverrideTranslations24m logically appends the
string representation of the widget's current translations
to the string representation of the new translations and
reparses the result with no warning messages about duplicate
left-hand sides, then stores the result back into the widget
instance; i.e., if the new translations contain an event or
event sequence that already exists in the widget's transla-
tions, the new translation overrides the widget's transla-
tion.

To replace a widget's translations completely, use 4mXtSetVal-0m
4mues24m on the XtNtranslations resource and specify a compiled
translation table as the value.


To make it possible for users to easily modify translation
tables in their resource files, the string-to-translation-
table resource type converter allows the string to specify
whether the table should replace, augment, or override any
existing translation table in the widget.  To specify this,
a pound sign (#) is given as the first character of the ta-
ble followed by one of the keywords ``replace'', ``aug-
ment'', or ``override'' to indicate whether to replace,



			     1m2740m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


augment, or override the existing table.  The replace or
merge operation is performed during the Core instance ini-
tialization.  Each merge operation produces a new transla-
tion resource value; if the original tables were shared by
other widgets, they are unaffected.  If no directive is
specified, ``#replace'' is assumed.

At instance initialization the XtNtranslations resource is
first fetched.	Then, if it was not specified or did not
contain ``#replace'', the resource database is searched for
the resource XtNbaseTranslations.  If XtNbaseTranslations is
found, it is merged into the widget class translation table.
Then the widget 4mtranslations24m field is merged into the result
or into the class translation table if XtNbaseTranslations
was not found.	This final table is then stored into the
widget 4mtranslations24m field.	 If the XtNtranslations resource
specified ``#replace'', no merge is done.  If neither
XtNbaseTranslations or XtNtranslations are specified, the
class translation table is copied into the widget instance.


To completely remove existing translations, use 4mXtUninstall-0m
4mTranslations24m.

__
|
void XtUninstallTranslations(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget from which the translations
	  are to be removed.   Must be of class Core or any
	  subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtUninstallTranslations24m function causes the entire
translation table for the widget to be removed.


1m10.4.	 Using Accelerators0m

It is often desirable to be able to bind events in one wid-
get to actions in another.  In particular, it is often use-
ful to be able to invoke menu actions from the keyboard.
The Intrinsics provide a facility, called accelerators, that
lets you accomplish this.  An accelerator table is a trans-
lation table that is bound with its actions in the context
of a particular widget, the 4msource24m widget.	 The accelerator
table can then be installed on one or more 4mdestination24m wid-
gets.  When an event sequence in the destination widget
would cause an accelerator action to be taken, and if the
source widget is sensitive, the actions are executed as
though triggered by the same event sequence in the accelera-
tor source widget.  The event is passed to the action



			     1m2750m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


procedure without modification.	 The action procedures used
within accelerators must not assume that the source widget
is realized nor that any fields of the event are in refer-
ence to the source widget's window if the widget is real-
ized.

Each widget instance contains that widget's exported accel-
erator table as a resource.  Each class of widget exports a
method that takes a displayable string representation of the
accelerators so that widgets can display their current
accelerators.  The representation is the accelerator table
in canonical translation table form (see Appendix B).  The
display_accelerator procedure pointer is of type 4mXtString-0m
4mProc24m.

__
|
typedef void (*XtStringProc)(Widget, String);
      Widget 4mw24m;
      String 4mstring24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the source widget that supplied the
	  accelerators.

4mstring24m    Specifies the string representation of the accel-
	  erators for this widget.
|__

Accelerators can be specified in resource files, and the
string representation is the same as for a translation ta-
ble.  However, the interpretation of the 4m#augment24m and 4m#over-0m
4mride24m directives applies to what will happen when the accel-
erator is installed; that is, whether or not the accelerator
translations will override the translations in the destina-
tion widget.  The default is 4m#augment24m, which means that the
accelerator translations have lower priority than the desti-
nation translations.  The 4m#replace24m directive is ignored for
accelerator tables.


To parse an accelerator table, use 4mXtParseAcceleratorTable24m.

__
|
XtAccelerators XtParseAcceleratorTable(4msource24m)
      String 4msource24m;


4msource24m    Specifies the accelerator table to compile.
|__

The 4mXtParseAcceleratorTable24m function compiles the accelera-
tor table into an opaque internal representation.  The



			     1m2760m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


client should set the XtNaccelerators resource of each wid-
get that is to be activated by these translations to the
returned value.


To install accelerators from a widget on another widget, use
4mXtInstallAccelerators24m.

__
|
void XtInstallAccelerators(4mdestination24m, 4msource24m)
      Widget 4mdestination24m;
      Widget 4msource24m;


4mdestination0m
	  Specifies the widget on which the accelerators are
	  to be installed.  Must be of class Core or any
	  subclass thereof.

4msource24m    Specifies the widget from which the accelerators
	  are to come.	Must be of class Core or any sub-
	  class thereof.
|__

The 4mXtInstallAccelerators24m function installs the 4maccelerators0m
resource value from 4msource24m onto 4mdestination24m by merging the
source accelerators into the destination translations.	If
the source 4mdisplay_accelerator24m field is non-NULL, 4mXtInstal-0m
4mlAccelerators24m calls it with the source widget and a string
representation of the accelerator table, which indicates
that its accelerators have been installed and that it should
display them appropriately.  The string representation of
the accelerator table is its canonical translation table
representation.


As a convenience for installing all accelerators from a wid-
get and all its descendants onto one destination, use 4mXtIn-0m
4mstallAllAccelerators24m.

















			     1m2770m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtInstallAllAccelerators(4mdestination24m, 4msource24m)
      Widget 4mdestination24m;
      Widget 4msource24m;


4mdestination0m
	  Specifies the widget on which the accelerators are
	  to be installed.  Must be of class Core or any
	  subclass thereof.

4msource24m    Specifies the root widget of the widget tree from
	  which the accelerators are to come.  Must be of
	  class Core or any subclass thereof.
|__

The 4mXtInstallAllAccelerators24m function recursively descends
the widget tree rooted at 4msource24m and installs the accelera-
tors resource value of each widget encountered onto 4mdestina-0m
4mtion24m.  A common use is to call 4mXtInstallAllAccelerators24m and
pass the application main window as the source.


1m10.5.	 KeyCode-to-KeySym Conversions0m

The translation manager provides support for automatically
translating KeyCodes in incoming key events into KeySyms.
KeyCode-to-KeySym translator procedure pointers are of type
4mXtKeyProc24m.




























			     1m2780m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtKeyProc)(Display*, KeyCode, Modifiers, Modifiers*, KeySym*);
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      KeyCode 4mkeycode24m;
      Modifiers 4mmodifiers24m;
      Modifiers *4mmodifiers_return24m;
      KeySym *4mkeysym_return24m;


4mdisplay24m	Specifies the display that the KeyCode is from.

4mkeycode24m	Specifies the KeyCode to translate.

4mmodifiers24m	Specifies the modifiers to the KeyCode.

4mmodifiers_return0m
	   Specifies a location in which to store a mask
	   that indicates the subset of all modifiers that
	   are examined by the key translator for the speci-
	   fied keycode.

4mkeysym_return0m
	   Specifies a location in which to store the
	   resulting KeySym.
|__

This procedure takes a KeyCode and modifiers and produces a
KeySym.	 For any given key translator function and keyboard
encoding, 4mmodifiers_return24m will be a constant per KeyCode
that indicates the subset of all modifiers that are examined
by the key translator for that KeyCode.

The KeyCode-to-KeySym translator procedure must be imple-
mented such that multiple calls with the same 4mdisplay24m, 4mkey-0m
4mcode24m, and 4mmodifiers24m return the same result until either a
new case converter, an 4mXtCaseProc24m, is installed or a 4mMap-0m
4mpingNotify24m event is received.



The Intrinsics maintain tables internally to map KeyCodes to
KeySyms for each open display.	Translator procedures and
other clients may share a single copy of this table to per-
form the same mapping.

To return a pointer to the KeySym-to-KeyCode mapping table
for a particular display, use 4mXtGetKeysymTable24m.










			     1m2790m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
KeySym *XtGetKeysymTable(4mdisplay24m, 4mmin_keycode_return24m, 4mkeysyms_per_keycode_return24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      KeyCode *4mmin_keycode_return24m;
      int *4mkeysyms_per_keycode_return24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display whose table is required.

4mmin_keycode_return0m
	  Returns the minimum KeyCode valid for the display.

4mkeysyms_per_keycode_return0m
	  Returns the number of KeySyms stored for each Key-
	  Code.
|__

4mXtGetKeysymTable24m returns a pointer to the Intrinsics' copy
of the server's KeyCode-to-KeySym table.  This table must
not be modified.  There are 4mkeysyms_per_keycode_return0m
KeySyms associated with each KeyCode, located in the table
with indices starting at index

	 (test_keycode - min_keycode_return) *
     keysyms_per_keycode_return

for KeyCode 4mtest_keycode24m.	Any entries that have no KeySyms
associated with them contain the value 4mNoSymbol24m.  Clients
should not cache the KeySym table but should call
4mXtGetKeysymTable24m each time the value is needed, as the table
may change prior to dispatching each event.

For more information on this table, see Section 12.7 in 4mXlib0m
4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.


To register a key translator, use 4mXtSetKeyTranslator24m.

__
|
void XtSetKeyTranslator(4mdisplay24m, 4mproc24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      XtKeyProc 4mproc24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display from which to translate the
	  events.

4mproc24m      Specifies the procedure to perform key transla-
	  tions.
|__

The 4mXtSetKeyTranslator24m function sets the specified procedure
as the current key translator.	The default translator is



			     1m2800m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtTranslateKey24m, an 4mXtKeyProc24m that uses the Shift, Lock, num-
lock, and group modifiers with the interpretations defined
in 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Section 5.  It is provided so
that new translators can call it to get default KeyCode-to-
KeySym translations and so that the default translator can
be reinstalled.


To invoke the currently registered KeyCode-to-KeySym trans-
lator, use 4mXtTranslateKeycode24m.

__
|
void XtTranslateKeycode(4mdisplay24m, 4mkeycode24m, 4mmodifiers24m, 4mmodifiers_return24m, 4mkeysym_return24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      KeyCode 4mkeycode24m;
      Modifiers 4mmodifiers24m;
      Modifiers *4mmodifiers_return24m;
      KeySym *4mkeysym_return24m;


4mdisplay24m	Specifies the display that the KeyCode is from.

4mkeycode24m	Specifies the KeyCode to translate.

4mmodifiers24m	Specifies the modifiers to the KeyCode.

4mmodifiers_return0m
	   Returns a mask that indicates the modifiers actu-
	   ally used to generate the KeySym.

4mkeysym_return0m
	   Returns the resulting KeySym.
|__

The 4mXtTranslateKeycode24m function passes the specified argu-
ments directly to the currently registered KeyCode-to-KeySym
translator.


To handle capitalization of nonstandard KeySyms, the Intrin-
sics allow clients to register case conversion routines.
Case converter procedure pointers are of type 4mXtCaseProc24m.














			     1m2810m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
typedef void (*XtCaseProc)(Display*, KeySym, KeySym*, KeySym*);
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      KeySym 4mkeysym24m;
      KeySym *4mlower_return24m;
      KeySym *4mupper_return24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection for which the
	  conversion is required.

4mkeysym24m    Specifies the KeySym to convert.

4mlower_return0m
	  Specifies a location into which to store the low-
	  ercase equivalent for the KeySym.

4mupper_return0m
	  Specifies a location into which to store the
	  uppercase equivalent for the KeySym.
|__

If there is no case distinction, this procedure should store
the KeySym into both return values.


To register a case converter, use 4mXtRegisterCaseConverter24m.

__
|
void XtRegisterCaseConverter(4mdisplay24m, 4mproc24m, 4mstart24m, 4mstop24m)
    Display *4mdisplay24m;
    XtCaseProc 4mproc24m;
    KeySym 4mstart24m;
    KeySym 4mstop24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display from which the key events
	  are to come.

4mproc24m      Specifies the 4mXtCaseProc24m to do the conversions.

4mstart24m     Specifies the first KeySym for which this con-
	  verter is valid.

4mstop24m      Specifies the last KeySym for which this converter
	  is valid.
|__

The 4mXtRegisterCaseConverter24m registers the specified case
converter.  The 4mstart24m and 4mstop24m arguments provide the inclu-
sive range of KeySyms for which this converter is to be
called.	 The new converter overrides any previous converters
for KeySyms in that range.  No interface exists to remove



			     1m2820m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


converters; you need to register an identity converter.
When a new converter is registered, the Intrinsics  refresh
the keyboard state if necessary.  The default converter
understands case conversion for all Latin KeySyms defined in
4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Appendix A.


To determine uppercase and lowercase equivalents for a
KeySym, use 4mXtConvertCase24m.

__
|
void XtConvertCase(4mdisplay24m, 4mkeysym24m, 4mlower_return24m, 4mupper_return24m)
    Display *4mdisplay24m;
    KeySym 4mkeysym24m;
    KeySym *4mlower_return24m;
    KeySym *4mupper_return24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display that the KeySym came from.

4mkeysym24m    Specifies the KeySym to convert.

4mlower_return0m
	  Returns the lowercase equivalent of the KeySym.

4mupper_return0m
	  Returns the uppercase equivalent of the KeySym.
|__

The 4mXtConvertCase24m function calls the appropriate converter
and returns the results.  A user-supplied 4mXtKeyProc24m may need
to use this function.


1m10.6.	 Obtaining a KeySym in an Action Procedure0m

When an action procedure is invoked on a 4mKeyPress24m or 4mKeyRe-0m
4mlease24m event, it often has a need to retrieve the KeySym and
modifiers corresponding to the event that caused it to be
invoked.  In order to avoid repeating the processing that
was just performed by the Intrinsics to match the transla-
tion entry, the KeySym and modifiers are stored for the
duration of the action procedure and are made available to
the client.

To retrieve the KeySym and modifiers that matched the final
event specification in the translation table entry, use
4mXtGetActionKeysym24m.








			     1m2830m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
KeySym XtGetActionKeysym(4mevent24m, 4mmodifiers_return24m)
      XEvent *4mevent24m;
      Modifiers *4mmodifiers_return24m;


4mevent24m	 Specifies the event pointer passed to the action
	    procedure by the Intrinsics.

4mmodifiers_return0m
	    Returns the modifiers that caused the match, if
	    non-NULL.
|__

If 4mXtGetActionKeysym24m is called after an action procedure has
been invoked by the Intrinsics and before that action proce-
dure returns, and if the event pointer has the same value as
the event pointer passed to that action routine, and if the
event is a 4mKeyPress24m or 4mKeyRelease24m event, then 4mXtGetAction-0m
4mKeysym24m returns the KeySym that matched the final event spec-
ification in the translation table and, if 4mmodifiers_return0m
is non-NULL, the modifier state actually used to generate
this KeySym; otherwise, if the event is a 4mKeyPress24m or 4mKeyRe-0m
4mlease24m event, then 4mXtGetActionKeysym24m calls 4mXtTranslateKeycode0m
and returns the results; else it returns 4mNoSymbol24m and does
not examine 4mmodifiers_return24m.

Note that if an action procedure invoked by the Intrinsics
invokes a subsequent action procedure (and so on) via
4mXtCallActionProc24m, the nested action procedure may also call
4mXtGetActionKeysym24m to retrieve the Intrinsics' KeySym and
modifiers.


1m10.7.	 KeySym-to-KeyCode Conversions0m

To return the list of KeyCodes that map to a particular
KeySym in the keyboard mapping table maintained by the
Intrinsics, use 4mXtKeysymToKeycodeList24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtKeysymToKeycodeList(4mdisplay24m, 4mkeysym24m, 4mkeycodes_return24m, 4mkeycount_return24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      KeySym 4mkeysym24m;
      KeyCode **4mkeycodes_return24m;
      Cardinal *4mkeycount_return24m;


4mdisplay24m	 Specifies the display whose table is required.

4mkeysym24m	 Specifies the KeySym for which to search.

4mkeycodes_return0m
	    Returns a list of KeyCodes that have 4mkeysym0m
	    associated with them, or NULL if 4mkeycount_return0m
	    is 0.

4mkeycount_return0m
	    Returns the number of KeyCodes in the keycode
	    list.
|__

The 4mXtKeysymToKeycodeList24m procedure returns all the KeyCodes
that have 4mkeysym24m in their entry for the keyboard mapping ta-
ble associated with 4mdisplay24m.  For each entry in the table,
the first four KeySyms (groups 1 and 2) are interpreted as
specified by 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Section 5.  If no
KeyCodes map to the specified KeySym, 4mkeycount_return24m is
zero and *4mkeycodes_return24m is NULL.

The caller should free the storage pointed to by 4mkey-0m
4mcodes_return24m using 4mXtFree24m when it is no longer useful.  If
the caller needs to examine the KeyCode-to-KeySym table for
a particular KeyCode, it should call 4mXtGetKeysymTable24m.


1m10.8.	 Registering Button and Key Grabs for Actions0m

To register button and key grabs for a widget's window
according to the event bindings in the widget's translation
table, use 4mXtRegisterGrabAction24m.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtRegisterGrabAction(4maction_proc24m, 4mowner_events24m, 4mevent_mask24m, 4mpointer_mode24m, 4mkeyboard_mode24m)
      XtActionProc 4maction_proc24m;
      Boolean 4mowner_events24m;
      unsigned int 4mevent_mask24m;
      int 4mpointer_mode24m, 4mkeyboard_mode24m;


4maction_proc0m
	  Specifies the action procedure to search for in
	  translation tables.


4mowner_events0m
4mevent_mask0m
4mpointer_mode0m
4mkeyboard_mode0m
	  Specify arguments to 4mXtGrabButton24m or 4mXtGrabKey24m.
|__

4mXtRegisterGrabAction24m adds the specified 4maction_proc24m to a
list known to the translation manager.	When a widget is
realized, or when the translations of a realized widget or
the accelerators installed on a realized widget are modi-
fied, its translation table and any installed accelerators
are scanned for action procedures on this list.	 If any are
invoked on 4mButtonPress24m or 4mKeyPress24m events as the only or
final event in a sequence, the Intrinsics will call 4mXtGrab-0m
4mButton24m or 4mXtGrabKey24m for the widget with every button or Key-
Code which maps to the event detail field, passing the spec-
ified 4mowner_events24m, 4mevent_mask24m, 4mpointer_mode24m, and 4mkey-0m
4mboard_mode24m.  For 4mButtonPress24m events, the modifiers specified
in the grab are determined directly from the translation
specification and 4mconfine_to24m and 4mcursor24m are specified as
4mNone24m.  For 4mKeyPress24m events, if the translation table entry
specifies colon (:) in the modifier list, the modifiers are
determined by calling the key translator procedure regis-
tered for the display and calling 4mXtGrabKey24m for every combi-
nation of standard modifiers which map the KeyCode to the
specified event detail KeySym, and ORing any modifiers spec-
ified in the translation table entry, and 4mevent_mask24m is
ignored.  If the translation table entry does not specify
colon in the modifier list, the modifiers specified in the
grab are those specified in the translation table entry
only.  For both 4mButtonPress24m and 4mKeyPress24m events, don't-care
modifiers are ignored unless the translation entry explic-
itly specifies ``Any'' in the 4mmodifiers24m field.

If the specified 4maction_proc24m is already registered for the
calling process, the new values will replace the previously
specified values for any widgets that become realized fol-
lowing the call, but existing grabs are not altered on cur-
rently realized widgets.




			     1m2860m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


When translations or installed accelerators are modified for
a realized widget, any previous key or button grabs regis-
tered as a result of the old bindings are released if they
do not appear in the new bindings and are not explicitly
grabbed by the client with 4mXtGrabKey24m or 4mXtGrabButton24m.


1m10.9.	 Invoking Actions Directly0m

Normally action procedures are invoked by the Intrinsics
when an event or event sequence arrives for a widget. To
invoke an action procedure directly, without generating (or
synthesizing) events, use 4mXtCallActionProc24m.

__
|
void XtCallActionProc(4mwidget24m, 4maction24m, 4mevent24m, 4mparams24m, 4mnum_params24m)
      Widget 4mwidget24m;
      String 4maction24m;
      XEvent *4mevent24m;
      String *4mparams24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum_params24m;


4mwidget24m    Specifies the widget in which the action is to be
	  invoked.  Must be of class Core or any subclass
	  thereof.

4maction24m    Specifies the name of the action routine.

4mevent24m     Specifies the contents of the 4mevent24m passed to the
	  action routine.

4mparams24m    Specifies the contents of the 4mparams24m passed to the
	  action routine.

4mnum_params0m
	  Specifies the number of entries in 4mparams24m.
|__

4mXtCallActionProc24m searches for the named action routine in
the same manner and order as translation tables are bound,
as described in Section 10.1.2, except that application
action tables are searched, if necessary, as of the time of
the call to 4mXtCallActionProc24m.  If found, the action routine
is invoked with the specified widget, event pointer, and
parameters.  It is the responsibility of the caller to
ensure that the contents of the 4mevent24m, 4mparams24m, and
4mnum_params24m arguments are appropriate for the specified
action routine and, if necessary, that the specified widget
is realized or sensitive.  If the named action routine can-
not be found, 4mXtCallActionProc24m generates a warning message
and returns.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m10.10.  Obtaining a Widget's Action List0m

Occasionally a subclass will require the pointers to one or
more of its superclass's action procedures.  This would be
needed, for example, in order to envelop the superclass's
action.	 To retrieve the list of action procedures regis-
tered in the superclass's 4mactions24m field, use 4mXtGetAction-0m
4mList24m.

__
|
void XtGetActionList(4mwidget_class24m, 4mactions_return24m, 4mnum_actions_return24m)
      WidgetClass 4mwidget_class24m;
      XtActionList *4mactions_return24m;
      Cardinal *4mnum_actions_return24m;


4mwidget_class24m   Specifies the widget class whose actions are
	       to be returned.

4mactions_return24m Returns the action list.

4mnum_actions_return0m
	       Returns the number of action procedures
	       declared by the class.
|__

4mXtGetActionList24m returns the action table defined by the
specified widget class.	 This table does not include actions
defined by the superclasses.  If 4mwidget_class24m is not ini-
tialized, or is not 4mcoreWidgetClass24m or a subclass thereof,
or if the class does not define any actions, *4mactions_return0m
will be NULL and *4mnum_actions_return24m will be zero.	 If
*4mactions_return24m is non-NULL the client is responsible for
freeing the table using 4mXtFree24m when it is no longer needed.

		     1mUtility Functions0m



The Intrinsics provide a number of utility functions that
you can use to

    Determine the number of elements in an array.

    Translate strings to widget instances.

    Manage memory usage.

    Share graphics contexts.

    Manipulate selections.

    Merge exposure events into a region.

    Translate widget coordinates.

    Locate a widget given a window id.

    Handle errors.

    Set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.

    Locate files by name with string substitutions.

    Register callback functions for external agents.

    Locate all the displays of an application context.


1m11.1.	 Determining the Number of Elements in an Array0m

To determine the number of elements in a fixed-size array,
use 4mXtNumber24m.

__
|
Cardinal XtNumber(4marray24m)
      4mArrayType24m 4marray24m;


4marray24m     Specifies a fixed-size array of arbitrary type.
|__

The 4mXtNumber24m macro returns the number of elements allocated
to the array.



			     1m2890m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m11.2.	 Translating Strings to Widget Instances0m

To translate a widget name to a widget instance, use 4mXtName-0m
4mToWidget24m.

__
|
Widget XtNameToWidget(4mreference24m, 4mnames24m)
      Widget 4mreference24m;
      String 4mnames24m;


4mreference24m Specifies the widget from which the search is to
	  start.  Must be of class Core or any subclass
	  thereof.

4mnames24m     Specifies the partially qualified name of the
	  desired widget.
|__

The 4mXtNameToWidget24m function searches for a descendant of the
4mreference24m widget whose name matches the specified names.
The 4mnames24m parameter specifies a simple object name or a
series of simple object name components separated by periods
or asterisks.  4mXtNameToWidget24m returns the descendant with
the shortest name matching the specification according to
the following rules, where child is either a pop-up child or
a normal child if the widget's class is a subclass of Com-
posite :

    Enumerate the object subtree rooted at the reference
     widget in breadth-first order, qualifying the name of
     each object with the names of all its ancestors up to,
     but not including, the reference widget.  The ordering
     between children of a common parent is not defined.

    Return the first object in the enumeration that matches
     the specified name, where each component of 4mnames0m
     matches exactly the corresponding component of the
     qualified object name and asterisk matches any series
     of components, including none.

    If no match is found, return NULL.

Since breadth-first traversal is specified, the descendant
with the shortest matching name (i.e., the fewest number of
components), if any, will always be returned.  However,
since the order of enumeration of children is undefined and
since the Intrinsics do not require that all children of a
widget have unique names, 4mXtNameToWidget24m may return any
child that matches if there are multiple objects in the sub-
tree with the same name.  Consecutive separators (periods or
asterisks) including at least one asterisk are treated as a
single asterisk.  Consecutive periods are treated as a



			     1m2900m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


single period.


1m11.3.	 Managing Memory Usage0m

The Intrinsics memory management functions provide uniform
checking for null pointers and error reporting on memory
allocation errors.  These functions are completely compati-
ble with their standard C language runtime counterparts 4mmal-0m
4mloc24m, 4mcalloc24m, 4mrealloc24m, and 4mfree24m with the following added
functionality:

    4mXtMalloc24m, 4mXtCalloc24m, and 4mXtRealloc24m give an error if
     there is not enough memory.

    4mXtFree24m simply returns if passed a NULL pointer.

    4mXtRealloc24m simply allocates new storage if passed a NULL
     pointer.

See the standard C library documentation on 4mmalloc24m, 4mcalloc24m,
4mrealloc24m, and 4mfree24m for more information.


To allocate storage, use 4mXtMalloc24m.

__
|
char *XtMalloc(4msize24m)
      Cardinal 4msize24m;


4msize24m      Specifies the number of bytes desired.
|__

The 4mXtMalloc24m function returns a pointer to a block of stor-
age of at least the specified 4msize24m bytes.	If there is
insufficient memory to allocate the new block, 4mXtMalloc0m
calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.


To allocate and initialize an array, use 4mXtCalloc24m.















			     1m2910m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
char *XtCalloc(4mnum24m, 4msize24m)
      Cardinal 4mnum24m;
      Cardinal 4msize24m;


4mnum24m       Specifies the number of array elements to allo-
	  cate.

4msize24m      Specifies the size of each array element in bytes.
|__

The 4mXtCalloc24m function allocates space for the specified num-
ber of array elements of the specified size and initializes
the space to zero.  If there is insufficient memory to allo-
cate the new block, 4mXtCalloc24m calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.  4mXtCalloc0m
returns the address of the allocated storage.


To change the size of an allocated block of storage, use
4mXtRealloc24m.

__
|
char *XtRealloc(4mptr24m, 4mnum24m)
      char *4mptr24m;
      Cardinal 4mnum24m;


4mptr24m       Specifies a pointer to the old storage allocated
	  with 4mXtMalloc24m, 4mXtCalloc24m, or 4mXtRealloc24m, or NULL.

4mnum24m       Specifies number of bytes desired in new storage.
|__

The 4mXtRealloc24m function changes the size of a block of stor-
age, possibly moving it.  Then it copies the old contents
(or as much as will fit) into the new block and frees the
old block.  If there is insufficient memory to allocate the
new block, 4mXtRealloc24m calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.  If 4mptr24m is NULL,
4mXtRealloc24m simply calls 4mXtMalloc24m.  4mXtRealloc24m then returns the
address of the new block.


To free an allocated block of storage, use 4mXtFree24m.












			     1m2920m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtFree(4mptr24m)
      char *4mptr24m;


4mptr24m       Specifies a pointer to a block of storage allo-
	  cated with 4mXtMalloc24m, 4mXtCalloc24m, or 4mXtRealloc24m, or
	  NULL.
|__

The 4mXtFree24m function returns storage, allowing it to be
reused.	 If 4mptr24m is NULL, 4mXtFree24m returns immediately.


To allocate storage for a new instance of a type, use 4mXtNew24m.

__
|
4mtype24m *XtNew(4mtype24m)
      4mtype24m 4mt24m;


4mtype24m      Specifies a previously declared type.
|__

4mXtNew24m returns a pointer to the allocated storage.	If there
is insufficient memory to allocate the new block, 4mXtNew0m
calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.	4mXtNew24m is a convenience macro that calls
4mXtMalloc24m with the following arguments specified:


     ((type *) XtMalloc((unsigned) sizeof(type)))


The storage allocated by 4mXtNew24m should be freed using 4mXtFree24m.


To copy an instance of a string, use 4mXtNewString24m.

__
|
String XtNewString(4mstring24m)
      String 4mstring24m;


4mstring24m    Specifies a previously declared string.
|__

4mXtNewString24m returns a pointer to the allocated storage.  If
there is insufficient memory to allocate the new block,
4mXtNewString24m calls 4mXtErrorMsg24m.	 4mXtNewString24m is a convenience
macro that calls 4mXtMalloc24m with the following arguments spec-
ified:




			     1m2930m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


     (strcpy(XtMalloc((unsigned)strlen(str) + 1), str))


The storage allocated by 4mXtNewString24m should be freed using
4mXtFree24m.


1m11.4.	 Sharing Graphics Contexts0m

The Intrinsics provide a mechanism whereby cooperating
objects can share a graphics context (GC), thereby reducing
both the number of GCs created and the total number of
server calls in any given application.	The mechanism is a
simple caching scheme and allows for clients to declare both
modifiable and nonmodifiable fields of the shared GCs.

To obtain a shareable GC with modifiable fields, use 4mXtAllo-0m
4mcateGC24m.

__
|
GC XtAllocateGC(4mwidget24m, 4mdepth24m, 4mvalue_mask24m, 4mvalues24m, 4mdynamic_mask24m, 4munused_mask24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;
      Cardinal 4mdepth24m;
      XtGCMask 4mvalue_mask24m;
      XGCValues *4mvalues24m;
      XtGCMask 4mdynamic_mask24m;
      XtGCMask 4munused_mask24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies an object, giving the screen for which
	  the returned GC is valid.  Must be of class Object
	  or any subclass thereof.

4mdepth24m     Specifies the depth for which the returned GC is
	  valid, or 0.

4mvalue_mask0m
	  Specifies fields of the GC that are initialized
	  from 4mvalues24m.

4mvalues24m    Specifies the values for the initialized fields.

4mdynamic_mask0m
	  Specifies fields of the GC that will be modified
	  by the caller.

4munused_mask0m
	  Specifies fields of the GC that will not be needed
	  by the caller.
|__

The 4mXtAllocateGC24m function returns a shareable GC that may be
modified by the client.	 The 4mscreen24m field of the specified



			     1m2940m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


widget or of the nearest widget ancestor of the specified
object and the specified 4mdepth24m argument supply the root and
drawable depths for which the GC is to be valid.  If 4mdepth0m
is zero, the depth is taken from the 4mdepth24m field of the
specified widget or of the nearest widget ancestor of the
specified object.

The 4mvalue_mask24m argument specifies fields of the GC that are
initialized with the respective member of the 4mvalues24m struc-
ture.  The 4mdynamic_mask24m argument specifies fields that the
caller intends to modify during program execution.  The
caller must ensure that the corresponding GC field is set
prior to each use of the GC.  The 4munused_mask24m argument spec-
ifies fields of the GC that are of no interest to the
caller.	 The caller may make no assumptions about the con-
tents of any fields specified in 4munused_mask24m.  The caller
may assume that at all times all fields not specified in
either 4mdynamic_mask24m or 4munused_mask24m have their default value
if not specified in 4mvalue_mask24m or the value specified by
4mvalues24m.  If a field is specified in both 4mvalue_mask24m and
4mdynamic_mask24m, the effect is as if it were specified only in
4mdynamic_mask24m and then immediately set to the value in 4mval-0m
4mues24m.  If a field is set in 4munused_mask24m and also in either
4mvalue_mask24m or 4mdynamic_mask24m, the specification in 4munused_mask0m
is ignored.

4mXtAllocateGC24m tries to minimize the number of unique GCs cre-
ated by comparing the arguments with those of previous calls
and returning an existing GC when there are no conflicts.
4mXtAllocateGC24m may modify and return an existing GC if it was
allocated with a nonzero 4munused_mask24m.


To obtain a shareable GC with no modifiable fields, use
4mXtGetGC24m.






















			     1m2950m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
GC XtGetGC(4mobject24m, 4mvalue_mask24m, 4mvalues24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;
      XtGCMask 4mvalue_mask24m;
      XGCValues *4mvalues24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies an object, giving the screen and depth
	  for which the returned GC is valid.  Must be of
	  class Object or any subclass thereof.

4mvalue_mask0m
	  Specifies which fields of the 4mvalues24m structure are
	  specified.

4mvalues24m    Specifies the actual values for this GC.
|__

The 4mXtGetGC24m function returns a shareable, read-only GC.  The
parameters to this function are the same as those for 4mXCre-0m
4mateGC24m except that an Object is passed instead of a Display.
4mXtGetGC24m is equivalent to 4mXtAllocateGC24m with 4mdepth24m,
4mdynamic_mask24m, and 4munused_mask24m all zero.

4mXtGetGC24m shares only GCs in which all values in the GC
returned by 4mXCreateGC24m are the same.  In particular, it does
not use the 4mvalue_mask24m provided to determine which fields of
the GC a widget considers relevant.  The 4mvalue_mask24m is used
only to tell the server which fields should be filled in
from 4mvalues24m and which it should fill in with default values.


To deallocate a shared GC when it is no longer needed, use
4mXtReleaseGC24m.

__
|
void XtReleaseGC(4mobject24m, 4mgc24m)
      Widget 4mobject24m;
      GC 4mgc24m;


4mobject24m    Specifies any object on the Display for which the
	  GC was created.  Must be of class Object or any
	  subclass thereof.

4mgc24m	       Specifies the shared GC obtained with either 4mXtAl-0m
	  4mlocateGC24m or 4mXtGetGC24m.
|__

References to shareable GCs are counted and a free request
is generated to the server when the last user of a given GC
releases it.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m11.5.	 Managing Selections0m

Arbitrary widgets in multiple applications can communicate
with each other by means of the Intrinsics global selection
mechanism, which conforms to the specifications in the
4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m.  The Intrin-
sics supply functions for providing and receiving selection
data in one logical piece (atomic transfers) or in smaller
logical segments (incremental transfers).

The incremental interface is provided for a selection owner
or selection requestor that cannot or prefers not to pass
the selection value to and from the Intrinsics in a single
call.  For instance, either an application that is running
on a machine with limited memory may not be able to store
the entire selection value in memory or a selection owner
may already have the selection value available in discrete
chunks, and it would be more efficient not to have to allo-
cate additional storage to copy the pieces contiguously.
Any owner or requestor that prefers to deal with the selec-
tion value in segments can use the incremental interfaces to
do so.	The transfer between the selection owner or
requestor and the Intrinsics is not required to match the
underlying transport protocol between the application and
the X server; the Intrinsics will break too large a selec-
tion into smaller pieces for transport if necessary and will
coalesce a selection transmitted incrementally if the value
was requested atomically.


1m11.5.1.  Setting and Getting the Selection Timeout Value0m

To set the Intrinsics selection timeout, use 4mXtAppSetSelec-0m
4mtionTimeout24m.

__
|
void XtAppSetSelectionTimeout(4mapp_context24m, 4mtimeout24m)
    XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;
    unsigned long 4mtimeout24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.

4mtimeo24m|4m24m__  Specifies the selection timeout in milliseconds.


To get the current selection timeout value, use 4mXtAppGetSe-0m
4mlectionTimeout24m.







			     1m2970m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
unsigned long XtAppGetSelectionTimeout(4mapp_context24m)
     XtAppContext 4mapp_context24m;


4mapp_context0m
	  Specifies the application context.
|__

The 4mXtAppGetSelectionTimeout24m function returns the current
selection timeout value in milliseconds.  The selection
timeout is the time within which the two communicating
applications must respond to one another.  The initial time-
out value is set by the selectionTimeout application
resource as retrieved by 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m.  If selection-
Timeout is not specified, the default is five seconds.


1m11.5.2.  Using Atomic Transfers0m

When using atomic transfers, the owner will completely
process one selection request at a time.  The owner may con-

1m11.5.2.1.  Atomic Transfer Procedures0m

The following procedures are used by the selection owner

The procedure pointer specified by the owner to supply the
selection data to the Intrinsics is of type 4mXtConvertSelec-0m
4mtionProc24m.

    XtPointer *4mvalue_return24m;
    unsigned long *4mlength_return24m;
    int *4mformat_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that currently owns this
	  selection.

4mselection24m Specifies the atom naming the selection requested
	  (for example, 4mXA_PRIMARY24m or 4mXA_SECONDARY24m).

4mtarget24m    Specifies the target type of the selection that
	  has been requested, which indicates the desired
	  information about the selection (for example, File
	  Name, Text, Window).

4mtype_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer to an atom into which the
	  property type of the converted value of the selec-
	  tion is to be stored.	 For instance, either File
	  Name or Text might have property type 4mXA_STRING24m.

4mvalue_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which a pointer to the
	  converted value of the selection is to be stored.
	  The selection owner is responsible for allocating
	  this storage.	 If the selection owner has provided
	  an 4mXtSelectionDoneProc24m for the selection, this
	  storage is owned by the selection owner; other-
	  wise, it is owned by the Intrinsics selection
	  mechanism, which frees it by calling 4mXtFree24m when
	  it is done with it.

4mlength_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which the number of ele-
	  ments in 4mvalue_return24m, each of size indicated by
	  4mformat_return24m, is to be stored.

4mformat_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which the size in bits of
	  the data elements of the selection value is to be
	  stored.
|__

This procedure is called by the Intrinsics selection mecha-
nism to get the value of a selection as a given type from
the current selection owner.  It returns 4mTrue24m if the owner



			     1m2990m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


successfully converted the selection to the target type or
4mFalse24m otherwise.  If the procedure returns 4mFalse24m, the values
of the return arguments are undefined.	Each 4mXtConvertSelec-0m
4mtionProc24m should respond to target value 4mTARGETS24m by returning
a value containing the list of the targets into which it is
prepared to convert the selection.  The value returned in
4mformat_return24m must be one of 8, 16, or 32 to allow the
server to byte-swap the data if necessary.

This procedure does not need to worry about responding to
the MULTIPLE or the TIMESTAMP target values (see Section
2.6.2 in the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m).
A selection request with the MULTIPLE target type is trans-
parently transformed into a series of calls to this proce-
dure, one for each target type, and a selection request with
the TIMESTAMP target value is answered automatically by the
Intrinsics using the time specified in the call to 4mXtOwnSe-0m
4mlection24m or 4mXtOwnSelectionIncremental24m.


To retrieve the 4mSelectionRequest24m event that triggered the
4mXtConvertSelectionProc24m procedure, use 4mXtGetSelectionRequest24m.

4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that currently owns this
	  selection.  Must be of class Core or any subclass
	  thereof.

4mselection24m Specifies the selection being processed.

4mrequest_id0m
	  Specifies the requestor id in the case of incre-
	  mental selections, or NULL in the case of atomic
	  transfers.
|__

4mXtGetSelectionRequest24m may be called only from within an
4mXtConvertSelectionProc24m procedure and returns a pointer to
the 4mSelectionRequest24m event that caused the conversion proce-
dure to be invoked.  4mRequest_id24m specifies a unique id for
the individual request in the case that multiple incremental
transfers are outstanding.  For atomic transfers, 4mrequest_id0m
must be specified as NULL.  If no 4mSelectionRequest24m event is
being processed for the specified 4mwidget24m, 4mselection24m, and
4mrequest_id24m, 4mXtGetSelectionRequest24m returns NULL.

4mtarget24m    Specifies the target type to which the conversion
	  was done.

This procedure is called by the Intrinsics selection mecha-
nism to inform the selection owner that a selection
requestor has successfully retrieved a selection value.	 If
the selection owner has registered an 4mXtSelectionDoneProc24m,
it should expect it to be called once for each conversion
that it performs, after the converted value has been suc-
cessfully transferred to the requestor.	 If the selection
owner has registered an 4mXtSelectionDoneProc24m, it also owns

4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that requested the selection
	  value.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies a value passed in by the widget when it
	  requested the selection.

4mselection24m Specifies the name of the selection that was
	  requested.

4mtype24m      Specifies the representation type of the selection
	  value (for example, 4mXA_STRING24m).	Note that it is
	  not the target that was requested (which the
	  client must remember for itself), but the type
	  that is used to represent the target.	 The special
	  symbolic constant 4mXT_CONVERT_FAIL24m is used to indi-
	  cate that the selection conversion failed because
	  the selection owner did not respond within the
	  Intrinsics selection timeout interval.

4mvalue24m     Specifies a pointer to the selection value.  The
	  requesting client owns this storage and is respon-
	  sible for freeing it by calling 4mXtFree24m when it is
	  done with it.

4mlength24m    Specifies the number of elements in 4mvalue24m.

4mformat24m    Specifies the size in bits of the data in each
	  element of 4mvalue24m.

This procedure is called by the Intrinsics selection mecha-
nism to deliver the requested selection to the requestor.

If the 4mSelectionNotify24m event returns a property of 4mNone24m,
meaning the conversion has been refused because there is no
owner for the specified selection or the owner cannot con-
vert the selection to the requested target for any reason,
the procedure is called with a value of NULL and a length of
zero.


To obtain the selection value in a single logical unit, use
4mXtGetSelectionValue24m or 4mXtGetSelectionValues24m.

4mselection24m Specifies the particular selection desired; for
	  example, 4mXA_PRIMARY24m.

4mtarget24m    Specifies the type of information needed about the
	  selection.

4mcallback24m  Specifies the procedure to be called when the

	  is how the selection value is communicated back to
	  the client.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies additional data to be passed to the
	  specified procedure when it is called.

4mtime24m      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the

The 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m function requests the value of the
selection converted to the target type.	 The specified call-
back is called at some time after 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m is
called, when the selection value is received from the X
server.	 It may be called before or after 4mXtGetSelectionVa-0m
4mlue24m returns.  For more information about 4mselection24m, 4mtarget24m,

	  is, primary or secondary).

4mtargets24m   Specifies the types of information needed about
	  the selection.

4mcount24m     Specifies the length of the 4mtargets24m and
	  4mclient_data24m lists.

4mcallback24m  Specifies the callback procedure to be called with
	  each selection value obtained.  Note that this is
	  how the selection values are communicated back to
	  the client.

4mclient_data0m
	  Specifies a list of additional data values, one
	  for each target type, that are passed to the call-
	  back procedure when it is called for that target.

4mtime24m      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
	  selection request was initiated.  This should be
	  the timestamp of the event that triggered this
	  request; the value 4mCurrentTime24m is not acceptable.
|__

The 4mXtGetSelectionValues24m function is similar to multiple
calls to 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m except that it guarantees that
no other client can assert ownership between requests and
therefore that all the conversions will refer to the same
selection value.  The callback is invoked once for each tar-
get value with the corresponding client data.  For more
information about 4mselection24m, 4mtarget24m, and 4mtime24m, see Section

4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that wishes to become the
	  owner.  Must be of class Core or any subclass
	  thereof.

4mselection24m Specifies the name of the selection (for example,
	  4mXA_PRIMARY24m).

4mtime24m      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
	  ownership request was initiated.  This should be
	  the timestamp of the event that triggered owner-
	  ship; the value 4mCurrentTime24m is not acceptable.

4mconvert_proc0m
	  Specifies the procedure to be called whenever a
	  client requests the current value of the selec-
	  tion.

4mlose_selection0m
	  Specifies the procedure to be called whenever the
	  widget has lost selection ownership, or NULL if
	  the owner is not interested in being called back.

4mdone_proc24m Specifies the procedure called after the requestor
	  has received the selection value, or NULL if the
	  owner is not interested in being called back.
|__

The 4mXtOwnSelection24m function informs the Intrinsics selection
mechanism that a widget wishes to own a selection.  It
returns 4mTrue24m if the widget successfully becomes the owner
and 4mFalse24m otherwise.  The widget may fail to become the
owner if some other widget has asserted ownership at a time
later than this widget.	 The widget can lose selection own-
ership either because some other widget asserted later own-
ership of the selection or because the widget voluntarily
gave up ownership of the selection.  The lose_selection pro-
cedure is not called if the widget fails to obtain selection
ownership in the first place.

If a done_proc is specified, the client owns the storage
allocated for passing the value to the Intrinsics.  If
4mdone_proc24m is NULL, the convert_proc must allocate storage
using 4mXtMalloc24m, 4mXtRealloc24m, or 4mXtCalloc24m, and the value speci-
fied is freed by the Intrinsics when the transfer is

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


complete.


Usually, a selection owner maintains ownership indefinitely
until some other widget requests ownership, at which time
the Intrinsics selection mechanism informs the previous
owner that it has lost ownership of the selection.  However,
in response to some user actions (for example, when a user
deletes the information selected), the application may wish
to explicitly inform the Intrinsics by using 4mXtDisownSelec-0m
4mtion24m that it no longer is to be the selection owner.

__
|
void XtDisownSelection(4mw24m, 4mselection24m, 4mtime24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Atom 4mselection24m;
      Time 4mtime24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget that wishes to relinquish
	  ownership.

4mselection24m Specifies the atom naming the selection being
	  given up.

4mtime24m      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
	  request to relinquish selection ownership was ini-
	  tiated.
|__

The 4mXtDisownSelection24m function informs the Intrinsics selec-
tion mechanism that the specified widget is to lose owner-
ship of the selection.	If the widget does not currently own
the selection, either because it lost the selection or
because it never had the selection to begin with, 4mXtDisownS-0m
4melection24m does nothing.

After a widget has called 4mXtDisownSelection24m, its convert
procedure is not called even if a request arrives later with
a timestamp during the period that this widget owned the
selection.  However, its done procedure is called if a con-
version that started before the call to 4mXtDisownSelection0m
finishes after the call to 4mXtDisownSelection24m.


1m11.5.3.  Using Incremental Transfers0m

When using the incremental interface, an owner may have to
process more than one selection request for the same selec-
tion, converted to the same target, at the same time.  The
incremental functions take a 4mrequest_id24m argument, which is
an identifier that is guaranteed to be unique among all
incremental requests that are active concurrently.



			     1m3060m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


For example, consider the following:

    Upon receiving a request for the selection value, the
     owner sends the first segment.

    While waiting to be called to provide the next segment
     value but before sending it, the owner receives another
     request from a different requestor for the same selec-
     tion value.

    To distinguish between the requests, the owner uses the
     request_id value.	This allows the owner to distinguish
     between the first requestor, which is asking for the
     second segment, and the second requestor, which is ask-
     ing for the first segment.


1m11.5.3.1.  Incremental Transfer Procedures0m

The following procedures are used by selection owners who
wish to provide the selection data in multiple segments.

The procedure pointer specified by the incremental owner to

This procedure is called repeatedly by the Intrinsics selec-
tion mechanism to get the next incremental chunk of data
from a selection owner who has called 4mXtOwnSelectionIncre-0m
4mmental24m.  It must return 4mTrue24m if the procedure has succeeded
in converting the selection data or 4mFalse24m otherwise.  On the
first call with a particular request id, the owner must
begin a new incremental transfer for the requested selection
and target.  On subsequent calls with the same request id,
the owner may assume that the previously supplied value is
no longer needed by the Intrinsics; that is, a fixed trans-
fer area may be allocated and returned in 4mvalue_return24m for
each segment to be transferred.	 This procedure should store
a non-NULL value in 4mvalue_return24m and zero in 4mlength_return0m
to indicate that the entire selection has been delivered.
After returning this final segment, the request id may be
reused by the Intrinsics to begin a new transfer.

|__

The 4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m function is similar to
4mXtGetSelectionValue24m except that the selection_callback pro-
cedure will be called repeatedly upon delivery of multiple
segments of the selection value.  The end of the selection
value is indicated when 4mselection_callback24m is called with a
non-NULL value of length zero, which must still be freed by
the client.  If the transfer of the selection is aborted in
the middle of a transfer (for example, because of a time-
out), the selection_callback procedure is called with a type
value equal to the symbolic constant 4mXT_CONVERT_FAIL24m so that
the requestor can dispose of the partial selection value it
has collected up until that point.  Upon receiving 4mXT_CON-0m
4mVERT_FAIL24m, the requesting client must determine for itself
whether or not a partially completed data transfer is mean-
ingful.	 For more information about 4mselection24m, 4mtarget24m, and
4mtime24m, see Section 2.6 in the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mCon-0m

The 4mXtGetSelectionValuesIncremental24m function is similar to

is equivalent to calling 4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m suc-
cessively for each 4mtarget/client_data24m pair except that
4mXtGetSelectionValuesIncremental24m does guarantee that all the

	    if the owner is not interested in being noti-
	    fied.

4mdone_callback0m
	    Specifies the procedure called after the

	    NULL if the owner is not interested in being
	    notified.

4mcancel_callback0m
	    Specifies the callback procedure to be called
	    when a selection request aborts because a time-
	    out expires, or NULL if the owner is not inter-
	    ested in being notified.

4mclient_data24m Specifies the argument to be passed to each of
	    the callback procedures when they are called.
|__

The 4mXtOwnSelectionIncremental24m procedure informs the Intrin-
sics incremental selection mechanism that the specified wid-
get wishes to own the selection.  It returns 4mTrue24m if the



			     1m3150m

specified widget successfully becomes the selection owner or
4mFalse24m otherwise.  For more information about 4mselection24m, 4mtar-0m
4mget24m, and 4mtime24m, see Section 2.6 in the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommuni-0m
4mcation24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m.

If a done_callback procedure is specified, the client owns
the storage allocated for passing the value to the Intrin-
sics.  If 4mdone_callback24m is NULL, the convert_callback proce-
dure must allocate storage using 4mXtMalloc24m, 4mXtRealloc24m, or
4mXtCalloc24m, and the final value specified is freed by the
Intrinsics when the transfer is complete.  After a selection
transfer has started, only one of the done_callback or can-
cel_callback procedures is invoked to indicate completion of
the transfer.

The lose_callback procedure does not indicate completion of
any in-progress transfers; it is invoked at the time a
4mSelectionClear24m event is dispatched regardless of any active
transfers, which are still expected to continue.

A widget that becomes the selection owner using 4mXtOwnSelec-0m
4mtionIncremental24m may use 4mXtDisownSelection24m to relinquish
selection ownership.

4mselection24m Specifies the atom that names the selection.

4mtype24m      Specifies the type of the property in which the
	  parameters are passed.

4mvalue24m     Specifies a pointer to the parameters.

4mlength24m    Specifies the number of elements containing data
	  in 4mvalue24m, each element of a size indicated by 4mfor-0m
	  4mmat24m.

4mformat24m    Specifies the size in bits of the data in the ele-
	  ments of 4mvalue24m.

The specified parameters are copied and stored in a new
property of the specified type and format on the requestor's
window.	 To initiate a selection request with a target and
these parameters, a subsequent call to 4mXtGetSelectionValue0m
or to 4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m specifying the same
requestor widget and selection atom will generate a 4mConvert-0m
4mSelection24m request referring to the property containing the
parameters.  If 4mXtSetSelectionParameters24m is called more than
once with the same widget and selection without a call to
specify a request, the most recently specified parameters
are used in the subsequent request.
|__

The possible values of 4mformat24m are 8, 16, or 32.  If the for-
mat is 8, the elements of 4mvalue24m are assumed to be
sizeof(char); if 16, sizeof(short); if 32, sizeof(long).

To generate a MULTIPLE target request with parameters for
any of the multiple targets of the selection request, pre-
cede individual calls to 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m and 4mXtGetSelec-0m
4mtionValueIncremental24m with corresponding individual calls to
4mXtSetSelectionParameters24m, and enclose these all within

	  transfers.

4mtype_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer to an atom in which the prop-
	  erty type of the parameters is stored.

4mvalue_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which a pointer to the
	  parameters is to be stored.  A NULL is stored if
	  no parameters accompany the request.

4mlength_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which the number of data
	  elements in 4mvalue_return24m of size indicated by 4mfor-0m
	  4mmat_return24m are stored.

4mformat_return0m
	  Specifies a pointer into which the size in bits of

4mXtGetSelectionParameters24m may be called only from within an
4mXtConvertSelectionProc24m or from within the first call to an

4mrequestor24m Specifies the widget making the request.	 Must be
	  of class Core or any subclass thereof.

4mselection24m Specifies the particular selection desired.

When 4mXtCreateSelectionRequest24m is called, subsequent calls to
4mXtGetSelectionValue24m, 4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m, 4mXtGetS-0m
4melectionValues24m, and 4mXtGetSelectionValuesIncremental24m, with
the requestor and selection as specified to 4mXtCreateSelec-0m
4mtionRequest24m, are bundled into a single selection request
with multiple targets.	The request is made by calling
4mXtSendSelectionRequest24m.

__
|
void XtSendSelectionRequest(4mrequestor24m, 4mselection24m, 4mtime24m)
      Widget 4mrequestor24m;
      Atom 4mselection24m;
      Time 4mtime24m;


4mrequestor24m Specifies the widget making the request.	 Must be
	  of class Core or any subclass thereof.

4mselection24m Specifies the particular selection desired.

4mtime24m      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
	  selection request was initiated.  The value 4mCur-0m
	  4mrentTime24m is not acceptable.
|__

When 4mXtSendSelectionRequest24m is called with a value of
4mrequestor24m and 4mselection24m matching a previous call to 4mXtCre-0m
4mateSelectionRequest24m, a selection request is sent to the
selection owner.  If a single target request is queued, that
request is made.  If multiple targets are queued, they are
bundled into a single request with a target of MULTIPLE
using the specified timestamp.	As the values are returned,
the callbacks specified in 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m, 4mXtGetSelec-0m
4mtionValueIncremental24m, 4mXtGetSelectionValues24m, and



			     1m3190m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m are invoked.

Multi-threaded applications should lock the application con-
text before calling 4mXtCreateSelectionRequest24m and release the
lock after calling 4mXtSendSelectionRequest24m to ensure that the
thread assembling the request is safe from interference by
another thread assembling a different request naming the
same widget and selection.


To relinquish the composition of a MULTIPLE request without
sending it, use 4mXtCancelSelectionRequest24m.

__
|
void XtCancelSelectionRequest(4mrequestor24m, 4mselection24m)
      Widget 4mrequestor24m;
      Atom 4mselection24m;


4mrequestor24m Specifies the widget making the request.	 Must be
	  of class Core or any subclass thereof.

4mselection24m Specifies the particular selection desired.
|__

When 4mXtCancelSelectionRequest24m is called, any requests queued
since the last call to 4mXtCreateSelectionRequest24m for the same
widget and selection are discarded and any resources
reserved are released.	A subsequent call to 4mXtSendSelec-0m
4mtionRequest24m will not result in any request being made.  Sub-
sequent calls to 4mXtGetSelectionValue24m, 4mXtGetSelectionValues24m,
4mXtGetSelectionValueIncremental24m, or 4mXtGetSelectionValuesIn-0m
4mcremental24m will not be deferred.


1m11.5.6.  Auxiliary Selection Properties0m

Certain uses of parameterized selections require clients to
name other window properties within a selection parameter.
To permit reuse of temporary property names in these circum-
stances and thereby reduce the number of unique atoms cre-
ated in the server, the Intrinsics provides two interfaces
for acquiring temporary property names.

To acquire a temporary property name atom for use in a
selection request, the client may call 4mXtReserveProperty-0m
4mAtom24m.









			     1m3200m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Atom XtReservePropertyAtom(4mw24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget making a selection request.
|__

4mXtReservePropertyAtom24m returns an atom that may be used as a
property name during selection requests involving the speci-
fied widget.  As long as the atom remains reserved, it is
unique with respect to all other reserved atoms for the wid-
get.

To return a temporary property name atom for reuse and to
delete the property named by that atom, use 4mXtReleaseProp-0m
4mertyAtom24m.

__
|
void XtReleasePropertyAtom(4mw24m, 4matom24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Atom 4matom24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget used to reserve the property
	  name atom.

4matom24m      Specifies the property name atom returned by 4mXtRe-0m
	  4mservePropertyAtom24m that is to be released for re-
	  use.
|__

4mXtReleasePropertyAtom24m marks the specified property name atom
as no longer in use and ensures that any property having
that name on the specified widget's window is deleted.	If
4matom24m does not specify a value returned by 4mXtReserveProperty-0m
4mAtom24m for the specified widget, the results are undefined.


1m11.5.7.  Retrieving the Most Recent Timestamp0m

To retrieve the timestamp from the most recent call to
4mXtDispatchEvent24m that contained a timestamp, use 4mXtLastTimes-0m
4mtampProcessed24m.












			     1m3210m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
Time XtLastTimestampProcessed(4mdisplay24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies an open display connection.
|__

If no 4mKeyPress24m, 4mKeyRelease24m, 4mButtonPress24m, 4mButtonRelease24m,
4mMotionNotify24m, 4mEnterNotify24m, 4mLeaveNotify24m, 4mPropertyNotify24m, or
4mSelectionClear24m event has yet been passed to 4mXtDispatchEvent0m
for the specified display, 4mXtLastTimestampProcessed24m returns
zero.


1m11.5.8.  Retrieving the Most Recent Event0m

To retrieve the event from the most recent call to 4mXtDis-0m
4mpatchEvent24m for a specific display, use 4mXtLastEventProcessed24m.

__
|
XEvent *XtLastEventProcessed(4mdisplay24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display connection from which to
	  retrieve the event.
|__

Returns the last event passed to 4mXtDispatchEvent24m for the
specified display.  Returns NULL if there is no such event.
The client must not modify the contents of the returned
event.


1m11.6.	 Merging Exposure Events into a Region0m

The Intrinsics provide an 4mXtAddExposureToRegion24m utility
function that merges 4mExpose24m and 4mGraphicsExpose24m events into a
region for clients to process at once rather than processing
individual rectangles.	For further information about
regions, see Section 16.5 in 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m.


To merge 4mExpose24m and 4mGraphicsExpose24m events into a region, use
4mXtAddExposureToRegion24m.










			     1m3220m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m

__
|
void XtAddExposureToRegion(4mevent24m, 4mregion24m)
     XEvent *4mevent24m;
     Region 4mregion24m;


4mevent24m     Specifies a pointer to the 4mExpose24m or 4mGraphicsEx-0m
	  4mpose24m event.

4mregion24m    Specifies the region object (as defined in
	  <4mX11/Xutil.h24m>).
|__

The 4mXtAddExposureToRegion24m function computes the union of the
rectangle defined by the exposure event and the specified
region.	 Then it stores the results back in 4mregion24m.  If the
event argument is not an 4mExpose24m or 4mGraphicsExpose24m event,
4mXtAddExposureToRegion24m returns without an error and without
modifying 4mregion24m.

This function is used by the exposure compression mechanism;
see Section 7.9.3.


1m11.7.	 Translating Widget Coordinates0m

To translate an x-y coordinate pair from widget coordinates
to root window absolute coordinates, use 4mXtTranslateCoords24m.

__
|
void XtTranslateCoords(4mw24m, 4mx24m, 4my24m, 4mrootx_return24m, 4mrooty_return24m)
      Widget 4mw24m;
      Position 4mx24m, 4my24m;
      Position *4mrootx_return24m, *4mrooty_return24m;


4mw24m	       Specifies the widget.  Must be of class RectObj or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mx0m
4my24m	       Specify the widget-relative x and y coordinates.

4mrootx_return0m
4mrooty_return0m
	  Return the root-relative x and y coordinates.
|__

While 4mXtTranslateCoords24m is similar to the Xlib 4mXTranslateCo-0m
4mordinates24m function, it does not generate a server request
because all the required information already is in the wid-
get's data structures.





			     1m3230m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m11.8.	 Translating a Window to a Widget0m

To translate a given window and display pointer into a wid-
get instance, use 4mXtWindowToWidget24m.

__
|
Widget XtWindowToWidget(4mdisplay24m, 4mwindow24m)
      Display *4mdisplay24m;
      Window 4mwindow24m;


4mdisplay24m   Specifies the display on which the window is
	  defined.

4mwindow24m    Specifies the drawable for which you want the wid-
	  get.
|__

If there is a realized widget whose window is the specified
drawable on the specified 4mdisplay24m, 4mXtWindowToWidget24m returns
that widget.  If not and if the drawable has been associated
with a widget through 4mXtRegisterDrawable24m, 4mXtWindowToWidget0m
returns the widget associated with the drawable.  In other
cases it returns NULL.


1m11.9.	 Handling Errors0m

The Intrinsics allow a client to register procedures that
are called whenever a fatal or nonfatal error occurs.  These
facilities are intended for both error reporting and logging
and for error correction or recovery.

Two levels of interface are provided:

    A high-level interface that takes an error name and
     class and retrieves the error message text from an
     error resource database.

    A low-level interface that takes a simple string to
     display.

The high-level functions construct a string to pass to the
lower-level interface.	The strings may be specified in
application code and are overridden by the contents of an
external systemwide file, the ``error database file''.	The
location and name of this file are implementation-dependent.









			     1m3240m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


			    Note

     The application-context-specific error handling is
     not implemented on many systems, although the
     interfaces are always present.  Most implementa-
     tions will have just one set of error handlers for
     all application contexts within a process.	 If
     they are set for different application contexts,
     the ones registered last will prevail.



To obtain the error database (for example, to merge with an
application- or widget-specific database), use 4mXtAppGetEr-0m
4mrorDatabase24m.

The 4mXtAppGetErrorDatabase24m function returns the address of
the error database.  The Intrinsics do a lazy binding of the
error database and do not merge in the database file until
the first call to 4mXtAppGetErrorDatabaseText24m.

For a complete listing of all errors and warnings that can
be generated by the Intrinsics, see Appendix D.


The high-level error and warning handler procedure pointers
are of type 4mXtErrorMsgHandler24m.

1m11.11.  Finding File Names0m

The Intrinsics provide procedures to look for a file by
name, allowing string substitutions in a list of file speci-
fications.  Two routines are provided for this: 4mXtFindFile0m
and 4mXtResolvePathname24m.  4mXtFindFile24m uses an arbitrary set of
client-specified substitutions, and 4mXtResolvePathname24m uses a
set of standard substitutions corresponding to the 4mX/Open0m
4mPortability24m 4mGuide24m language localization conventions.	Most
applications should use 4mXtResolvePathname24m.

A string substitution is defined by a list of 4mSubstitution0m
entries.

__
|
typedef Boolean (*XtFilePredicate)(String);
      String 4mfilename24m;


4mfilename24m  Specifies a potential filename.

A file predicate procedure is called with a string that is
potentially a file name.  It should return 4mTrue24m if this
string specifies a file that is appropriate for the intended
use and 4mFalse24m otherwise.

4mpath24m	 Specifies a path of file names, including sub-
	    stitution characters.

4msubstitutions0m
	    Specifies a list of substitutions to make into
	    the path.

4mnum_substitutions0m
	    Specifies the number of substitutions passed in.

4mpredicate24m	 Specifies a procedure called to judge each
	    potential file name, or NULL.
|__

The 4mpath24m parameter specifies a string that consists of a
series of potential file names delimited by colons.  Within



			     1m3340m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


each name, the percent character specifies a string substi-
tution selected by the following character.  The character
sequence ``%:'' specifies an embedded colon that is not a
delimiter; the sequence is replaced by a single colon.	The
character sequence ``%%'' specifies a percent character that
does not introduce a substitution; the sequence is replaced
by a single percent character.	If a percent character is
followed by any other character, 4mXtFindFile24m looks through
the specified 4msubstitutions24m for that character in the 4mmatch0m
field and, if found, replaces the percent and match charac-
ters with the string in the corresponding 4msubstitution0m
field.	A 4msubstitution24m field entry of NULL is equivalent to
a pointer to an empty string.  If the operating system does
not interpret multiple embedded name separators in the path
(i.e., ``/'' in POSIX) the same way as a single separator,
4mXtFindFile24m will collapse multiple separators into a single
one after performing all string substitutions.	Except for
collapsing embedded separators, the contents of the string
substitutions are not interpreted by 4mXtFindFile24m and may
therefore contain any operating-system-dependent characters,
including additional name separators.  Each resulting string
is passed to the predicate procedure until a string is found
for which the procedure returns 4mTrue24m; this string is the
return value for 4mXtFindFile24m.  If no string yields a 4mTrue0m
return from the predicate, 4mXtFindFile24m returns NULL.

If the 4mpredicate24m parameter is NULL, an internal procedure
that checks if the file exists, is readable, and is not a
directory is used.

It is the responsibility of the caller to free the returned
string using 4mXtFree24m when it is no longer needed.


To search for a file using standard substitutions in a path
list, use 4mXtResolvePathname24m.

The substitutions specified by 4mXtResolvePathname24m are deter-
mined from the value of the language string retrieved by
4mXtDisplayInitialize24m for the specified display.  To set the
language for all applications specify ``*xnlLanguage: 4mlang24m''
in the resource database.  The format and content of the
language string are implementation-defined.   One suggested
syntax is to compose the language string of three parts;  a
``language  part'',  a ``territory  part'' and a ``codeset
part''.	 The manner in which this composition is accom-
plished is implementation-defined, and the Intrinsics make
no interpretation of the parts other than to use them in
substitutions as described below.

4mXtResolvePathname24m calls 4mXtFindFile24m with the following sub-
stitutions in addition to any passed by the caller and
returns the value returned by 4mXtFindFile24m:

%N   The value of the 4mfilename24m parameter, or the applica-
     tion's class name if 4mfilename24m is NULL.

%T   The value of the 4mtype24m parameter.





			     1m3360m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


%S   The value of the 4msuffix24m parameter.

%L   The language string associated with the specified dis-
     play.

%l   The language part of the display's language string.

%t   The territory part of the display's language string.

%c   The codeset part of the display's language string.

%C   The customization string retrieved from the resource
     database associated with 4mdisplay24m.

%D   The value of the implementation-specific default path.

If a path is passed to 4mXtResolvePathname24m, it is passed along
to 4mXtFindFile24m.  If the 4mpath24m argument is NULL, the value of
the 4mXFILESEARCHPATH24m environment variable is passed to
4mXtFindFile24m.  If 4mXFILESEARCHPATH24m is not defined, an implemen-
tation-specific default path is used that contains at least
six entries.  These entries must contain the following sub-
stitutions:

1. %C, %N, %S, %T, %L	 or%C, %N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c
2. %C, %N, %S, %T, %l
3. %C, %N, %S, %T
4. %N, %S, %T, %L   or	 %N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c
5. %N, %S, %T, %l
6. %N, %S, %T

The order of these six entries within the path must be as
given above.  The order and use of substitutions within a
given entry are implementation-dependent.  If the path
begins with a colon, it is preceded by %N%S.  If the path
includes two adjacent colons, 1m%N%S 22mis inserted between them.

The 4mtype24m parameter is intended to be a category of files,
usually being translated into a directory in the pathname.
Possible values might include ``app-defaults'', ``help'',
and ``bitmap''.

The 4msuffix24m parameter is intended to be appended to the file
name.  Possible values might include ``.txt'', ``.dat'', and
``.bm''.

A suggested value for the default path on POSIX-based sys-
tems is

     /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:\
     /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:\
     /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S





			     1m3370m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


Using this example, if the user has specified a language, it
is used as a subdirectory of /usr/lib/X11 that is searched
for other files.  If the desired file is not found there,
the lookup is tried again using just the language part of
the specification.  If the file is not there, it is looked
for in /usr/lib/X11.  The 4mtype24m parameter is used as a subdi-
rectory of the language directory or of /usr/lib/X11, and
4msuffix24m is appended to the file name.

The %D substitution allows the addition of path elements to
the implementation-specific default path, typically to allow
additional directories to be searched without preventing
resources in the system directories from being found.  For
example, a user installing resource files under a directory
called ``ourdir'' might set 4mXFILESEARCHPATH24m to

     %D:ourdir/%T/%N%C:ourdir/%T/%N

The customization string is obtained by querying the
resource database currently associated with the display (the
database returned by 4mXrmGetDatabase24m) for the resource 4mappli-0m
4mcation_name24m.customization, class 4mapplication_class24m.Cus-
tomization, where 4mapplication_name24m and 4mapplication_class24m are
the values returned by 4mXtGetApplicationNameAndClass24m.  If no
value is specified in the database, the empty string is
used.

It is the responsibility of the caller to free the returned
string using 4mXtFree24m when it is no longer needed.


1m11.12.  Hooks for External Agents0m

Applications may register functions that are called at a
particular control points in the Intrinsics.  These func-
tions are intended to be used to provide notification of an
"X Toolkit event", such as widget creation, to an external
agent, such as an interactive resource editor, drag-and-drop
server, or an aid for physically challenged users.  The con-
trol points containing such registration hooks are identi-
fied in a "hook registration" object.

		     1mNonwidget Objects0m




Although widget writers are free to treat Core as the base
class of the widget hierarchy, there are actually three
classes above it.  These classes are Object, RectObj (Rec-
tangle Object), and (4munnamed24m), and members of these classes
are referred to generically as 4mobjects24m.  By convention, the
term 4mwidget24m refers only to objects that are a subclass of
Core, and the term 4mnonwidget24m refers to objects that are not
a subclass of Core.  In the preceding portion of this speci-
fication, the interface descriptions indicate explicitly
whether the generic 4mwidget24m argument is restricted to partic-
ular subclasses of Object.  Sections 12.2.5, 12.3.5, and
12.5 summarize the permissible classes of the arguments to,
and return values from, each of the Intrinsics routines.


1m12.1.	 Data Structures0m

In order not to conflict with previous widget code, the data
structures used by nonwidget objects do not follow all the
same conventions as those for widgets.	In particular, the
class records are not composed of parts but instead are com-
plete data structures with filler for the widget fields they
do not use.  This allows the static class initializers for
existing widgets to remain unchanged.


1m12.2.	 Object Objects0m

The Object object contains the definitions of fields common
to all objects.	 It encapsulates the mechanisms for resource
management.  All objects and widgets are members of sub-
classes of Object, which is defined by the 4mObjectClassPart0m
and 4mObjectPart24m structures.


1m12.2.1.  ObjectClassPart Structure0m

The common fields for all object classes are defined in the
4mObjectClassPart24m structure.	 All fields have the same pur-
pose, function, and restrictions as the corresponding fields
in 4mCoreClassPart24m; fields whose names are obj4mn24m for some inte-
ger 4mn24m are not used for Object, but exist to pad the data
structure so that it matches Core's class record.  The class
record initialization must fill all obj4mn24m fields with NULL or
zero as appropriate to the type.

1m12.2.6.  Use of Objects0m

The Object class exists to enable programmers to use the
Intrinsics' classing and resource-handling mechanisms for
things smaller and simpler than widgets.  Objects make obso-
lete many common uses of subresources as described in Sec-
tions 9.4, 9.7.2.4, and 9.7.2.5.

Composite widget classes that wish to accept nonwidget chil-
dren must set the 4maccepts_objects24m field in the 4mComposite-0m
4mClassExtension24m structure to 4mTrue24m.  4mXtCreateWidget24m will



			     1m3520m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


otherwise generate an error message on an attempt to create
a nonwidget child.

Of the classes defined by the Intrinsics, ApplicationShell
and SessionShell accept nonwidget children, and the class of
any nonwidget child must not be 4mrectObjClass24m or any sub-
class.	The intent of allowing Object children of Applica-
tionShell and SessionShell is to provide clients a simple
mechanism for establishing the resource-naming root of an
object hierarchy.


1m12.3.	 Rectangle Objects0m

The class of rectangle objects is a subclass of Object that
represents rectangular areas.  It encapsulates the mecha-
nisms for geometry management and is called RectObj to avoid
conflict with the Xlib 4mRectangle24m data type.


1m12.3.1.  RectObjClassPart Structure0m

As with the 4mObjectClassPart24m structure, all fields in the
4mRectObjClassPart24m structure have the same purpose and func-
tion as the corresponding fields in 4mCoreClassPart24m; fields
whose names are rect4mn24m for some integer 4mn24m are not used for
RectObj, but exist to pad the data structure so that it
matches Core's class record.  The class record initializa-
tion must fill all rect4mn24m fields with NULL or zero as appro-
priate to the type.

     4mXtTranslateCoords0m


The return value of the following procedures will be of
class RectObj or a subclass:


     4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m, 4mXtVaCreateManagedWidget0m


1m12.3.6.  Use of Rectangle Objects0m

RectObj can be subclassed to provide widgetlike objects
(sometimes called gadgets) that do not use windows and do
not have those features that are seldom used in simple wid-
gets.  This can save memory resources both in the server and
in applications but requires additional support code in the
parent.	 In the following discussion, 4mrectobj24m refers only to
objects whose class is RectObj or a subclass of RectObj, but
not Core or a subclass of Core.

Composite widget classes that wish to accept rectobj chil-
dren must set the 4maccepts_objects24m field in the 4mComposite-0m
4mClassExtension24m extension structure to 4mTrue24m.  4mXtCreateWidget0m
or 4mXtCreateManagedWidget24m will otherwise generate an error if
called to create a nonwidget child.  If the composite widget
supports only children of class RectObj or a subclass (i.e.,
not of the general Object class), it must declare an
insert_child procedure and check the subclass of each new
child in that procedure.  None of the classes defined by the
Intrinsics accept rectobj children.

If gadgets are defined in an object set, the parent is
responsible for much more than the parent of a widget.	The
parent must request and handle input events that occur for
the gadget and is responsible for making sure that when it
receives an exposure event the gadget children get drawn
correctly.  Rectobj children may have expose procedures
specified in their class records, but the parent is free to
ignore them, instead drawing the contents of the child
itself.	 This can potentially save graphics context switch-
ing.  The precise contents of the exposure event and region
arguments to the RectObj expose procedure are not specified



			     1m3570m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


by the Intrinsics; a particular rectangle object is free to
define the coordinate system origin (self-relative or par-
ent-relative) and whether or not the rectangle or region is
assumed to have been intersected with the visible region of
the object.

In general, it is expected that a composite widget that
accepts nonwidget children will document those children it
is able to handle, since a gadget cannot be viewed as a com-
pletely self-contained entity, as can a widget.	 Since a
particular composite widget class is usually designed to
handle nonwidget children of only a limited set of classes,
it should check the classes of newly added children in its
insert_child procedure to make sure that it can deal with
them.

The Intrinsics will clear areas of a parent window obscured
by rectobj children, causing exposure events, under the fol-
lowing circumstances:

    A rectobj child is managed or unmanaged.

    In a call to 4mXtSetValues24m on a rectobj child, one or
     more of the set_values procedures returns 4mTrue24m.

    In a call to 4mXtConfigureWidget24m on a rectobj child,
     areas will be cleared corresponding to both the old and
     the new child geometries, including the border, if the
     geometry changes.

    In a call to 4mXtMoveWidget24m on a rectobj child, areas
     will be cleared corresponding to both the old and the
     new child geometries, including the border, if the
     geometry changes.

    In a call to 4mXtResizeWidget24m on a rectobj child, a sin-
     gle rectangle will be cleared corresponding to the
     larger of the old and the new child geometries if they
     are different.

    In a call to 4mXtMakeGeometryRequest24m (or 4mXtMakeResiz-0m
     4meRequest24m) on a rectobj child with 4mXtQueryOnly24m not set,
     if the manager returns 4mXtGeometryYes24m, two rectangles
     will be cleared corresponding to both the old and the
     new child geometries.

Stacking order is not supported for rectobj children.  Com-
posite widgets with rectobj children are free to define any
semantics desired if the child geometries overlap, including
making this an error.

When a rectobj is playing the role of a widget, developers
must be reminded to avoid making assumptions about the
object passed in the Widget argument to a callback

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


procedure.


1m12.4.	 Undeclared Class0m

The Intrinsics define an unnamed class between RectObj and
Core for possible future use by the X Consortium. The only
assumptions that may be made about the unnamed class are

    The 4mcore_class.superclass24m field of 4mcoreWidgetClassRec0m
     contains a pointer to the unnamed class record.

    A pointer to the unnamed class record when dereferenced
     as an 4mObjectClass24m will contain a pointer to 4mrectObj-0m
     4mClassRec24m in its 4mobject_class.superclass24m field.

Except for the above, the contents of the class record for
this class and the result of an attempt to subclass or to
create a widget of this unnamed class are undefined.

		   1mEvolution of the Intrinsics0m




The interfaces described by this specification have under-
gone several sets of revisions in the course of adoption as
an X Consortium standard specification.	 Having now been
adopted by the Consortium as a standard part of the X Window
System, it is expected that this and future revisions will
retain backward compatibility in the sense that fully con-
forming implementations of these specifications may be pro-
duced that provide source compatibility with widgets and
applications written to previous Consortium standard revi-
sions.

The Intrinsics do not place any special requirement on wid-
get programmers to retain source or binary compatibility for
their widgets as they evolve, but several conventions have
been established to assist those developers who want to pro-
vide such compatibility.

In particular, widget programmers may wish to conform to the
convention described in Section 1.6.12 when defining class
extension records.


1m13.1.	 Determining Specification Revision Level0m

Widget and application developers who wish to maintain a
common source pool that will build properly with implementa-
tions of the Intrinsics at different revision levels of
these specifications but that take advantage of newer fea-
tures added in later revisions may use the symbolic macro
4mXtSpecificationRelease24m.


#define XtSpecificationRelease 6


As the symbol 4mXtSpecificationRelease24m was new to Release 4,
widgets and applications desiring to build against earlier
implementations should test for the presence of this symbol
and assume only Release 3 interfaces if the definition is
not present.








			     1m3620m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m13.2.	 Release 3 to Release 4 Compatibility0m

At the data structure level, Release 4 retains binary com-
patibility with Release 3 (the first X Consortium standard
release) for all data structures except 4mWMShellPart,0m
4mTopLevelShellPart24m, and 4mTransientShellPart24m.  Release 4
changed the argument type to most procedures that now take
arguments of type 4mXtPointer24m and structure members that are
now of type 4mXtPointer24m in order to avoid potential ANSI C
conformance problems.  It is expected that most implementa-
tions will be binary compatible with the previous defini-
tion.

Two fields in 4mCoreClassPart24m were changed from 4mBoolean24m to
4mXtEnum24m to allow implementations additional freedom in speci-
fying the representations of each.  This change should
require no source modification.


1m13.2.1.  Additional Arguments0m

Arguments were added to the procedure definitions for
4mXtInitProc24m, 4mXtSetValuesFunc24m, and 4mXtEventHandler24m to provide
more information and to allow event handlers to abort fur-
ther dispatching of the current event (caution is advised!).
The added arguments to 4mXtInitProc24m and 4mXtSetValuesFunc24m make
the initialize_hook and set_values_hook methods obsolete,
but the hooks have been retained for those widgets that used
them in Release 3.


1m13.2.2.  set_values_almost Procedures0m

The use of the arguments by a set_values_almost procedure
was poorly described in Release 3 and was inconsistent with
other conventions.

The current specification for the manner in which a set_val-
ues_almost procedure returns information to the Intrinsics
is not compatible with the Release 3 specification, and all
widget implementations should verify that any set_val-
ues_almost procedures conform to the current interface.

No known implementation of the Intrinsics correctly imple-
mented the Release 3 interface, so it is expected that the
impact of this specification change is small.


1m13.2.3.  Query Geometry0m

A composite widget layout routine that calls 4mXtQueryGeometry0m
is now expected to store the complete new geometry in the
intended structure; previously the specification said
``store the changes it intends to make''.  Only by storing



			     1m3630m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


the complete geometry does the child have any way to know
what other parts of the geometry may still be flexible.
Existing widgets should not be affected by this, except to
take advantage of the new information.


1m13.2.4.  unrealizeCallback Callback List0m

In order to provide a mechanism for widgets to be notified
when they become unrealized through a call to 4mXtUnreal-0m
4mizeWidget24m, the callback list name ``unrealizeCallback'' has
been defined by the Intrinsics.	 A widget class that
requires notification on unrealize may declare a callback
list resource by this name.  No class is required to declare
this resource, but any class that did so in a prior revision
may find it necessary to modify the resource name if it does
not wish to use the new semantics.


1m13.2.5.  Subclasses of WMShell0m

The formal adoption of the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mCon-0m
4mventions24m 4mManual24m as an X Consortium standard has meant the
addition of four fields to 4mWMShellPart24m and one field to
4mTopLevelShellPart24m.	 In deference to some widget libraries
that had developed their own additional conventions to pro-
vide binary compatibility, these five new fields were added
at the end of the respective data structures.

To provide more convenience for TransientShells, a field was
added to the previously empty 4mTransientShellPart24m.	On some
architectures the size of the part structure will not have
changed as a result of this.

Any widget implementation whose class is a subclass of
TopLevelShell or TransientShell must at minimum be recom-
piled with the new data structure declarations.	 Because
4mWMShellPart24m no longer contains a contiguous 4mXSizeHints24m data
structure, a subclass that expected to do a single structure
assignment of an 4mXSizeHints24m structure to the 4msize_hints0m
field of 4mWMShellPart24m must be revised, though the old fields
remain at the same positions within 4mWMShellPart24m.


1m13.2.6.  Resource Type Converters0m

A new interface declaration for resource type converters was
defined to provide more information to converters, to sup-
port conversion cache cleanup with resource reference count-
ing, and to allow additional procedures to be declared to
free resources.	 The old interfaces remain (in the compati-
bility section), and a new set of procedures was defined
that work only with the new type converter interface.




			     1m3640m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


In the now obsolete old type converter interface, converters
are reminded that they must return the size of the converted
value as well as its address.  The example indicated this,
but the description of 4mXtConverter24m was incomplete.


1m13.2.7.  KeySym Case Conversion Procedure0m

The specification for the 4mXtCaseProc24m function type has been
changed to match the Release 3 implementation, which
included necessary additional information required by the
function (a pointer to the display connection), and corrects
the argument type of the source KeySym parameter.  No known
implementation of the Intrinsics implemented the previously
documented interface.


1m13.2.8.  Nonwidget Objects0m

Formal support for nonwidget objects is new to Release 4.  A
prototype implementation was latent in at least one Release
3 implementation of the Intrinsics, but the specification
has changed somewhat.  The most significant change is the
requirement for a composite widget to declare the 4mComposite-0m
4mClassExtension24m record with the 4maccepts_objects24m field set to
4mTrue24m in order to permit a client to create a nonwidget
child.

The addition of this extension field ensures that composite
widgets written under Release 3 will not encounter unex-
pected errors if an application attempts to create a nonwid-
get child.  In Release 4 there is no requirement that all
composite widgets implement the extra functionality required
to manage windowless children, so the 4maccept_objects24m field
allows a composite widget to declare that it is not prepared
to do so.


1m13.3.	 Release 4 to Release 5 Compatibility0m

At the data structure level, Release 5 retains complete
binary compatibility with Release 4.  The specification of
the 4mObjectPart24m, 4mRectObjPart24m, 4mCorePart24m, 4mCompositePart24m, 4mShell-0m
4mPart24m, 4mWMShellPart24m, 4mTopLevelShellPart24m, and 4mApplicationShell-0m
4mPart24m instance records was made less strict to permit imple-
mentations to add internal fields to these structures.	Any
implementation that chooses to do so would, of course, force
a recompilation.  The Xlib specification for 4mXrmValue24m and
4mXrmOptionDescRec24m was updated to use a new type, 4mXPointer24m,
for the 4maddr24m and 4mvalue24m fields, respectively, to avoid ANSI C
conformance problems.  The definition of 4mXPointer24m is binary
compatible with the previous implementation.

1m13.3.1.  baseTranslations Resource0m


A new pseudo-resource, XtNbaseTranslations, was defined to
permit application developers to specify translation tables
in application defaults files while still giving end users
the ability to augment or override individual event
sequences.  This change will affect only those applications
that wish to take advantage of the new functionality or
those widgets that may have previously defined a resource
named ``baseTranslations''.

Applications wishing to take advantage of the new function-
ality would change their application defaults file, e.g.,
from

	  app.widget.translations: 4mvalue0m

to

	  app.widget.baseTranslations: 4mvalue0m

If it is important to the application to preserve complete
compatibility of the defaults file between different ver-
sions of the application running under Release 4 and Release
5, the full translations can be replicated in both the
``translations'' and the ``baseTranslations'' resource.


1m13.3.2.  Resource File Search Path0m


The current specification allows implementations greater
flexibility in defining the directory structure used to hold
the application class and per-user application defaults
files.	Previous specifications required the substitution
strings to appear in the default path in a certain order,
preventing sites from collecting all the files for a spe-
cific application together in one directory.  The Release 5
specification allows the default path to specify the substi-
tution strings in any order within a single path entry.
Users will need to pay close attention to the documentation
for the specific implementation to know where to find these
files and how to specify their own 4mXFILESEARCHPATH24m and
4mXUSERFILESEARCHPATH24m values when overriding the system
defaults.


1m13.3.3.  Customization Resource0m


4mXtResolvePathname24m supports a new substitution string, %C,
for specifying separate application class resource files
according to arbitrary user-specified categories.  The



			     1m3660m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


primary motivation for this addition was separate monochrome
and color application class defaults files.  The substitu-
tion value is obtained by querying the current resource
database for the application resource name ``customiza-
tion'', class ``Customization''.  Any application that pre-
viously used this resource name and class will need to be
aware of the possibly conflicting semantics.


1m13.3.4.  Per-Screen Resource Database0m


To allow a user to specify separate preferences for each
screen of a display, a per-screen resource specification
string has been added and multiple resource databases are
created; one for each screen.  This will affect any applica-
tion that modified the (formerly unique) resource database
associated with the display subsequent to the Intrinsics
database initialization.  Such applications will need to be
aware of the particular screen on which each shell widget is
to be created.

Although the wording of the specification changed substan-
tially in the description of the process by which the
resource database(s) is initialized, the net effect is the
same as in prior releases with the exception of the added
per-screen resource specification and the new customization
substitution string in 4mXtResolvePathname24m.


1m13.3.5.  Internationalization of Applications0m


Internationalization as defined by ANSI is a technology that
allows support of an application in a single locale.  In
adding support for internationalization to the Intrinsics
the restrictions of this model have been followed.  In par-
ticular, the new Intrinsics interfaces are designed not to
preclude an application from using other alternatives.	For
this reason, no Intrinsics routine makes a call to establish
the locale.   However, a convenience routine to establish
the locale at initialize time has been provided, in the form
of a default procedure that must be explicitly installed if
the application desires ANSI C locale behavior.

As many objects in X, particularly resource databases, now
inherit the global locale when they are created, applica-
tions wishing to use the ANSI C locale model should use the
new function 4mXtSetLanguageProc24m to do so.

The internationalization additions also define event filters
as a part of the Xlib Input Method specifications.  The
Intrinsics enable the use of event filters through additions
to 4mXtDispatchEvent24m.  Applications that may not be



			     1m3670m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


dispatching all events through 4mXtDispatchEvent24m should be
reviewed in the context of this new input method mechanism.

In order to permit internationalization of error messages,
the name and path of the error database file are now allowed
to be implementation-dependent.	 No adequate standard mecha-
nism has yet been suggested to allow the Intrinsics to
locate the database from localization information supplied
by the client.

The previous specification for the syntax of the language
string specified by 4mxnlLanguage24m has been dropped to avoid
potential conflicts with other standards.  The language
string syntax is now implementation-defined.  The example
syntax cited is consistent with the previous specification.


1m13.3.6.  Permanently Allocated Strings0m


In order to permit additional memory savings, an Xlib inter-
face was added to allow the resource manager to avoid copy-
ing certain string constants.  The Intrinsics specification
was updated to explicitly require the Object 4mclass_name24m,
4mresource_name24m, 4mresource_class24m, 4mresource_type24m, 4mdefault_type0m
in resource tables, Core 4mactions24m 4mstring24m field, and Con-
straint 4mresource_name24m, 4mresource_class24m, 4mresource_type24m, and
4mdefault_type24m resource fields to be permanently allocated.
This explicit requirement is expected to affect only appli-
cations that may create and destroy classes on the fly.


1m13.3.7.  Arguments to Existing Functions0m


The 4margs24m argument to 4mXtAppInitialize24m, 4mXtVaAppInitialize24m,
4mXtOpenDisplay24m, 4mXtDisplayInitialize24m, and 4mXtInitialize24m were
changed from 4mCardinal24m* to int* to conform to pre-existing
convention and avoid otherwise annoying typecasting in ANSI
C environments.


1m13.4.	 Release 5 to Release 6 Compatibility0m

At the data structure level, Release 6 retains binary com-
patibility with Release 5 for all data structures except
4mWMShellPart24m.  Three resources were added to the specifica-
tion.  The known implementations had unused space in the
data structure, therefore on some architectures and imple-
mentations, the size of the part structure will not have
changed as a result of this.






			     1m3680m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m13.4.1.  Widget Internals0m

Two new widget methods for instance allocation and dealloca-
tion were added to the Object class.  These new methods
allow widgets to be treated as C++ objects in the C++ envi-
ronment when an appropriate allocation method is specified
or inherited by the widget class.

The textual descriptions of the processes of widget creation
and widget destruction have been edited to provide clarifi-
cation to widget writers.  Widgets writers may have reason
to rely on the specific order of the stages of widget cre-
ation and destruction; with that motivation, the specifica-
tion now more exactly describes the process.

As a convenience, an interface to locate a widget class
extension record on a linked list, 4mXtGetClassExtension24m, has
been added.

A new option to allow bundled changes to the managed set of
a Composite widget is introduced in the Composite class
extension record.  Widgets that define a change_managed pro-
cedure that can accommodate additions and deletions to the
managed set of children in a single invocation should set
allows_change_managed_set to 1mTrue 22min the extension record.

The wording of the process followed by 4mXtUnmanageChildren0m
has changed slightly to better handle changes to the managed
set during phase 2 destroy processing.

A new exposure event compression flag, 4mXtExposeNoRegion24m, was
added.	Many widgets specify exposure compression, but
either ignore the actual damage region passed to the core
expose procedure or use only the cumulative bounding box
data available in the event.  Widgets with expose procedures
that do not make use of exact exposure region information
can indicate that the Intrinsics need not compute the
region.


1m13.4.2.  General Application Development0m

4mXtOpenApplication24m is a new convenience procedure to initial-
ize the toolkit, create an application context, open an X
display connection, and create the root of the widget
instance tree.	It is identical to the interface it
replaces, 4mXtAppInitialize24m, in all respects except that it
takes an additional argument specifying the widget class of
the root shell to create.  This interface is now the recom-
mended one so that clients may easily become session partic-
ipants.	 The old convenience procedures appear in the com-
patibility section.





			     1m3690m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


The toolkit initialization function 4mXtToolkitInitialize24m may
be called multiple times without penalty.

In order to optimize changes in geometry to a set of geome-
try-managed children, a new interface, 4mXtChangeManagedSet24m,
has been added.


1m13.4.3.  Communication with Window and Session Managers0m

The revision of the 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions0m
4mManual24m as an X Consortium standard has resulted in the addi-
tion of three fields to the specification of 4mWMShellPart24m.
These are 4murgency24m, 4mclient_leader24m, and 4mwindow_role24m.

The adoption of the 4mX24m 4mSession24m 4mManagement24m 4mProtocol24m as an X
Consortium standard has resulted in the addition of a new
shell widget, 4mSessionShell24m, and an accompanying subclass
verification interface, 4mXtIsSessionShell24m.	This widget pro-
vides support for communication between an application and a
session manager, as well as a window manager.  In order to
preserve compatibility with existing subclasses of 4mApplica-0m
4mtionShell24m, the 4mApplicationShell24m was subclassed to create the
new widget class.  The session protocol requires a modal
response to certain checkpointing operations by participat-
ing applications.  The 4mSessionShell24m structures the applica-
tion's notification of and responses to messages from the
session manager by use of various callback lists and by use
of the new interfaces 4mXtSessionGetToken24m and 4mXtSessionReturn-0m
4mToken24m.  There is also a new command line argument, -xtses-
sionID, which facilitates the session manager in restarting
applications based on the Intrinsics.

The resource name and class strings defined by the Intrin-
sics shell widgets in <4mX11/Shell.h24m> are now listed in Appen-
dix E.	The addition of a new symbol for the 4mWMShell0m
4mwait_for_wm24m resource was made to bring the external symbol
and the string it represents into agreement.  The actual
resource name string in 4mWMShell24m has not changed.  The
resource representation type of the XtNwinGravity resource
of the 4mWMShell24m was changed to XtRGravity in order to regis-
ter a type converter so that window gravity resource values
could be specified by name.


1m13.4.4.  Geometry Management0m

A clarification to the specification was made to indicate
that geometry requests may include current values along with
the requested changes.







			     1m3700m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


1m13.4.5.  Event Management0m

In Release 6, support is provided for registering selectors
and event handlers for events generated by X protocol exten-
sions and for dispatching those events to the appropriate
widget.	 The new event handler registration interfaces are
4mXtInsertEventTypeHandler24m and 4mXtRemoveEventTypeHandler24m.
Since the mechanism to indicate selection of extension
events is specific to the extension being used, the Intrin-
sics introduces 4mXtRegisterExtensionSelector24m, which allows
the application to select for the events of interest.  In
order to change the dispatching algorithm to accommodate
extension events as well as core X protocol events, the
Intrinsics event dispatcher may now be replaced or enveloped
by the application with 4mXtSetEventDispatcher24m.  The dis-
patcher may wish to call 4mXtGetKeyboardFocusWidget24m to deter-
mine the widget with the current Intrinsics keyboard focus.
A dispatcher, after determining the destination widget, may
use 4mXtDispatchEventToWidget24m to cause the event to be dis-
patched to the event handlers registered by a specific wid-
get.

To permit the dispatching of events for nonwidget drawables,
such as pixmaps that are not associated with a widget's win-
dow, 4mXtRegisterDrawable24m and 4mXtUnregisterDrawable24m have been
added to the library.  A related update was made to the
description of 4mXtWindowToWidget24m.

The library is now thread-safe, allowing one thread at a
time to enter the library and protecting global data as nec-
essary from concurrent use.  Threaded toolkit applications
are supported by the new interfaces 4mXtToolkitThreadInitial-0m
4mize24m, 4mXtAppLock24m, 4mXtAppUnlock24m, 4mXtAppSetExitFlag24m, and 4mXtAppGe-0m
4mtExitFlag24m.	 Widget writers may also use 4mXtProcessLock24m and
4mXtProcessUnlock24m.

Safe handling of POSIX signals and other asynchronous noti-
fications is now provided by use of 4mXtAppAddSignal24m, 4mXtNo-0m
4mticeSignal24m, and 4mXtRemoveSignal24m.

The application can receive notification of an impending
block in the Intrinsics event manager by registering inter-
est through 4mXtAppAddBlockHook24m and 4mXtRemoveBlockHook24m.

4mXtLastEventProcessed24m returns the most recent event passed to
4mXtDispatchEvent24m for a specified display.


1m13.4.6.  Resource Management0m

Resource converters are registered by the Intrinsics for
window gravity and for three new resource types associated
with session participation: RestartStyle, CommandArgArray
and DirectoryString.



			     1m3710m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


The file search path syntax has been extended to make it
easier to include the default search path, which controls
resource database construction, by using the new substitu-
tion string, %D.


1m13.4.7.  Translation Management0m

The default key translator now recognizes the NumLock modi-
fier.  If NumLock is on and the second keysym is a keypad
keysym (a standard keysym named with a ``KP'' prefix or a
vendor-specific keysym in the hexadecimal range 0x11000000
to 0x1100FFFF), then the default key translator will use the
first keysym if Shift and/or ShiftLock is on and will use
the second keysym if neither is on.  Otherwise, it will
ignore NumLock and apply the normal protocol semantics.


1m13.4.8.  Selections0m

The targets of selection requests may be parameterized, as
described by the revised 4mInter-Client24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConven-0m
4mtions24m 4mManual24m.	 When such requests are made, 4mXtSetSelection-0m
4mParameters24m is used by the requestor to specify the target
parameters and 4mXtGetSelectionParameters24m is used by the
selection owner to retrieve the parameters.  When a parame-
terized target is specified in the context of a bundled
request for multiple targets, 4mXtCreateSelectionRequest24m,
4mXtCancelSelectionRequest24m, and 4mXtSendSelectionRequest24m are
used to envelop the assembly of the request.  When the
parameters themselves are the names of properties, the
Intrinsics provides support for the economical use of prop-
erty atom names; see 4mXtReservePropertyAtom24m and 4mXtRelease-0m
4mPropertyAtom24m.


1m13.4.9.  External Agent Hooks0m

External agent hooks were added for the benefit of applica-
tions that instrument other applications for purposes of
accessibility, testing, and customization.  The external
agent and the application communicate by a shared protocol
which is transparent to the application.  The hook callbacks
permit the external agent to register interest in groups or
classes of toolkit activity and to be notified of the type
and details of the activity as it occurs.  The new inter-
faces related to this effort are 4mXtHooksOfDisplay24m, which
returns the hook registration widget, and 4mXtGetDisplays24m,
which returns a list of the X displays associated with an
application context.

		    1mResource File Format0m



A resource file contains text representing the default
resource values for an application or set of applications.

The format of resource files is defined by 4mXlib24m 4m--24m 4mC24m 4mLan-0m
4mguage24m 4mX24m 4mInterface24m and is reproduced here for convenience
only.

The format of a resource specification is

ResourceLine	= Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | <empty line>
Comment		= ``!'' {<any character except null or newline>}
IncludeFile	= ``#'' WhiteSpace ``include'' WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
FileName	= <valid filename for operating system>
ResourceSpec	= WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ``:'' WhiteSpace Value
ResourceName	= [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
Binding		= ``.'' | ``*''
WhiteSpace	= {<space> | <horizontal tab>}
Component	= ``?'' | ComponentName
ComponentName	= NameChar {NameChar}
NameChar	= ``a''-``z'' | ``A''-``Z'' | ``0''-``9'' | ``_'' | ``-''
Value		= {<any character except null or unescaped newline>}


Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of
the enclosed elements.	Square brackets ([...]) indicate
that the enclosed element is optional.	Quotes (``...'') are
used around literal characters.

If the last character on a line is a backslash (\), that
line is assumed to continue on the next line.

To allow a Value to begin with whitespace, the two-character
sequence ``\4mspace24m'' (backslash followed by space) is recog-
nized and replaced by a space character, and the two-charac-
ter sequence ``\4mtab24m'' (backslash followed by horizontal tab)
is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.

To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters, the
two-character sequence ``\n'' is recognized and replaced by
a newline character.  To allow a Value to be broken across
multiple lines in a text file, the two-character sequence
``\4mnewline24m'' (backslash followed by newline) is recognized
and removed from the value.

To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the



			     1m3730m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


four-character sequence ``\4mnnn24m'', where each 4mn24m is a digit
character in the range of ``0''-``7'', is recognized and
replaced with a single byte that contains the octal value
specified by the sequence.  Finally, the two-character
sequence ``\\'' is recognized and replaced with a single
backslash.

		  1mTranslation Table Syntax0m




1mNotation0m

Syntax is specified in EBNF notation with the following con-
ventions:

[ a ]	    Means either nothing or ``a''
{ a }	    Means zero or more occurrences of ``a''
( a | b )   Means either ``a'' or ``b''
\\n	    Is the newline character


All terminals are enclosed in double quotation marks (``
'').  Informal descriptions are enclosed in angle brackets
(< >).

1mSyntax0m

The syntax of a translation table is

translationTable   = [ directive ] { production }
directive	   = ( ``#replace'' | ``#override'' | ``#augment'' ) ``\\n''
production	   = lhs ``:'' rhs ``\\n''
lhs		   = ( event | keyseq ) { ``,'' (event | keyseq) }
keyseq		   = ``"'' keychar {keychar} ``"''
keychar		   = [ ``^'' | ``$'' | ``\\'' ] <ISO Latin 1 character>
event		   = [modifier_list] ``<''event_type``>'' [ ``('' count[``+''] ``)'' ] {detail}
modifier_list	   = ( [``!''] [``:''] {modifier} ) | ``None''
modifier	   = [``~''] modifier_name
count		   = (``1'' | ``2'' | ``3'' | ``4'' | ...)
modifier_name	   = ``@'' <keysym> | <see ModifierNames table below>
event_type	   = <see Event Types table below>
detail		   = <event specific details>
rhs		   = { name ``('' [params] ``)'' }
name		   = namechar { namechar }
namechar	   = { ``a''-``z'' | ``A''-``Z'' | ``0''-``9'' | ``_'' | ``-'' }
params		   = string {``,'' string}
string		   = quoted_string | unquoted_string
quoted_string	   = ``"'' {<Latin 1 character> | escape_char} [``\\\\'' ] ``"''
escape_char	   = ``\\"''
unquoted_string	   = {<Latin 1 character except space, tab, ``,'', ``\\n'', ``)''>}



The 4mparams24m field is parsed into a list of 4mString24m values that
will be passed to the named action procedure.  A 4mquoted0m



			     1m3750m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


4mstring24m may contain an embedded quotation mark if the quota-
tion mark is preceded by a single backslash (\).  The three-
character sequence ``\\"'' is interpreted as ``single back-
slash followed by end-of-string''.


1mModifier Names0m

The modifier field is used to specify standard X keyboard
and button modifier mask bits.	Modifiers are legal on event
types 4mKeyPress24m, 4mKeyRelease24m, 4mButtonPress24m, 4mButtonRelease24m,
4mMotionNotify24m, 4mEnterNotify24m, 4mLeaveNotify24m, and their abbrevia-
tions.	An error is generated when a translation table that
contains modifiers for any other events is parsed.

    If the modifier list has no entries and is not
     ``None'', it means ``don't care'' on all modifiers.

    If an exclamation point (!) is specified at the begin-
     ning of the modifier list, it means that the listed
     modifiers must be in the correct state and no other
     modifiers can be asserted.

    If any modifiers are specified and an exclamation point
     (!) is not specified, it means that the listed modi-
     fiers must be in the correct state and ``don't care''
     about any other modifiers.

    If a modifier is preceded by a tilde (~), it means that
     that modifier must not be asserted.

    If ``None'' is specified, it means no modifiers can be
     asserted.

    If a colon (:) is specified at the beginning of the
     modifier list, it directs the Intrinsics to apply any
     standard modifiers in the event to map the event key-
     code into a KeySym.  The default standard modifiers are
     Shift and Lock, with the interpretation as defined in 4mX0m
     4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Section 5.	The resulting
     KeySym must exactly match the specified KeySym, and the
     nonstandard modifiers in the event must match the modi-
     fier list.	 For example, ``:<Key>a'' is distinct from
     ``:<Key>A'', and ``:Shift<Key>A'' is distinct from
     ``:<Key>A''.

    If both an exclamation point (!) and a colon (:) are
     specified at the beginning of the modifier list, it
     means that the listed modifiers must be in the correct
     state and that no other modifiers except the standard
     modifiers can be asserted.	 Any standard modifiers in
     the event are applied as for colon (:) above.





			     1m3760m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    If a colon (:) is not specified, no standard modifiers
     are applied.  Then, for example, ``<Key>A'' and
     ``<Key>a'' are equivalent.

In key sequences, a circumflex (^) is an abbreviation for
the Control modifier, a dollar sign ($) is an abbreviation
for Meta, and a backslash (\) can be used to quote any char-
acter, in particular a double quote ("), a circumflex (^), a
dollar sign ($), and another backslash (\).  Briefly:


No modifiers:		 None <event> detail
Any modifiers:		 <event> detail
Only these modifiers:	 ! mod1 mod2 <event> detail
These modifiers and any others:mod1 mod2 <event> detail


The use of ``None'' for a modifier list is identical to the
use of an exclamation point with no modifers.

-----------------------------------------------------------


A key modifier is any modifier bit one of whose correspond-
ing KeyCodes contains the corresponding left or right
KeySym.	 For example, ``m'' or ``Meta'' means any modifier
bit mapping to a KeyCode whose KeySym list contains
XK_Meta_L or XK_Meta_R.	 Note that this interpretation is
for each display, not global or even for each application
context.  The Control, Shift, and Lock modifier names refer
explicitly to the corresponding modifier bits; there is no



			     1m3770m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


additional interpretation of KeySyms for these modifiers.

Because it is possible to associate arbitrary KeySyms with
modifiers, the set of key modifiers is extensible.  The
``@'' <keysym> syntax means any modifier bit whose corre-
sponding KeyCode contains the specified KeySym name.

A modifier_list/KeySym combination in a translation matches
a modifiers/KeyCode combination in an event in the following
ways:

1.   If a colon (:) is used, the Intrinsics call the dis-
     play's 4mXtKeyProc24m with the KeyCode and modifiers.  To
     match, (4mmodifiers24m & ~4mmodifiers_return24m) must equal 4mmodi-0m
     4mfier_list24m, and 4mkeysym_return24m must equal the given
     KeySym.

2.   If (:) is not used, the Intrinsics mask off all don't-
     care bits from the modifiers.  This value must be equal
     to 4mmodifier_list24m.  Then, for each possible combination
     of don't-care modifiers in the modifier list, the
     Intrinsics call the display's 4mXtKeyProc24m with the Key-
     Code and that combination ORed with the cared-about
     modifier bits from the event.  4mKeysym_return24m must match
     the KeySym in the translation.

1mEvent Types0m

The event-type field describes XEvent types.  In addition to
the standard Xlib symbolic event type names, the following
event type synonyms are defined:

-------------------------------------------------
Type		  Meaning
-------------------------------------------------
Key		  4mKeyPress0m
KeyDown		  4mKeyPress0m
KeyUp		  4mKeyRelease0m

The detail field is event-specific and normally corresponds
to the detail field of the corresponding event as described
by 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Section 11.  The detail field
is supported for the following event types:


------------------------------------------------------
Event		   Event Field
------------------------------------------------------
KeyPress	   KeySym from event 4mdetail24m (keycode)
KeyRelease	   KeySym from event 4mdetail24m (keycode)
ButtonPress	   button from event 4mdetail0m
ButtonRelease	   button from event 4mdetail0m
MotionNotify	   event 4mdetail0m
EnterNotify	   event 4mmode0m
LeaveNotify	   event 4mmode0m
FocusIn		   event 4mmode0m
FocusOut	   event 4mmode0m
PropertyNotify	   4matom0m
SelectionClear	   4mselection0m
SelectionRequest   4mselection0m
SelectionNotify	   4mselection0m
ClientMessage	   4mtype0m
MappingNotify	   4mrequest0m
------------------------------------------------------


If the event type is 4mKeyPress24m or 4mKeyRelease24m, the detail
field specifies a KeySym name in standard format which is
matched against the event as described above, for example,
<Key>A.

For the 4mPropertyNotify24m, 4mSelectionClear24m, 4mSelectionRequest24m,
4mSelectionNotify24m, and 4mClientMessage24m events the detail field
is specified as an atom name; for example, <Message>WM_PRO-
TOCOLS.	 For the 4mMotionNotify24m, 4mEnterNotify24m, 4mLeaveNotify24m,
4mFocusIn24m, 4mFocusOut24m, and 4mMappingNotify24m events, either the sym-
bolic constants as defined by 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m, Sec-
tion 11, or the numeric values may be specified.

If no detail field is specified, then any value in the event
detail is accepted as a match.

A KeySym can be specified as any of the standard KeySym
names, a hexadecimal number prefixed with ``0x'' or ``0X'',
an octal number prefixed with ``0'', or a decimal number.  A



			     1m3800m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


KeySym expressed as a single digit is interpreted as the
corresponding Latin 1 KeySym, for example, ``0'' is the
KeySym XK_0.  Other single character KeySyms are treated as
literal constants from Latin 1, for example, ``!'' is
treated as 0x21.  Standard KeySym names are as defined in
<4mX11/keysymdef.h24m> with the ``XK_'' prefix removed.


1mCanonical Representation0m

Every translation table has a unique, canonical text repre-
sentation. This representation is passed to a widget's 4mdis-0m
4mplay_accelerator24m procedure to describe the accelerators
installed on that widget.  The canonical representation of a
translation table is (see also ``Syntax'')

translationTable   = { production }
production	   = lhs ``:'' rhs ``\\n''
lhs		   = event { ``,'' event  }
event		   = [modifier_list] ``<''event_type``>'' [ ``('' count[``+''] ``)'' ] {detail}
modifier_list	   = [``!''] [``:''] {modifier}
modifier	   = [``~''] modifier_name
count		   = (``1'' | ``2'' | ``3'' | ``4'' | ...)
modifier_name	   = ``@'' <keysym> | <see canonical modifier names below>
event_type	   = <see canonical event types below>
detail		   = <event-specific details>
rhs		   = { name ``('' [params] ``)'' }
name		   = namechar { namechar }
namechar	   = { ``a''-``z'' | ``A''-``Z'' | ``0''-``9'' | ``_'' | ``-'' }
params		   = string {``,'' string}
string		   = quoted_string
quoted_string	   = ``"'' {<Latin 1 character> | escape_char} [``\\\\'' ] ``"''
escape_char	   = ``\\"''


The canonical modifier names are


     Ctrl      Mod1	      Button1
     Shift     Mod2	      Button2
     Lock      Mod3	      Button3
	       Mod4	      Button4
	       Mod5	      Button5


The canonical event types are


     4mKeyPress24m	     4mKeyRelease0m
     4mButtonPress24m	     4mButtonRelease0m
     4mMotionNotify24m	     4mEnterNotify0m

    Always put more specific events in the table before
     more general ones:


     Shift <Btn1Down> : twas()\n\
     <Btn1Down> : brillig()



    For double-click on Button1 Up with Shift, use this
     specification:


	  Shift<Btn1Up>(2) : and()


     This is equivalent to the following line with appropri-
     ate timers set between events:


	  Shift<Btn1Down>,Shift<Btn1Up>,Shift<Btn1Down>,Shift<Btn1Up> : and()


    For double-click on Button1 Down with Shift, use this
     specification:


	  Shift<Btn1Down>(2) : the()


     This is equivalent to the following line with appropri-
     ate timers set between events:


	  Shift<Btn1Down>,Shift<Btn1Up>,Shift<Btn1Down> : the()

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Mouse motion is always discarded when it occurs between
     events in a table where no motion event is specified:


	  <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up> : slithy()


     This is taken, even if the pointer moves a bit between
     the down and up events.  Similarly, any motion event
     specified in a translation matches any number of motion
     events.  If the motion event causes an action procedure
     to be invoked, the procedure is invoked after each
     motion event.

    If an event sequence consists of a sequence of events
     that is also a noninitial subsequence of another trans-
     lation, it is not taken if it occurs in the context of
     the longer sequence.  This occurs mostly in sequences
     like the following:


	  <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up> : toves()\n\
	  <Btn1Up> :  did()


     The second translation is taken only if the button
     release is not preceded by a button press or if there
     are intervening events between the press and the
     release.  Be particularly aware of this when using the
     repeat notation, above, with buttons and keys, because
     their expansion includes additional events; and when
     specifying motion events, because they are implicitly
     included between any two other events.  In particular,
     pointer motion and double-click translations cannot
     coexist in the same translation table.

    For single click on Button1 Up with Shift and Meta, use
     this specification:


	  Shift Meta <Btn1Down>, Shift Meta<Btn1Up>: gyre()


    For multiple clicks greater or equal to a minimum num-
     ber, a plus sign (+) may be appended to the final
     (rightmost) count in an event sequence.  The actions
     will be invoked on the 4mcount24m-th click and each subse-
     quent one arriving within the multi-click time inter-
     val.  For example:


	  Shift <Btn1Up>(2+) : and()

    To indicate 4mEnterNotify24m with any modifiers, use this
     specification:


	  <Enter> : gimble()


    To indicate 4mEnterNotify24m with no modifiers, use this
     specification:


	  None <Enter> : in()


    To indicate 4mEnterNotify24m with Button1 Down and Button2
     Up and ``don't care'' about the other modifiers, use
     this specification:


	  Button1 ~Button2 <Enter> : the()


    To indicate 4mEnterNotify24m with Button1 down and Button2
     down exclusively, use this specification:


	  ! Button1 Button2 <Enter> : wabe()


     You do not need to use a tilde (~) with an exclamation
     point (!).

			   1mAppendix C0m

		     1mCompatibility Functions0m




In prototype versions of the X Toolkit each widget class
implemented an Xt<4mWidget24m>Create (for example, 4mXtLabelCreate24m)
function, in which most of the code was identical from wid-
get to widget.	In the Intrinsics, a single generic 4mXtCre-0m
4mateWidget24m performs most of the common work and then calls
the initialize procedure implemented for the particular wid-
get class.

Each Composite class also implemented the procedures Xt<4mWid-0m
4mget24m>Add and an Xt<4mWidget24m>Delete (for example, 4mXtButtonBoxAd-0m
4mdButton24m and 4mXtButtonBoxDeleteButton24m).	 In the Intrinsics,
the Composite generic procedures 4mXtManageChildren24m and 4mXtUn-0m
4mmanageChildren24m perform error checking and screening out of
certain children.  Then they call the change_managed proce-
dure implemented for the widget's Composite class.  If the
widget's parent has not yet been realized, the call to the
change_managed procedure is delayed until realization time.

Old-style calls can be implemented in the X Toolkit by
defining one-line procedures or macros that invoke a generic
routine.  For example, you could define the macro 4mXtLabel-0m
4mCreate24m as:


     #define XtLabelCreate(4mname24m, 4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m) \
	     ((LabelWidget) XtCreateWidget(4mname24m, 4mlabelWidgetClass24m,   4mparent24m, 4margs24m, 4mnum_args24m))



Pop-up shells in some of the prototypes automatically per-
formed an 4mXtManageChild24m on their child within their
insert_child procedure.	 Creators of pop-up children need to
call 4mXtManageChild24m themselves.


4mXtAppInitialize24m and 4mXtVaAppInitialize24m have been replaced by
4mXtOpenApplication24m and 4mXtVaOpenApplication24m.

To initialize the Intrinsics internals, create an applica-
tion context, open and initialize a display, and create the
initial application shell instance, an application may use
4mXtAppInitialize24m or 4mXtVaAppInitialize24m.

4mXtInitialize24m calls 4mXtToolkitInitialize24m to initialize the
toolkit internals, creates a default application context for
use by the other convenience routines, calls 4mXtOpenDisplay0m
with 4mdisplay_string24m NULL and 4mapplication_name24m NULL, and
finally calls 4mXtAppCreateShell24m with 4mapplication_name24m NULL
and returns the created shell.	The semantics of calling

If no input is on the X input queue for the default applica-

If there is an event in the queue for the default applica-

nonzero value.	If no X input is on the queue, 4mXtPeekEvent0m
flushes the output buffer and blocks until input is avail-
able, possibly calling some timeout callbacks in the
process.  If the input is an event, 4mXtPeekEvent24m fills in the
event and returns a nonzero value.  Otherwise, the input is
for an alternate input source, and 4mXtPeekEvent24m returns zero.

The 4mXtAddInput24m function registers in the default application
context a new source of events, which is usually file input
but can also be file output.  (The word 4mfile24m should be
loosely interpreted to mean any sink or source of data.)
4mXtAddInput24m also specifies the conditions under which the
source can generate events.  When input is pending on this
source in the default application context, the callback pro-
cedure is called.  This routine has been replaced by 4mXtAp-0m
4mpAddInput24m.	 4mXtInitialize24m must be called before using this
routine.

1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


    Check to see that the number of arguments passed is
     correct.

    Attempt the type conversion.

    If successful, return the size and pointer to the data
     in the 4mto24m argument; otherwise, call 4mXtWarningMsg24m and
     return without modifying the 4mto24m argument.

Most type converters just take the data described by the
specified 4mfrom24m argument and return data by writing into the
specified 4mto24m argument.  A few need other information, which
is available in the specified argument list.  A type con-
verter can invoke another type converter, which allows dif-
fering sources that may convert into a common intermediate
result to make maximum use of the type converter cache.

Note that the address returned in 4mto->addr24m cannot be that of
a local variable of the converter because this is not valid
after the converter returns.  It should be a pointer to a
static variable.

The procedure type 4mXtConverter24m has been replaced by 4mXtType-0m
4mConverter24m.


The 4mXtStringConversionWarning24m function is a convenience rou-

      String 4msrc24m, 4mdst_type24m;


4msrc24m       Specifies the string that could not be converted.

4mdst_type24m  Specifies the name of the type to which the string
	  could not be converted.

The 4mXtStringConversionWarning24m function issues a warning mes-
sage with name ``conversionError'', type ``string'', class
``XtToolkitError, and the default message string ``Cannot
convert "4msrc24m" to type 4mdst_type24m''.  This routine has been
superseded by 4mXtDisplayStringConversionWarning24m.

The 4mXtConvert24m function looks up the type converter regis-
tered to convert 4mfrom_type24m to 4mto_type24m, computes any addi-
tional arguments needed, and then calls 4mXtDirectConvert24m or
4mXtCallConverter24m.  The 4mXtDirectConvert24m function looks in the
converter cache to see if this conversion procedure has been
called with the specified arguments.  If so, it returns a
descriptor for information stored in the cache; otherwise,
it calls the converter and enters the result in the cache.

Before calling the specified converter, 4mXtDirectConvert24m sets
the return value size to zero and the return value address
to NULL.  To determine if the conversion was successful, the



			     1m3960m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


client should check 4mto_return.addr24m for non-NULL.  The data
returned by 4mXtConvert24m must be copied immediately by the
caller, as it may point to static data in the type con-
verter.

4mXtConvert24m has been replaced by 4mXtConvertAndStore24m, and 4mXtDi-0m

	  shared GC was created.  Must be of class Object or
	  any subclass thereof.

4mgc24m	       Specifies the shared GC to be deallocated.

References to sharable GCs are counted and a free request is
generated to the server when the last user of a given GC
destroys it.  Note that some earlier versions of 4mXtDestroyGC0m
had only a 4mgc24m argument.  Therefore, this function is not
very portable, and you are encouraged to use 4mXtReleaseGC0m
instead.

The 4mXtGetErrorDatabaseText24m returns the appropriate message
from the error database associated with the default applica-
tion context or returns the specified default message if one
is not found in the error database.  To form the full
resource name and class when querying the database, the 4mname0m
and 4mtype24m are concatenated with a single ``.''  between them
and the 4mclass24m is concatenated with itself with a single
``.'' if it does not already contain a ``.''.  This routine

	     1mResource Configuration Management0m



Setting and changing resources in X applications can be dif-
ficult for both the application programmer and the end user.
1mResource Configuration Management (RCM) 22maddresses this prob-
lem by changing the 1mX Intrinsics 22mto immediately modify a
resource for a specified widget and each child widget in the
hierarchy.  In this context, immediate means: no sourcing of
a resource file is required; the application does not need
to be restarted for the new resource values to take effect;
and the change occurs immediately.

The main difference between 1mRCM 22mand the 1mEditres 22mprotocol is
that the 1mRCM 22mcustomizing hooks reside in the 1mIntrinsics 22mand
thus are linked with other toolkits such as Motif and the
Athena widgets.	 However, the 1mEditRes 22mprotocol requires the
application to link with the 1mEditRes 22mroutines in the Xmu
library and Xmu is not used by all applications that use
Motif.	Also, the 1mEditRes 22mprotocol uses ClientMessage,
whereas the 1mRCM Intrinsics 22mhooks use 1mPropertyNotify 22mevents.

X Properties and the 1mPropertyNotify 22mevents are used to
implement 1mRCM 22mand allow on-the-fly resource customization.
When the X Toolkit is initialized, two atoms are interned
with the strings 4mCustom24m 4mInit24m and 4mCustom24m 4mData24m.  Both 4m_XtCre-0m
4matePopupShell24m and 4m_XtAppCreateShell24m register a 1mPropertyNo-0m
1mtify 22mevent handler to handle these properties.

A customization tool uses the 4mCustom24m 4mInit24m property to 4mping0m
an application to get the application's toplevel window.
When the application's property notify event handler is
invoked, the handler deletes the property.  No data is
transferred in this property.

A customization tool uses the 4mCustom24m 4mData24m property to tell
an application that it should change a resource's value.
The data in the property contains the length of the resource
name (the number of bytes in the resource name), the
resource name and the new value for the resource.  This
property's type is 1mXA_STRING 22mand the format of the string
is:

1.   The length of the resource name (the number of bytes in
     the resource name)

2.   One space character





			     1m4220m





1mX Toolkit Intrinsics			       X11 Release 6.40m


3.   The resource name

4.   One space character

5.   The resource value

When setting the application's resource, the event handler
calls functions to walk the application's widget tree,
determining which widgets are affected by the resource
string, and then applying the value with 4mXtSetValues.24m As the
widget tree is recursively descended, at each level in the
widget tree a resource part is tested for a match.  When the
entire resource string has been matched, the value is
applied to the widget or widgets.

Before a value is set on a widget, it is first determined if
the last part of the resource is a valid resource for that
widget.	 It must also add the resource to the application's
resource database and then query it using specific resource
strings that is builds from the widget information.
