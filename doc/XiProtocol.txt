1m1.1.	Input Extension Overview0m

This document defines an extension to the X11 protocol to
support input devices other than the core X keyboard and
pointer.  An accompanying document defines a corresponding
extension to Xlib (similar extensions for languages other
than C are anticipated).  This first section gives an over-
view of the input extension.  The next section defines the
new protocol requests defined by the extension.	 We conclude
with a description of the new input events generated by the
additional input devices.

1m1.2.	Design Approach0m

The design approach of the extension is to define requests
and events analogous to the core requests and events. This
allows extension input devices to be individually distin-
guishable from each other and from the core input devices.
These requests and events make use of a device identifier
and support the reporting of n-dimensional motion data as
well as other data that is not reportable via the core input
events.

1m1.3.	Core Input Devices0m

The X server core protocol supports two input devices:	a
pointer and a keyboard.	 The pointer device has two major
functions.  First, it may be used to generate motion infor-
mation that client programs can detect. Second, it may also
be used to indicate the current location and focus of the X
keyboard.  To accomplish this, the server echoes a cursor at
the current position of the X pointer.	Unless the X key-
board has been explicitly focused, this cursor also shows
the current location and focus of the X keyboard.

The X keyboard is used to generate input that client pro-
grams can detect.

The X keyboard and X pointer are referred to in this docu-
ment as the 4mcore24m 4mdevices24m, and the input events they generate
(1mKeyPress22m, 1mKeyRelease22m, 1mButtonPress22m, 1mButtonRelease22m, and
1mMotionNotify22m) are known as the 4mcore24m 4minput24m 4mevents24m.  All other
input devices are referred to as 4mextension24m 4minput24m 4mdevices24m and
the input events they generate are referred to as 4mextension0m
4minput24m 4mevents24m.

			    Note

     This input extension does not change the behavior
     or functionality of the core input devices, core
     events, or core protocol requests, with the excep-
     tion of the core grab requests.  These requests
     may affect the synchronization of events from
     extension devices.	 See the explanation in the



			      1m10m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


     section titled "Event Synchronization and Core
     Grabs".


Selection of the physical devices to be initially used by
the server as the core devices is left implementation-depen-
dent.  Requests are defined that allow client programs to
change which physical devices are used as the core devices.

1m1.4.	Extension Input Devices0m

The input extension controls access to input devices other
than the X keyboard and X pointer.  It allows client pro-
grams to select input from these devices independently from
each other and independently from the core devices.

A client that wishes to access a specific device must first
determine whether that device is connected to the X server.
This is done through the 1mListInputDevices 22mrequest, which
will return a list of all devices that can be opened by the
X server.  A client can then open one or more of these
devices using the 1mOpenDevice 22mrequest, specify what events
they are interested in receiving, and receive and process
input events from extension devices in the same way as
events from the X keyboard and X pointer.  Input events from
these devices are of extension types (1mDeviceKeyPress22m,
1mDeviceKeyRelease22m, 1mDeviceButtonPress22m, 1mDeviceButtonRelease22m,
1mDeviceMotionNotify22m, etc.) and contain a device identifier so
that events of the same type coming from different input
devices can be distinguished.

Any kind of input device may be used as an extension input
device.	 Extension input devices may have 0 or more keys, 0
or more buttons, and may report 0 or more axes of motion.
Motion may be reported as relative movements from a previous
position or as an absolute position.  All valuators report-
ing motion information for a given extension input device
must report the same kind of motion information (absolute or
relative).

This extension is designed to accommodate new types of input
devices that may be added in the future.  The protocol
requests that refer to specific characteristics of input
devices organize that information by 1minput classes22m.  Server
implementors may add new classes of input devices without
changing the protocol requests.	 Input classes are unique
numbers registered with the X Consortium.  Each extension
input device may support multiple input classes.

All extension input devices are treated like the core X key-
board in determining their location and focus.	The server
does not track the location of these devices on an individ-
ual basis, and therefore does not echo a cursor to indicate
their current location.	 Instead, their location is



			      1m20m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


determined by the location of the core X pointer.  Like the
core X keyboard, some may be explicitly focused. If they are
not explicitly focused,	 their focus is determined by the
location of the core X pointer.

Input events reported by the server to a client are of fixed
size (32 bytes).  In order to represent the change in state
of an input device the extension may need to generate a
sequence of input events.  A client side library (such as
Xlib) will typically take these raw input events and format
them into a form more convenient to the client.

1m1.4.1.  Event Classes0m

In the core protocol a client registers interest in receiv-
ing certain input events directed to a window by modifying
that window's event-mask.  Most of the bits in the event
mask are already used to specify interest in core X events.
The input extension specifies a different mechanism by which
a client can express interest in events generated by this
extension.

When a client opens a extension input device via the 1mOpenDe-0m
1mvice 22mrequest, an 1mXDevice 22mstructure is returned.  Macros are
provided that extract 32-bit numbers called 1mevent classes0m
from that structure, that a client can use to register
interest in extension events via the 1mSelectExtensionEvent0m
request.  The event class combines the desired event type
and device id, and may be thought of as the equivalent of
core event masks.

1m1.4.2.  Input Classes0m

Some of the input extension requests divide input devices
into classes based on their functionality.  This is intended
to allow new classes of input devices to be defined at a
later time without changing the semantics of these requests.
The following input device classes are currently defined:

     1mKEY  22mThe device reports key events.

     1mBUTTON0m
	  The device reports button events.

     1mVALUATOR0m
	  The device reports valuator data in motion events.

     1mPROXIMITY0m
	  The device reports proximity events.

     1mFOCUS0m
	  The device can be focused and reports focus
	  events.




			      1m30m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


     1mFEEDBACK0m
	  The device supports feedbacks.

     1mOTHER0m
	  The 1mChangeDeviceNotify22m, 1mDeviceMappingNotify22m, and
	  1mDeviceStateNotify 22mmacros may be invoked passing
	  the 1mXDevice 22mstructure returned for this device.

Each extension input device may support multiple input
classes.  Additional classes may be added in the future.
Requests that support multiple input classes, such as the
1mListInputDevices 22mfunction that lists all available input
devices, organize the data they return by input class.
Client programs that use these requests should not access
data unless it matches a class defined at the time those
clients were compiled.	In this way, new classes can be
added without forcing existing clients that use these
requests to be recompiled.

1m2.  Requests0m

Extension input devices are accessed by client programs
through the use of new protocol requests.  This section sum-
marizes the new requests defined by this extension.  The
syntax and type definitions used below follow the notation
used for the X11 core protocol.

1m2.1.	Getting the Extension Version0m

The 1mGetExtensionVersion 22mrequest returns version information
about the input extension.

GetExtensionVersion
     name: STRING
=>
     present: BOOL
     protocol-major-version: CARD16
     protocol-minor-version: CARD16

     The protocol version numbers returned indicate the ver-
     sion of the input extension supported by the target X
     server.  The version numbers can be compared to con-
     stants defined in the header file 1mXI.h22m.  Each version
     is a superset of the previous versions.

1m2.2.	Listing Available Devices0m

A client that wishes to access a specific device must first
determine whether that device is connected to the X server.
This is done through the 1mListInputDevices 22mrequest, which
will return a list of all devices that can be opened by the
X server.

This request returns a list of all devices that can be
opened by the X server, including the core X keyboard and X
pointer.  Some implementations may open all input devices as
part of X initialization, while others may not open an input
device until requested to do so by a client program.


  The information returned for each device is as follows:

The 1mtype 22mfield is of type 1mAtom 22mand indicates the nature of
the device.  Clients may determine device types by invoking
the 1mXInternAtom 22mrequest passing one of the names defined in
the header file 1mXI.h22m.  The following names have been defined
to date:

The 1mid 22mis a small cardinal value in the range 0-128 that
uniquely identifies the device.	 It is assigned to the
device when it is initialized by the server.  Some implemen-
tations may not open an input device until requested by a
client program, and may close the device when the last
client accessing it requests that it be closed.	 If a device
is opened by a client program via 1mXOpenDevice22m, then closed
via 1mXCloseDevice22m, then opened again, it is not guaranteed to
have the same id after the second open request.

The 1mnum_classes 22mfield is a small cardinal value in the range
0-255 that specifies the number of input classes supported
by the device for which information is returned by 1mListIn-0m
1mputDevices22m.  Some input classes, such as class 1mFocus 22mand
class 1mProximity 22mdo not have any information to be returned
by 1mListInputDevices22m.

The 1muse 22mfield specifies how the device is currently being
used.  If the value is 1mIsXKeyboard22m, the device is currently
being used as the X keyboard.  If the value is 1mIsXPointer22m,
the device is currently being used as the X pointer.  If the
value is 1mIsXExtensionDevice22m, the device is available for use
as an extension device.

The 1mname 22mfield contains a pointer to a null-terminated
string that corresponds to one of the defined device types.

  1mInputInfo 22mis one of: 1mKeyInfo22m, 1mButtonInfo 22mor 1mValuatorInfo22m.
   The first two fields are common to all three:

The 1mclass 22mfield is a cardinal value in the range 0-255.  It
uniquely identifies the class of input for which information
is returned.




			      1m60m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


The 1mlength 22mfield is a cardinal value in the range 0-255.  It
specifies the number of bytes of data that are contained in
this input class.  The length includes the class and length
fields.

The remaining information returned for input class 1mKEYCLASS0m
is as follows:

1mmin_keycode 22mis of type KEYCODE.  It specifies the minimum
keycode that the device will report.  The minimum keycode
will not be smaller than 8.

1mmax_keycode 22mis of type KEYCODE.  It specifies the maximum
keycode that the device will report.  The maximum keycode
will not be larger than 255.

1mnum_keys 22mis a cardinal value that specifies the number of
keys that the device has.

The remaining information returned for input class 1mBUTTON-0m
1mCLASS 22mis as follows:

1mnum_buttons 22mis a cardinal value that specifies the number of
buttons that the device has.

The remaining information returned for input class 1mVALUATOR-0m
1mCLASS 22mis as follows:

1mmode 22mis a constant that has one of the following values:
1mAbsolute 22mor 1mRelative22m.	 Some devices allow the mode to be
changed dynamically via the 1mSetDeviceMode 22mrequest.

1mmotion_buffer_size 22mis a cardinal number that specifies the
number of elements that can be contained in the motion his-
tory buffer for the device.

The 1maxes 22mfield contains a pointer to an AXISINFO struture.

  The information returned for each axis reported by the
   device is:

The 1mresolution 22mis a cardinal value in counts/meter.

The 1mmin_val 22mfield is a cardinal value in that contains the
minimum value the device reports for this axis.	 For devices
whose mode is 1mRelative22m, the min_val field will contain 0.

The 1mmax_val 22mfield is a cardinal value in that contains the
maximum value the device reports for this axis.	 For devices
whose mode is 1mRelative22m, the max_val field will contain 0.

1m2.3.	Enabling Devices0m

Client programs that wish to access an extension device must
request that the server open that device.  This is done via
the 1mOpenDevice 22mrequest.

OpenDevice
     id: CARD8
=>

     DEVICE:	       [device_id: XID
			num_classes: INT32
			classes: LISTofINPUTCLASSINFO]

     INPUTCLASSINFO:   [input_class: CARD8
			event_type_base: CARD8]


     Errors: Device


This request returns the event classes to be used by the
client to indicate which events the client program wishes to
receive.  Each input class may report several event classes.
For example, input class 1mKeys 22mreports 1mDeviceKeyPress 22mand
1mDeviceKeyRelease 22mevent classes.  Input classes are unique
numbers registered with the X Consortium.  Input class 1mOther0m
exists to report event classes that are not specific to any
one input class, such as 1mDeviceMappingNotify22m, 1mChangeDevi-0m
1mceNotify22m, and 1mDeviceStateNotify22m.


  The information returned for each device is as follows:

The 1mdevice_id 22mis a number that uniquely identifies the
device.

The 1mnum_classes 22mfield contains the number of input classes
supported by this device.


  For each class of input supported by the device, the
   1mInputClassInfo 22mstructure contains the following informa-
   tion:

The 1minput_class 22mis a small cardinal number that identifies
the class of input.

The 1mevent_type_base 22mis a small cardinal number that speci-
fies the event type of one of the events reported by this
input class.  This information is not directly used by
client programs.  Instead, the 1mDevice 22mis used by macros that
return extension event types and event classes.	 This is
described in the section of this document entitled



			      1m80m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


"Selecting Extension Device Events".

Before it exits, the client program should explicitly
request that the server close the device.  This is done via
the 1mCloseDevice 22mrequest.

A client may open the same extension device more than once.
Requests after the first successful one return an additional
1mXDevice 22mstructure with the same information as the first,
but otherwise have no effect.  A single 1mCloseDevice 22mrequest
will terminate that client's access to the device.

Closing a device releases any active or passive grabs the
requesting client has established.  If the device is frozen
only by an active grab of the requesting client, the queued
events are released when the client terminates.

If a client program terminates without closing a device, the
server will automatically close that device on behalf of the
client.	 This does not affect any other clients that may be
accessing that device.

     Errors: Device


1m2.4.	Changing The Mode Of A Device0m

Some devices are capable of reporting either relative or
absolute motion data.  To change the mode of a device from
relative to absolute, use the 1mSetDeviceMode 22mrequest.  The
valid values are 1mAbsolute 22mor 1mRelative22m.

This request will fail and return 1mDeviceBusy 22mif another
client already has the device open with a different mode.
It will fail and return 1mAlreadyGrabbed 22mif another client has
the device grabbed.  The request will fail with a 1mBadMatch0m
error if the requested mode is not supported by the device.

1m2.5.	Initializing Valuators on an Input Device0m

Some devices that report absolute positional data can be
initialized to a starting value.  Devices that are capable
of reporting relative motion or absolute positional data may
require that their valuators be initialized to a starting
value after the mode of the device is changed to 1mAbsolute22m.
To initialize the valuators on such a device, use the 1mSetDe-0m
1mviceValuators 22mrequest.

SetDeviceValuators
     device: DEVICE
     first_valuator: CARD8
     num_valuators: CARD8
     valuators: LISTOFINT32

     Errors: Length, Device, Match, Value

=>
     status: {Success, AlreadyGrabbed}


This request initializes the specified valuators on the
specified extension input device.  Valuators are numbered
beginning with zero.  Only the valuators in the range speci-
fied by first_valuator and num_valuators are set.  If the
number of valuators supported by the device is less than the
expression first_valuator + num_valuators, a 1mValue 22merror
will result.

If the request succeeds, 1mSuccess 22mis returned.  If the
specifed device is grabbed by some other client, the request
will fail and a status of 1mAlreadyGrabbed 22mwill be returned.

1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


This request returns the current state of the specified
device control.	 The device control must be supported by the
target server and device or an error will result.

If the request is successful, a pointer to a generic
DeviceState structure will be returned.	 The information
returned varies according to the specified control and is
mapped by a structure appropriate for that control.

GetDeviceControl will fail with a BadValue error if the
server does not support the specified control.	It will fail
with a BadMatch error if the device does not support the
specified control.

Supported device controls and the information returned for
them include:


DEVICE_RESOLUTION:   [control: CARD16
		      length: CARD16
		      num_valuators: CARD8
		      resolutions: LISTofCARD32
		      min_resolutions: LISTofCARD32
		      max_resolutions: LISTofCARD32]


This device control returns a list of valuators and the
range of valid resolutions allowed for each.  Valuators are
numbered beginning with 0.  Resolutions for all valuators on
the device are returned.  For each valuator i on the device,
resolutions[i] returns the current setting of the resolu-
tion, min_resolutions[i] returns the minimum valid setting,
and max_resolutions[i] returns the maximum valid setting.

When this control is specified, XGetDeviceControl will fail
with a BadMatch error if the specified device has no valua-
tors.

ChangeDeviceControl changes the specifed device control
according to the values specified in the DeviceControl
structure.  The device control must be supported by the tar-
get server and device or an error will result.

The information passed with this request varies according to
the specified control and is mapped by a structure appropri-
ate for that control.

ChangeDeviceControl will fail with a BadValue error if the
server does not support the specified control.	It will fail
with a BadMatch error if the server supports the specified
control, but the requested device does not.  The request
will fail and return a status of DeviceBusy if another
client already has the device open with a device control
state that conflicts with the one specified in the request.
It will fail with a status of AlreadyGrabbed if some other
client has grabbed the specified device.  If the request
succeeds, Success is returned.	If it fails, the device con-
trol is left unchanged.

Supported device controls and the information specified for
them include:


DEVICE_RESOLUTION:   [control: CARD16
		      length: CARD16
		      first_valuator: CARD8
		      num_valuators: CARD8
		      resolutions: LISTofCARD32]


This device control changes the resolution of the specified
valuators on the specified extension input device.  Valua-
tors are numbered beginning with zero.	Only the valuators
in the range specified by first_valuator and num_valuators
are set.  A value of -1 in the resolutions list indicates
that the resolution for this valuator is not to be changed.
num_valuators specifies the number of valuators in the reso-
lutions list.

When this control is specified, XChangeDeviceControl will
fail with a BadMatch error if the specified device has no
valuators.  If a resolution is specified that is not within
the range of valid values (as returned by XGetDeviceControl)
the request will fail with a BadValue error.  If the number
of valuators supported by the device is less than the
expression first_valuator + num_valuators, a BadValue error
will result.

If the request fails for any reason, none of the valuator
resolutions will be changed.

1m2.7.	Selecting Extension Device Events0m

Extension input events are selected using the 1mSelectExten-0m
1msionEvent 22mrequest.

SelectExtensionEvent
     window: WINDOW

     Errors: Window, Class, Access


This request specifies to the server the events within the
specified window which are of interest to the client.  As
with the core 1mXSelectInput 22mfunction, multiple clients can
select input on the same window.

1mXSelectExtensionEvent 22mrequires a list of 4mevent24m 4mclasses24m.	An
event class is a 32-bit number that combines an event type
and device id, and is used to indicate which event a client
wishes to receive and from which device it wishes to receive
it.  Macros are provided to obtain event classes from the
data returned by the 1mXOpenDevice 22mrequest.	The names of
these macros correspond to the desired events, i.e. the
1mDeviceKeyPress 22mis used to obtain the event class for
1mDeviceKeyPress 22mevents.  The syntax of the macro invocation
is:

DeviceKeyPress (device, event_type, event_class);
     device: DEVICE
     event_type: INT
     event_class: INT

The value returned in 1mevent_type 22mis the value that will be
contained in the event type field of the 1mXDeviceKeyPressEv-0m
1ment 22mwhen it is received by the client.  The value returned
in 1mevent_class 22mis the value that should be passed in making
an 1mXSelectExtensionEvent 22mrequest to receive 1mDeviceKeyPress0m
events.

For 1mDeviceButtonPress 22mevents, the client may specify whether
or not an implicit passive grab should be done when the but-
ton is pressed.	 If the client wants to guarantee that it
will receive a 1mDeviceButtonRelease 22mevent for each 1mDeviceBut-0m
1mtonPress 22mevent it receives, it should specify the 1mDeviceBut-0m
1mtonPressGrab 22mevent class as well as the 1mDeviceButtonPress0m
event class.  This restricts the client in that only one
client at a time may request 1mDeviceButtonPress 22mevents from
the same device and window if any client specifies this
class.

If any client has specified the 1mDeviceButtonPressGrab 22mclass,
any requests by any other client that specify the same
device and window and specify 1mDeviceButtonPress 22mor



			     1m130m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


1mDeviceButtonPressGrab 22mwill cause an 1mAccess 22merror to be gen-
erated.

If only the 1mDeviceButtonPress 22mclass is specified, no
implicit passive grab will be done when a button is pressed
on the device.	Multiple clients may use this class to spec-
ify the same device and window combination.

A client may also specify the 1mDeviceOwnerGrabButton 22mclass.
If it has specified both the 1mDeviceButtonPressGrab 22mand the
1mDeviceOwnerGrabButton 22mclasses, implicit passive grabs will
activate with owner_events set to 1mTrue22m.  If only the 1mDevice-0m
1mButtonPressGrab 22mclass is specified, implicit passive grabs
will activate with owner_events set to 1mFalse22m.

The client may select 1mDeviceMotion 22mevents only when a button
is down.  It does this by specifying the event classes 1mBut-0m
1mton1Motion 22mthrough 1mButton5Motion22m, or 1mButtonMotion22m.  An input
device will only support as many button motion classes as it
has buttons.

1m2.8.	Determining Selected Events0m

To determine which extension events are currently selected
from a given window, use 1mGetSelectedExtensionEvents22m.

GetSelectedExtensionEvents
     window: WINDOW
=>
     this-client: LISTofEVENTCLASS
     all-clients: LISTofEVENTCLASS

     Errors: Window


This request returns two lists specifying the events
selected on the specified window.  One list gives the exten-
sion events selected by this client from the specified win-
dow.  The other list gives the extension events selected by
all clients from the specified window.	This information is
equivalent to that returned by your-event-mask and all-
event-masks in a 1mGetWindowAttributes 22mrequest.

1m2.9.	Controlling Event Propagation0m

Extension events propagate up the window hierarchy in the
same manner as core events.  If a window is not interested
in an extension event, it usually propagates to the closest
ancestor that is interested, unless the dont_propagate list
prohibits it.  Grabs of extension devices may alter the set
of windows that receive a particular extension event.

Client programs may control extension event propagation
through the use of the following two requests.



			     1m140m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


1mXChangeDeviceDontPropagateList 22madds an event to or deletes
an event from the do_not_propagate list of extension events
for the specified window.  This list is maintained for the
life of the window, and is not altered if the client termi-
nates.


ChangeDeviceDontPropagateList
     window: WINDOW
     eventclass: LISTofEVENTCLASS
     mode: {AddToList, DeleteFromList}

     Errors: Window, Class, Mode


This function modifies the list specifying the events that
are not propagated to the ancestors of the specified window.
You may use the modes 1mAddToList 22mor 1mDeleteFromList22m.

GetDeviceDontPropagateList
     window: WINDOW

     Errors: Window
=>
     dont-propagate-list: LISTofEVENTCLASS



This function returns a list specifying the events that are
not propagated to the ancestors of the specified window.

1m2.10.	 Sending Extension Events0m

One client program may send an event to another via the
1mXSendExtensionEvent 22mfunction.

The event in the 1mXEvent 22mstructure must be one of the events
defined by the input extension, so that the X server can
correctly byte swap the contents as necessary.	The contents
of the event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X
server except to force send_event to 1mTrue 22min the forwarded
event and to set the sequence number in the event correctly.

XSendExtensionEvent returns zero if the conversion-to-wire
protocol failed, otherwise it returns nonzero.

where

     DEVICETIMECOORD:	[data:LISTofINT32  time:TIMESTAMP]


     Errors: Device, Match


This request returns all positions in the device's motion
history buffer that fall between the specified start and
stop times inclusive.  If the start time is in the future,
or is later than the stop time, no positions are returned.

The data field of the DEVICETIMECOORD structure is a
sequence of data items.	 Each item is of type INT32, and
there is one data item per axis of motion reported by the
device.	 The number of axes reported by the device is
returned in the axis_count variable.

The value of the data items depends on the mode of the
device, which is returned in the mode variable.	 If the mode
is Absolute, the data items are the raw values generated by
the device.  These may be scaled by the client program using
the maximum values that the device can generate for each
axis of motion that it reports.	 The maximum and minimum
values for each axis are reported by the 1mListInputDevices0m
request.

If the mode is Relative, the data items are the relative
values generated by the device.	 The client program must
choose an initial position for the device and maintain a
current position by accumulating these relative values.

1m2.12.	 Changing The Core Devices0m

These requests are provided to change which physical device
is used as the X pointer or X keyboard.

1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


			    Note

     Using these requests may change the characteris-
     tics of the core devices.	The new pointer device
     may have a different number of buttons than the
     old one did, or the new keyboard device may have a
     different number of keys or report a different
     range of keycodes.	 Client programs may be running
     that depend on those characteristics.  For exam-
     ple, a client program could allocate an array
     based on the number of buttons on the pointer
     device, and then use the button numbers received
     in button events as indicies into that array.
     Changing the core devices could cause such client
     programs to behave improperly or abnormally termi-
     nate.


These requests change the X keyboard or X pointer device and
generate an 1mChangeDeviceNotify 22mevent and a 1mMappingNotify0m
event.	The 1mChangeDeviceNotify 22mevent is sent only to those
clients that have expressed an interest in receiving that
event via the 1mXSelectExtensionEvent 22mrequest.  The specified
device becomes the new X keyboard or X pointer device.	The
location of the core device does not change as a result of
this request.

These requests fail and return 1mAlreadyGrabbed 22mif either the
specified device or the core device it would replace are
grabbed by some other client.  They fail and return
1mGrabFrozen 22mif either device is frozen by the active grab of
another client.

These requests fail with a 1mBadDevice 22merror if the specified
device is invalid, or has not previously been opened via
1mOpenDevice22m.


To change the X keyboard device, use the 1mChangeKeyboardDe-0m
1mvice 22mrequest.  The specified device must support input class
Keys (as reported in the ListInputDevices request) or the
request will fail with a 1mBadMatch 22merror.  Once the device
has successfully replaced one of the core devices, it is
treated as a core device until it is in turn replaced by
another ChangeDevice request, or until the server termi-
nates.	The termination of the client that changed  the
device will not cause it to change back.  Attempts to use
the CloseDevice request to close the new core device will
fail with a BadDevice error.

The focus state of the new keyboard is the same as the focus
state of the old X keyboard.  If the new keyboard was not
initialized with a 1mFocusRec22m, one is added by the 1mChangeKey-0m
1mboardDevice 22mrequest.  The X keyboard is assumed to have a



			     1m170m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


1mKbdFeedbackClassRec22m.  If the device was initialized without
a 1mKbdFeedbackClassRec22m, one will be added by this request.
The 1mKbdFeedbackClassRec 22mwill specify a null routine as the
control procedure and the bell procedure.

ChangeKeyboardDevice
     device: DEVICE

     Errors: Device, Match
=>
     status: Success, AlreadyGrabbed, Frozen


To change the X pointer device, use the 1mChangePointerDevice0m
request.  The specified device must support input class Val-
uators (as reported in the ListInputDevices request) or the
request will fail with a BadMatch error.  The valuators to
be used as the x- and y-axes of the pointer device must be
specified.  Data from other valuators on the device will be
ignored.

The X pointer device does not contain a 1mFocusRec22m.	If the
new pointer was initialized with a 1mFocusRec22m, it is freed by
the 1mChangePointerDevice 22mrequest.  The X pointer is assumed
to have a 1mButtonClassRec 22mand a 1mPtrFeedbackClassRec22m.  If the
device was initialized without a 1mButtonClassRec 22mor a 1mPtr-0m
1mFeedbackClassRec22m, one will be added by this request.  The
1mButtonClassRec 22madded will have no buttons, and the 1mPtrFeed-0m
1mbackClassRec 22mwill specify a null routine as the control pro-
cedure.

If the specified device reports absolute positional informa-
tion, and the server implementation does not allow such a
device to be used as the X pointer, the request will fail
with a 1mBadDevice 22merror.

Once the device has successfully replaced one of the core
devices, it is treated as a core device until it is in turn
replaced by another ChangeDevice request, or until the
server terminates.  The termination of the client that
changed	 the device will not cause it to change back.
Attempts to use the CloseDevice request to close the new
core device will fail with a BadDevice error.

1m2.13.	 Event Synchronization And Core Grabs0m

Implementation of the input extension requires an extension
of the meaning of event synchronization for the core grab
requests.  This is necessary in order to allow window man-
agers to freeze all input devices with a single request.

The core grab requests require a 1mpointer_mode 22mand 1mkey-0m
1mboard_mode 22margument.  The meaning of these modes is changed
by the input extension.	 For the 1mXGrabPointer 22mand 1mXGrabBut-0m
1mton 22mrequests, 1mpointer_mode 22mcontrols synchronization of the
pointer device, and 1mkeyboard_mode 22mcontrols the synchroniza-
tion of all other input devices.  For the 1mXGrabKeyboard 22mand
1mXGrabKey 22mrequests, 1mpointer_mode 22mcontrols the synchronization
of all input devices except the X keyboard, while 1mkey-0m
1mboard_mode 22mcontrols the synchronization of the keyboard.
When using one of the core grab requests, the synchroniza-
tion of extension devices is controlled by the mode speci-
fied for the device not being grabbed.

1m2.14.	 Extension Active Grabs0m

Active grabs of extension devices are supported via the
1mGrabDevice 22mrequest in the same way that core devices are
grabbed using the core GrabKeyboard request, except that a
4mDevice24m is passed as a function parameter.	A list of events
that the client wishes to receive is also passed.  The
1mUngrabDevice 22mrequest allows a previous active grab for an
extension device to be released.

To grab an extension device, use the 1mGrabDevice 22mrequest.
The device must have previously been opened using the 1mOpen-0m
1mDevice 22mrequest.

     Errors:  Device, Window, Value


This request actively grabs control of the specified input
device.	 Further input events from this device are reported
only to the grabbing client.  This request overrides any
previous active grab by this client for this device.




			     1m190m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


The event-list parameter is a pointer to a list of event
classes.  These are used to indicate which events the client
wishes to receive while the device is grabbed.	Only event
classes obtained from the grabbed device are valid.

If owner-events is 1mFalse22m, input events generated from this
device are reported with respect to grab-window, and are
only reported if selected by being included in the event-
list.  If owner-events is 1mTrue22m, then if a generated event
would normally be reported to this client, it is reported
normally, otherwise the event is reported with respect to
the grab-window, and is only reported if selected by being
included in the event-list.  For either value of owner-
events, unreported events are discarded.

If this-device-mode is 1mAsynchronous22m, device event processing
continues normally.  If the device is currently frozen by
this client, then processing of device events is resumed.
If this-device-mode is 1mSynchronous22m, the state of the grabbed
device (as seen by means of the protocol) appears to freeze,
and no further device events are generated by the server
until the grabbing client issues a releasing 1mAllowDe-0m
1mviceEvents 22mrequest or until the device grab is released.
Actual device input events are not lost while the device is
frozen; they are simply queued for later processing.

If other-device-mode is 1mAsynchronous22m, event processing is
unaffected by activation of the grab.  If other-device-mode
is 1mSynchronous22m, the state of all input devices except the
grabbed one (as seen by means of the protocol) appears to
freeze, and no further events are generated by the server
until the grabbing client issues a releasing 1mAllowDe-0m
1mviceEvents 22mrequest or until the device grab is released.
Actual events are not lost while the devices are frozen;
they are simply queued for later processing.

This request generates 1mDeviceFocusIn 22mand 1mDeviceFocusOut0m
events.

This request fails and returns:

  1mAlreadyGrabbed 22mIf the device is actively grabbed by some
   other client.

  1mNotViewable 22mIf grab-window is not viewable.

  1mInvalidTime 22mIf the specified time is earlier than the
   last-grab-time for the specified device or later than the
   current X server time. Otherwise, the last-grab-time for
   the specified device is set to the specified time and
   1mCurrentTime 22mis replaced by the current X server time.

  1mFrozen 22mIf the device is frozen by an active grab of
   another client.

If a grabbed device is closed by a client while an active
grab by that client is in effect, that active grab will be
released.  Any passive grabs established by that client will
be released.  If the device is frozen only by an active grab
of the requesting client, it is thawed.

To release a grab of an extension device, use 1mUngrabDevice22m.

UngrabDevice
     device: DEVICE
     time: TIMESTAMP or CurrentTime

     Errors:  Device


This request releases the device if this client has it
actively grabbed (from either 1mGrabDevice 22mor 1mGrabDeviceKey22m)
and releases any queued events.	 If any devices were frozen
by the grab, 1mUngrabDevice 22mthaws them.  The request has no
effect if the specified time is earlier than the last-
device-grab time or is later than the current server time.

This request generates 1mDeviceFocusIn 22mand 1mDeviceFocusOut0m
events.

An 1mUngrabDevice 22mis performed automatically if the event win-
dow for an active device grab becomes not viewable.

1m2.15.	 Passively Grabbing A Key0m

Passive grabs of buttons and keys on extension devices are
supported via the 1mGrabDeviceButton 22mand 1mGrabDeviceKey0m
requests.  These passive grabs are released via the 1mUngrab-0m
1mDeviceKey 22mand 1mUngrabDeviceButton 22mrequests.

To passively grab a single key on an extension device, use
1mGrabDeviceKey22m.  That device must have previously been opened

The 1mAllowDeviceEvents 22mrequest releases some queued events if
the client has caused a device to freeze.  The request has
no effect if the specified time is earlier than the last-

grab time of the most recent active grab for the client, or
if the specified time is later than the current X server
time.

The following describes the processing that occurs depending
on what constant you pass to the event-mode argument:

  If the specified device is frozen by the client, event
   processing for that device continues as usual.  If the
   device is frozen multiple times  by the client on behalf
   of multiple separate grabs, AsyncThisDevice thaws for
   all.	 AsyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified
   device is not frozen by the client, but the device need
   not be grabbed by the client.

  If the specified device is frozen and actively grabbed by
   the client, event processing for that device continues
   normally until the next button or key event is reported
   to the client.  At this time, the specified device again
   appears to freeze.  However, if the reported event causes
   the grab to be released, the specified device does not
   freeze.  SyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified
   device is not frozen by the client or is not grabbed by
   the client.

  If the specified device is actively grabbed by the client
   and is frozen as the result of an event having been sent
   to the client (either from the activation of a GrabDe-
   viceButton or from a previous AllowDeviceEvents with mode
   SyncThisDevice, but not from a Grab), the grab is
   released and that event is completely reprocessed.  This
   time, however, the request ignores any passive grabs at
   or above (towards the root) the grab-window of the grab
   just released.  The request has no effect if the speci-
   fied device is not grabbed by the client or if it is not
   frozen as the result of an event.

  If the remaining devices are frozen by the client, event
   processing for them continues as usual.  If the other
   devices are frozen multiple times  by the client on
   behalf of multiple separate grabs, AsyncOtherDevices
   ``thaws'' for all.  AsyncOtherDevices has no effect if
   the devices are not frozen by the client, but those
   devices need not be grabbed by the client.

  If all devices are frozen by the client, event processing
   (for all devices) continues normally until the next but-
   ton or key event is reported to the client for a grabbed
   device (button event for the grabbed device, key or
   motion event for the device), at which time the devices
   again appear to freeze.  However, if the reported event
   causes the grab to be released, then the devices do not
   freeze (but if any device is still grabbed, then a subse-
   quent event for it will still cause all devices to



			     1m260m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


   freeze).  SyncAll has no effect unless all devices are
   frozen by the client.  If any device is frozen twice by
   the client on behalf of two separate grabs, SyncAll
   "thaws" for both (but a subsequent freeze for SyncAll
   will only freeze each device once).

  If all devices are frozen by the client, event processing
   (for all devices) continues normally.  If any device is
   frozen multiple times by the client on behalf of multiple
   separate grabs, AsyncAll "thaws" for all.  AsyncAll has
   no effect unless all devices are frozen by the client.

AsyncThisDevice, SyncThisDevice, and ReplayThisDevice have
no effect on the processing of events from the remaining
devices.  AsyncOtherDevices has no effect on the processing
of events from the specified device.  When the event_mode is
SyncAll or AsyncAll, the device parameter is ignored.

It is possible for several grabs of different devices (by
the same or different clients) to be active simultaneously.
If a device is frozen on behalf of any grab, no event pro-
cessing is performed for the device.  It is possible for a
single device to be frozen because of several grabs.  In
this case, the freeze must be released on behalf of each
grab before events can again be processed.


1m2.18.	 Controlling Device Focus0m

The current focus window for an extension input device can
be determined using the 1mGetDeviceFocus 22mrequest.  Extension
devices are focused using the 1mSetDeviceFocus 22mrequest in the
same way that the keyboard is focused using the 1mSetInputFo-0m
1mcus 22mrequest, except that a device is specified as part of
the request. One additional focus state, 1mFollowKeyboard22m, is
provided for extension devices.

To get the current focus state, revert state, and focus time
of an extension device, use 1mGetDeviceFocus22m.

GetDeviceFocus

     device: DEVICE
=>
     focus: WINDOW, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None
     revert-to: Parent, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None
     focus-time: TIMESTAMP

     Errors:  Device, Match


This request returns the current focus state, revert-to
state, and last-focus-time of an extension device.




			     1m270m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


To set the focus of an extension device, use 1mSetDeviceFocus22m.

SetDeviceFocus
     device: DEVICE
     focus: WINDOW, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None
     revert-to: Parent, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None
     focus-time: TIMESTAMP

     Errors:  Device, Window, Value, Match


This request changes the focus for an extension input device
and the last-focus-change-time.	 The request has no effect
if the specified time is earlier than the last-focus-change-
time or is later than the current X server time.  Otherwise,
the last-focus-change-time is set to the specified time,
with CurrentTime replaced by the current server time.

The action taken by the server when this request is
requested depends on the value of the focus argument:

  If the focus argument is 1mNone22m, all input events from this
   device will be discarded until a new focus window is set.
   In this case, the revert-to argument is ignored.

  If a window ID is assigned to the focus argument, it
   becomes the focus window of the device.  If an input
   event from the device would normally be reported to this
   window or to one of its inferiors, the event is reported
   normally.  Otherwise, the event is reported relative to
   the focus window.

  If you assign 1mPointerRoot 22mto the focus argument, the
   focus window is dynamically taken to be the root window
   of whatever screen the pointer is on at each input event.
   In this case, the revert-to argument is ignored.

  If you assign 1mFollowKeyboard 22mto the focus argument, the
   focus window is dynamically taken to be the same as the
   focus of the X keyboard at each input event.

The specified focus window must be viewable at the time of
the request (else a 1mMatch 22merror).	If the focus window later
becomes not viewable, the X server evaluates the revert-to
argument to determine the new focus window.

  If you assign 1mRevertToParent 22mto the revert-to argument,
   the focus reverts to the parent (or the closest viewable
   ancestor), and the new revert-to value is taken to be
   1mRevertToNone22m.

  If you assign 1mRevertToPointerRoot22m, 1mRevertToFollowKey-0m
   1mboard22m, or 1mRevertToNone 22mto the revert-to argument, the
   focus reverts to that value.



			     1m280m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


When the focus reverts, the X server generates 1mDeviceFocusIn0m
and 1mDeviceFocusOut 22mevents, but the last-focus-change time is
not affected.

This request causes the X server to generate 1mDeviceFocusIn0m
and 1mDeviceFocusOut 22mevents.

1m2.19.	 Controlling Device Feedback0m

To get the settings of feedbacks on an extension device, use
1mGetFeedbackControl22m.   This request provides functionality
equivalent to the core 1mGetKeyboardControl 22mand 1mGetPointerCon-0m
1mtrol 22mfunctions.  It also provides a way to control displays
associated with an input device that are capable of display-
ing an integer or string.

     where

	  FEEDBACKSTATE:   {KbdFeedbackState, PtrFeedbackState,
			   IntegerFeedbackState, StringFeedback-
			   State, BellFeedbackState, LedFeedback-
			   State}


Feedbacks are reported by class.  Those feedbacks that are
reported for the core keyboard device are in class 1mKbdFeed-0m
1mback22m, and are returned in the 1mKbdFeedbackState 22mstructure.
The members of that structure are as follows:

     CLASS Kbd:	  [class: CARD8

		   feedback id: CARD8
		   key_click_percent: CARD8
		   bell_percent: CARD8

		   led_value: BITMASK
		   global_auto_repeat: {AutoRepeatModeOn,
		  AutoRepeatModeOff}
		   auto_repeats: LISTofCARD8]


Those feedbacks that are equivalent to those reported for
the core pointer are in feedback class 1mPtrFeedback 22mand are
reported in the 1mPtrFeedbackState 22mstructure.  The members of
that structure are:

Some input devices provide a means of displaying an integer.
Those devices will support feedback class 1mIntegerFeedback22m,
which is reported in the 1mIntegerFeedbackState 22mstructure.
The members of that structure are:



     CLASS Integer:   [class: CARD8

		       max-val: INT32]


Some input devices provide a means of displaying a string.
Those devices will support feedback class 1mStringFeedback22m,
which is reported in the 1mStringFeedbackState 22mstructure.  The
members of that structure are:


     CLASS String:   [class: CARD8
		      length: CARD16
		      feedback id: CARD8
		      max_symbols: CARD16
		      num_keysyms_supported: CARD16
		      keysyms_supported: LISTofKEYSYM]


Some input devices contain a bell.  Those devices will sup-
port feedback class 1mBellFeedback22m, which is reported in the
1mBellFeedbackState 22mstructure.  The members of that structure
are:



     CLASS Bell:   [class: CARD8
		    length: CARD16
		    feedback id: CARD8
		    percent: CARD8
		    pitch: CARD16
		    duration: CARD16]


The percent sets the base volume for the bell between 0
(off) and 100 (loud) inclusive, if possible.  Setting to -1



			     1m300m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


restores the default.  Other negative values generate a
1mValue 22merror.

The pitch sets the pitch (specified in Hz) of the bell, if
possible.  Setting to -1 restores the default.	Other nega-
tive values generate a 1mValue 22merror.

The duration sets the duration (specified in milliseconds)
of the bell, if possible.  Setting to -1 restores the
default.  Other negative values generate a 1mValue 22merror.

A bell generator connected with the console but not directly
on the device is treated as if it were part of the device.
Some input devices contain LEDs.  Those devices will support
feedback class 1mLed22m, which is reported in the 1mLedFeedback-0m
1mState 22mstructure.  The members of that structure are:



     CLASS Led:	  [class: CARD8
		   length: CARD16
		   feedback id: CARD8
		   led_mask: BITMASK
		   led_value: BITMASK]


Each bit in led_mask indicates that the corresponding led is
supported by the feedback.  At most 32 LEDs per feedback are
supported.  No standard interpretation of LEDs is defined.

This function will fail with a 1mBadMatch 22merror if the device
specified in the request does not support feedbacks.

Errors:	 Device, Match

To change the settings of a feedback on an extension device,
use 1mChangeFeedbackControl22m.

1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


Feedback controls are grouped by class.	 Those feedbacks
that are equivalent to those supported by the core keyboard
are controlled by feedback class 1mKbdFeedbackClass 22musing the
1mKbdFeedbackControl 22mstructure.  The members of that structure
are:

     KBDFEEDBACKCTL:   [class: CARD8

			led_value: INT32
			key: KEYCODE
			auto_repeat_mode: {AutoRepeatModeOn,
			 AutoRepeatModeOff, AutoRepeatModeDe-
		       fault}]


The key_click_percent sets the volume for key clicks between
0 (off) and 100 (loud) inclusive, if possible.	Setting to
-1 restores the default.  Other negative values generate a
1mValue 22merror.

If both auto_repeat_mode and key are specified, then the
auto_repeat_mode of that key is changed, if possible.  If
only auto_repeat_mode is specified, then the global auto-
repeat mode for the entire keyboard is changed, if possible,
without affecting the per-key settings.	 It is a 1mMatch 22merror
if a key is specified without an auto_repeat_mode.

The order in which controls are verified and altered is
server-dependent.  If an error is generated, a subset of the
controls may have been altered.

Those feedback controls equivalent to those of the core
pointer are controlled by feedback class 1mPtrFeedbackClass0m
using the 1mPtrFeedbackControl 22mstructure.  The members of that
structure are as follows:


     PTRFEEDBACKCTL:   [class: CARD8
			length: CARD16
			feedback id: CARD8
			accelNumerator: INT16
			accelDenominator: INT16
			threshold: INT16]


The acceleration, expressed as a fraction, is a multiplier
for movement. For example, specifying 3/1 means the device
moves three times as fast as normal.  The fraction may be



			     1m320m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


rounded arbitrarily by the X server.  Acceleration only
takes effect if the device moves more than threshold pixels
at once and only applies to the amount beyond the value in
the threshold argument.	 Setting a value to -1 restores the
default.  The values of the do-accel and do-threshold argu-
ments must be nonzero for the device values to be set.	Oth-
erwise, the parameters will be unchanged.  Negative values
generate a 1mValue 22merror, as does a zero value for the accel-
denominator argument.

Some devices are capable of displaying an integer.  This is
done using feedback class 1mIntegerFeedbackClass 22musing the
1mIntegerFeedbackControl 22mstructure.	The members of that
structure are as follows:


     INTEGERCTL:   [class: CARD8

This request is analogous to the core 1mBell 22mrequest.  It
rings the specified bell on the specified input device feed-
back, using the specified volume.  The specified volume is
relative to the base volume for the feedback.  If the value
for the percent argument is not in the range -100 to 100
inclusive, a 1mValue 22merror results.	The volume at which the
bell rings when the percent argument is nonnegative is:


	    base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent


The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument
is negative is:

being used as modifiers.  The number of keycodes in the list
is 8*keycodes-per-modifier.  The keycodes are divided into
eight sets, with each set containing keycodes-per-modifier
elements.  The sets are assigned in order to the modifiers

keycodes-per-modifier value is chosen arbitrarily by the
server; zeroes are used to fill in unused elements within
each set.  If only zero values are given in a set, the use
of the corresponding modifier has been disabled.  The order
of keycodes within each set is chosen arbitrarily by the
server.

To set which keycodes that are to be used as modifiers for

This request is analogous to the core 1mSetModifierMapping0m

the keys to be used as modifiers.  The number of keycodes in
the list must be 8*keycodes-per-modifier (else a 1mLength0m

Only non-zero keycode values are used within each set; zero
values are ignored.  All of the non-zero keycodes must be in
the range specified by min-keycode and max-keycode in the
1mListInputDevices 22mrequest (else a 1mValue 22merror).  The order of
keycodes within a set does not matter.	If no non-zero val-
ues are specified in a set, the use of the corresponding
modifier is disabled, and the modifier bit will always be
zero.  Otherwise, the modifier bit will be one whenever at
least one of the keys in the corresponding set is in the
down position.

A server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
changed (for example, if certain keys do not generate up
transitions in hardware or if multiple keys per modifier are
not supported).	 The status reply is 1mFailed 22mif some such
restriction is violated, and none of the modifiers are
changed.

If the new non-zero keycodes specified for a modifier differ
from those currently defined, and any (current or new) keys
for that modifier are logically in the down state, then the
status reply is 1mBusy22m, and none of the modifiers are changed.

     This request generates a DeviceMappingNotify event on a
     1mSuccess 22mstatus.  The 1mDeviceMappingNotify 22mevent will be
     sent only to those clients that have expressed an
     interest in receiving that event via the 1mXSelectExten-0m
     1msionEvent 22mrequest.

A X server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
changed, for example, if certain keys do not generate up
transitions in hardware or if multiple modifier keys are not
supported.  If some such restriction is violated, the status
reply is 1mMappingFailed 22m, and none of the modifiers are
changed.  If the new keycodes specified for a modifier

1m2.22.	 Controlling Button Mapping0m

These requests are analogous to the core 1mGetPointerMapping0m
and 1mChangePointerMapping 22mrequests.	 They allow a client to
determine the current mapping of buttons on an extension
device, and to change that mapping.

To get the current button mapping for an extension device,
use 1mGetDeviceButtonMapping22m.

The 1mGetDeviceButtonMapping 22mfunction returns the current map-
ping of the buttons on the specified device.  Elements of
the list are indexed starting from one.	 The length of the

1mGetDeviceButtonMapping 22mwould return.  Otherwise, 1mSetDevice-0m
1mButtonMapping 22mgenerates a 1mValue 22merror.  A zero element dis-
ables a buttons, and elements are not restricted in value by
the number of physical buttons.	 However, no two elements
can have the same nonzero value.  Otherwise, this function
generates a 1mValue 22merror.  If any of the buttons to be
altered are in the down state, the status reply is 1mMapping-0m
1mBusy 22mand the mapping is not changed.

The 1mQueryDeviceState 22mrequest returns the current logical
state of the buttons, keys, and valuators on the specified
input device.  The 4mbuttons24m and 4mkeys24m arrays, byte N (from 0)
contains the bits for key or button 8N to 8N+7 with the
least significant bit in the byte representing key or button
8N.



			     1m390m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


If the device has valuators, a bit in the mode field indi-
cates whether the device is reporting Absolute or Relative
data.  If it is reporting Absolute data, the valuators array
will contain the current value of the valuators.  If it is
reporting Relative data, the valuators array will contain
undefined data.

If the device reports proximity information, a bit in the
mode field indicates whether the device is InProximity or
OutOfProximity.

1m3.  Events0m

The input extension creates input events analogous to the
core input events.  These extension input events are gener-
ated by manipulating one of the extension input devices.

1m3.1.	Button, Key, and Motion Events0m

DeviceKeyPress
DeviceKeyRelease
DeviceButtonPress,
DeviceButtonRelease
DeviceMotionNotify

     device: CARD8
     root, event: WINDOW
     child: Window or None
     same-screen: BOOL
     root-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16
     detail: <see below>
     state: SETofKEYBUTMASK
     time: TIMESTAMP


These events are generated when a key, button, or valuator
logically changes state.  The generation of these logical
changes may lag the physical changes, if device event pro-
cessing is frozen.  Note that 1mDeviceKeyPress 22mand
1mDeviceKeyRelease 22mare generated for all keys, even those
mapped to modifier bits.  The ``source'' of the event is the
window the pointer is in.  The window with respect to which
the event is normally reported is found by looking up the
hierarchy (starting with the source window) for the first
window on which any client has selected interest in the
event.	The actual window used for reporting can be modified
by active grabs and by the focus window.The window the event
is reported with respect to is called the ``event'' window.

The root is the root window of the ``source'' window, and
root-x and root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to
root's origin at the time of the event.	 Event is the
``event'' window.  If the event window is on the same screen
as root, then event-x and event-y are the pointer



			     1m400m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


coordinates relative to the event window's origin.  Other-
wise, event-x and event-y are zero.  If the source window is
an inferior of the event window, then child is set to the
child of the event window that is an ancestor of (or is) the
source window.	Otherwise, it is set to None. The state com-
ponent gives the logical state of the buttons on the core X
pointer and modifier keys on the core X keyboard just before
the event.  The detail component type varies with the event
type:

+--------------------+-------------------+
|Event		     | Component	 |
+--------------------+-------------------+
|DeviceKeyPress,     | KEYCODE		 |
|DeviceKeyRelease    |			 |
+--------------------+-------------------+
|DeviceButtonPress,  | BUTTON		 |
|DeviceButtonRelease |			 |
+--------------------+-------------------+
|DeviceMotionNotify  | { Normal , Hint } |
+--------------------+-------------------+

The granularity of motion events is not guaranteed, but a
client selecting for motion events is guaranteed to get at
least one event when a valuator changes. If 1mDeviceMotionHint0m
is selected, the server is free to send only one 1mDeviceMo-0m
1mtionNotify 22mevent (with detail 1mHint22m) to the client for the
event window, until either a key or button changes state,
the pointer leaves the event window, or the client issues a
1mQueryDeviceState 22mor 1mGetDeviceMotionEvents 22mrequest.

1m3.2.	DeviceValuator Event0m

DeviceValuator

     device: CARD8
     device_state: SETofKEYBUTMASK
     num_valuators: CARD8
     first_valuator: CARD8
     valuators: LISTofINT32


DeviceValuator events are generated to contain valuator
information for which there is insufficient space in
DeviceKey, DeviceButton, DeviceMotion, and Proximity wire
events.	 For events of these types, a second event of type
DeviceValuator follows immediately.  The library combines
these events into a single event that a client can receive
via XNextEvent.	 DeviceValuator events are not selected for
by clients, they only exist to contain information that will
not fit into some event selected by clients.

The device_state component gives the state of the buttons
and modifiers on the device generating the event.



			     1m410m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


Extension motion devices may report motion data for a vari-
able number of axes.  The valuators array contains the val-
ues of all axes reported by the device.	 If more than 6 axes
are reported, more than one DeviceValuator event will be
sent by the server, and more than one DeviceKey, DeviceBut-
ton, DeviceMotion, or Proximity event will be reported by
the library.  Clients should examine the corresponding
fields of the event reported by the library to determine the
total number of axes reported, and the first axis reported
in the current event.  Axes are numbered beginning with
zero.

For Button, Key and Motion events on a device reporting
absolute motion data the current value of the device's valu-
ators is reported.  For devices that report relative data,
Button and Key events may be followed by a DeviceValuator
event that contains 0s in the num_valuators field.   In this
case, only the device_state component will have meaning.

1m3.3.	Device Focus Events0m

DeviceFocusIn
DeviceFocusOut

     device: CARD8
     time: TIMESTAMP
     event: WINDOW
     mode: { Normal, WhileGrabbed, Grab, Ungrab}
     detail: { Ancestor, Virtual, Inferior, Nonlinear, Non-
     linearVirtual, Pointer, PointerRoot, None}

These events are generated when the input focus changes and
are reported to clients selecting 1mDeviceFocusChange 22mfor the
specified device and window.  Events generated by 1mSetDevice-0m
1mFocus 22mwhen the device is not grabbed have mode 1mNormal22m.
Events generated by 1mSetDeviceFocus 22mwhen the device is
grabbed have mode 1mWhileGrabbed22m.  Events generated when a
device grab actives have mode 1mGrab22m, and events generated
when a device grab deactivates have mode 1mUngrab22m.

All 1mDeviceFocusOut 22mevents caused by a window unmap are gen-
erated after any 1mUnmapNotify 22mevent, but the ordering of
1mDeviceFocusOut 22mwith respect to generated 1mEnterNotify22m,
1mLeaveNotify22m, 1mVisibilityNotify 22mand 1mExpose 22mevents is not con-
strained.

1mDeviceFocusIn 22mand 1mDeviceFocusOut 22mevents are generated for
focus changes of extension devices in the same manner as
focus events for the core devices are generated.

1m3.4.	Device State Notify Event0m

			     1m420m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


     time: TIMESTAMP

	       #x01 reporting keys
     buttons: LISTofCARD8
     keys: LISTofCARD8
     valuators: LISTofCARD32


This event reports the state of the device just as in the
1mQueryDeviceState 22mrequest.	This event is reported to clients
selecting 1mDeviceStateNotify 22mfor the device and window and is
generated immediately after every 1mEnterNotify 22mand 1mDeviceFo-0m
1mcusIn22m.  If the device has no more than 32 buttons, no more
than 32 keys, and no more than 3 valuators, This event can
report the state of the device.	 If the device has more than
32 buttons, the event will be immediately followed by a
DeviceButtonStateNotify event.	If the device has more than
32 keys, the event will be followed by a DeviceKeyStateNo-
tify event.  If the device has more than 3 valuators, the
event will be followed by one or more DeviceValuator events.

1m3.5.	Device KeyState and ButtonState Notify Events0m

DeviceKeyStateNotify

     device: CARD8
     keys: LISTofCARD8

DeviceButtonStateNotify

     device: CARD8
     buttons: LISTofCARD8

These events contain information about the state of keys and
buttons on a device that will not fit into the DeviceS-
tateNotify wire event.	These events are not selected by
clients, rather they may immediately follow a DeviceStateNo-
tify wire event and be combined with it into a single
DeviceStateNotify client event that a client may receive via
XNextEvent.

DeviceMappingNotify

     time: TIMESTAMP
     device: CARD8
     request: CARD8
     first_keycode: CARD8
     count: CARD8

This event reports a change in the mapping of keys, modi-
fiers, or buttons on an extension device.  This event is
reported to clients selecting 1mDeviceMappingNotify 22mfor the
device and window and is generated after every client 1mSetDe-0m
1mviceButtonMapping22m, 1mChangeDeviceKeyMapping22m, or	 1mChangeDevice-0m
1mModifierMapping 22mrequest.

1m3.7.	ChangeDeviceNotify Event0m

ChangeDeviceNotify

     device: CARD8
     time: TIMESTAMP
     request: CARD8

This event reports a change in the physical device being
used as the core X keyboard or X pointer device.  1mChangeDe-0m
1mviceNotify 22mevents are reported to clients selecting
1mChangeDeviceNotify 22mfor the device and window and is gener-
ated after every client 1mChangeKeyboardDevice 22mor  1mChangePoin-0m

The ``source'' of the event is the window the pointer is in.
The window with respect to which the event is normally
reported is found by looking up the hierarchy (starting with
the source window) for the first window on which any client
has selected interest in the event.  The actual window used
for reporting can be modified by active grabs and by the
focus window.The window the event is reported with respect
to is called the ``event'' window.

The root is the root window of the ``source'' window, and
root-x and root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to
root's origin at the time of the event.	 Event is the
``event'' window.  If the event window is on the same screen
as root, then event-x and event-y are the pointer coordi-
nates relative to the event window's origin.  Otherwise,
event-x and event-y are zero.  If the source window is an
inferior of the event window, then child is set to the child
of the event window that is an ancestor of (or is) the
source window.	Otherwise, it is set to None. The state com-
ponent gives the logical state of the buttons on the core X
pointer and modifier keys on the core X keyboard just before
the event.  The device-state component gives the state of
the buttons and modifiers on the device generating the
event.

	     1mInput Extension Protocol Encoding0m



1mSyntactic Conventions0m

All numbers are in decimal, unless prefixed with #x, in
which case they are in hexadecimal (base 16).

The general syntax used to describe requests, replies,
errors, events, and compound types is:


     1mNameofThing0m
       encode-form
       ...
       encode-form

Each encode-form describes a single component.

For components described in the protocol as:


     name: TYPE

the encode-form is:


     N	       TYPE name

N is the number of bytes occupied in the data stream, and
TYPE is the interpretation of those bytes.  For example,


     depth: CARD8

becomes:


     1	       CARD8	      depth

For components with a static numeric value the encode-form
is:


     N	       value	      name

The value is always interpreted as an N-byte unsigned inte-
ger.  For example, the first two bytes of a Window error are
always zero (indicating an error in general) and three



			     1m460m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


(indicating the Window error in particular):


     1	       0    Error
     1	       3    code

For components described in the protocol as:


     name: 1m{Name1, ..., NameI}0m


the encode-form is:


     N		    name
	       value1 Name1
	       ...
	       valueI NameI

The value is always interpreted as an N-byte unsigned inte-
ger.  Note that the size of N is sometimes larger than that
strictly required to encode the values.	 For example:


     class: 1m{InputOutput, InputOnly, CopyFromParent}0m


becomes:


     2			      class
	       0    CopyFromParent
	       1    InputOutput
	       2    InputOnly

For components described in the protocol as:


     NAME: TYPE or 1mAlternative1 ... or AlternativeI0m


the encode-form is:


     N	       TYPE	      NAME
	       value1	 Alternative1
	       ...
	       valueI	 AlternativeI

The alternative values are guaranteed not to conflict with
the encoding of TYPE.  For example:





			     1m470m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


     destination: WINDOW or 1mPointerWindow 22mor 1mInputFocus0m


becomes:


     4	       WINDOW	      destination
	       0    PointerWindow
	       1    InputFocus

For components described in the protocol as:


     value-mask: BITMASK

the encode-form is:


     N	       BITMASK	      value-mask
	       mask1	 mask-name1
	       ...
	       maskI	 mask-nameI

The individual bits in the mask are specified and named, and
N is 2 or 4.  The most-significant bit in a BITMASK is
reserved for use in defining chained (multiword) bitmasks,
as extensions augment existing core requests.  The precise
interpretation of this bit is not yet defined here, although
a probable mechanism is that a 1-bit indicates that another
N bytes of bitmask follows, with bits within the overall
mask still interpreted from least-significant to most-sig-
nificant with an N-byte unit, with N-byte units interpreted
in stream order, and with the overall mask being byte-
swapped in individual N-byte units.

For LISTofVALUE encodings, the request is followed by a sec-
tion of the form:


     VALUEs
      encode-form
      ...
      encode-form

listing an encode-form for each VALUE.	The NAME in each
encode-form keys to the corresponding BITMASK bit.  The
encoding of a VALUE always occupies four bytes, but the num-
ber of bytes specified in the encoding-form indicates how
many of the least-significant bytes are actually used; the
remaining bytes are unused and their values do not matter.

In various cases, the number of bytes occupied by a compo-
nent will be specified by a lowercase single-letter variable
name instead of a specific numeric value, and often some



			     1m480m





1mX Input Extension Protocol Specification    X11, Release 6.40m


other component will have its value specified as a simple
numeric expression involving these variables.  Components
specified with such expressions are always interpreted as
unsigned integers.  The scope of such variables is always
just the enclosing request, reply, error, event, or compound
type structure.	 For example:


     2	       3+n	      request length
     4n	       LISTofPOINT    points

For unused bytes (the values of the bytes are undefined and
do not matter), the encode-form is:


     N			 unused

If the number of unused bytes is variable, the encode-form
typically is:


     p			 unused, p=pad(E)

where E is some expression, and pad(E) is the number of
bytes needed to round E up to a multiple of four.


     pad(E) = (4 - (E mod 4)) mod 4
