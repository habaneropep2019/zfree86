Thanks go to Al Mento of Digital's UEG Documentation Group
for formatting this document.

This document does not attempt to provide the rationale or
pragmatics required to fully understand the protocol or to
place it in perspective within a complete system.














The protocol contains many management mechanisms that are
not intended for normal applications.  Not all mechanisms
are needed to build a particular user interface.  It is
important to keep in mind that the protocol is intended to
provide mechanism, not policy.

1m1.  Protocol Formats0m

1mRequest Format0m

Every request contains an 8-bit major opcode and a 16-bit
length field expressed in units of four bytes.	Every
request consists of four bytes of a header (containing the
major opcode, the length field, and a data byte) followed by
zero or more additional bytes of data.	The length field
defines the total length of the request, including the
header.	 The length field in a request must equal the mini-
mum length required to contain the request.  If the speci-
fied length is smaller or larger than the required length,
an error is generated.	Unused bytes in a request are not
required to be zero.  Major opcodes 128 through 255 are
reserved for extensions.  Extensions are intended to contain
multiple requests, so extension requests typically have an
additional minor opcode encoded in the second data byte in
the request header.  However, the placement and interpreta-
tion of this minor opcode and of all other fields in exten-
sion requests are not defined by the core protocol.  Every
request on a given connection is implicitly assigned a
sequence number, starting with one, that is used in replies,
errors, and events.

1mReply Format0m

Every reply contains a 32-bit length field expressed in
units of four bytes.  Every reply consists of 32 bytes fol-
lowed by zero or more additional bytes of data, as specified
in the length field.  Unused bytes within a reply are not
guaranteed to be zero.	Every reply also contains the least
significant 16 bits of the sequence number of the corre-
sponding request.

1mError Format0m

Error reports are 32 bytes long.  Every error includes an
8-bit error code.  Error codes 128 through 255 are reserved
for extensions.	 Every error also includes the major and
minor opcodes of the failed request and the least signifi-
cant 16 bits of the sequence number of the request.  For the
following errors (see section 4), the failing resource ID is
also returned: 4mColormap24m, 4mCursor24m, 4mDrawable24m, 4mFont24m, 4mGContext24m,
4mIDChoice24m, 4mPixmap24m, and 4mWindow24m.  For 4mAtom24m errors, the failing
atom is returned.  For 4mValue24m errors, the failing value is
returned.  Other core errors return no additional data.
Unused bytes within an error are not guaranteed to be zero.

1mEvent Format0m

Events are 32 bytes long.  Unused bytes within an event are
not guaranteed to be zero.  Every event contains an 8-bit
type code.  The most significant bit in this code is set if



			      1m10m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


the event was generated from a 4mSendEvent24m request.	Event
codes 64 through 127 are reserved for extensions, although
the core protocol does not define a mechanism for selecting
interest in such events.  Every core event (with the excep-
tion of 4mKeymapNotify24m) also contains the least significant 16
bits of the sequence number of the last request issued by
the client that was (or is currently being) processed by the
server.

1m2.  Syntactic Conventions0m

The rest of this document uses the following syntactic con-
ventions.

    The syntax {...} encloses a set of alternatives.

    The syntax [...] encloses a set of structure compo-
     nents.

    In general, TYPEs are in uppercase and 4mAlternativeVal-0m
     4mues24m are capitalized.

    Requests in section 9 are described in the following
     format:


     4mRequestName0m
	    4marg124m: type1
	    ...
	    4margN24m: typeN
	->
	    result1: type1
	    ...
	    resultM: typeM

	    Errors: kind1, ..., kindK

	    Description.


     If no -> is present in the description, then the
     request has no reply (it is asynchronous), although
     errors may still be reported.  If ->+ is used, then one
     or more replies can be generated for a single request.

    Events in section 11 are described in the following
     format:


     4mEventName0m
	    4mvalue124m: type1
	    ...
	    4mvalueN24m: typeN

	    Description.


1m3.  Common Types0m


-------------------------------------------------------------------
1mName		 Value0m
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LISTofFOO      A type name of the form LISTofFOO means a counted
	       list of elements of type FOO.  The size of the
	       length field may vary (it is not necessarily the
	       same size as a FOO), and in some cases, it may be
	       implicit.  It is fully specified in Appendix B.
	       Except where explicitly noted, zero-length lists
	       are legal.
BITMASK	       The types BITMASK and LISTofVALUE are somewhat spe-
LISTofVALUE    cial.  Various requests contain arguments of the
	       form:
	       4mvalue-mask24m: BITMASK
	       4mvalue-list24m: LISTofVALUE
	       These are used to allow the client to specify a
	       subset of a heterogeneous collection of optional
	       arguments.  The value-mask specifies which argu-
	       ments are to be provided; each such argument is
	       assigned a unique bit position.	The representation
	       of the BITMASK will typically contain more bits
	       than there are defined arguments.  The unused bits
	       in the value-mask must be zero (or the server gen-
	       erates a 4mValue24m error).  The value-list contains one
	       value for each bit set to 1 in the mask, from least
	       significant to most significant bit in the mask.
	       Each value is represented with four bytes, but the
	       actual value occupies only the least significant
	       bytes as required.  The values of the unused bytes
	       do not matter.
OR	       A type of the form ``T1 or ... or Tn'' means the
	       union of the indicated types.  A single-element
	       type is given as the element without enclosing
	       braces.
WINDOW	       32-bit value (top three bits guaranteed to be zero)
PIXMAP	       32-bit value (top three bits guaranteed to be zero)

COLORMAP       32-bit value (top three bits guaranteed to be zero)
DRAWABLE       WINDOW or PIXMAP
FONTABLE       FONT or GCONTEXT
ATOM	       32-bit value (top three bits guaranteed to be zero)
VISUALID       32-bit value (top three bits guaranteed to be zero)
VALUE	       32-bit quantity (used only in LISTofVALUE)

The [x,y] coordinates of a RECTANGLE specify the upper-left
corner.

The primary interpretation of large characters in a STRING16
is that they are composed of two bytes used to index a two-
dimensional matrix, hence, the use of CHAR2B rather than
CARD16.	 This corresponds to the JIS/ISO method of indexing
2-byte characters.  It is expected that most large fonts
will be defined with 2-byte matrix indexing.  For large
fonts constructed with linear indexing, a CHAR2B can be
interpreted as a 16-bit number by treating byte1 as the most
significant byte.  This means that clients should always
transmit such 16-bit character values most significant byte
first, as the server will never byte-swap CHAR2B quantities.

The length, format, and interpretation of a HOST address are
specific to the family (see 4mChangeHosts24m request).

1m4.  Errors0m

In general, when a request terminates with an error, the
request has no side effects (that is, there is no partial
execution).  The only requests for which this is not true
are 4mChangeWindowAttributes24m, 4mChangeGC24m, 4mPolyText824m, 4mPolyText1624m,
4mFreeColors24m, 4mStoreColors24m, and 4mChangeKeyboardControl24m.

The following error codes result from various requests as
follows:

		  The semantics when a server runs out of

4mImplementation24m    The server does not implement some aspect

1m5.  Keyboards0m

A KEYCODE represents a physical (or logical) key.  Keycodes
lie in the inclusive range [8,255].  A keycode value carries
no intrinsic information, although server implementors may
attempt to encode geometry information (for example, matrix)
to be interpreted in a server-dependent fashion.  The map-
ping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed using the
protocol.

A KEYSYM is an encoding of a symbol on the cap of a key.
The set of defined KEYSYMs include the character sets
Latin-1, Latin-2, Latin-3, Latin-4, Kana, Arabic, Cyrillic,
Greek, Tech, Special, Publish, APL, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean
as well as a set of symbols common on keyboards (Return,
Help, Tab, and so on).	KEYSYMs with the most significant
bit (of the 29 bits) set are reserved as vendor-specific.

A list of KEYSYMs is associated with each KEYCODE.  The list
is intended to convey the set of symbols on the correspond-
ing key.  If the list (ignoring trailing 4mNoSymbol24m entries)
is a single KEYSYM ``4mK24m'', then the list is treated as if it
were the list ``4mK24m NoSymbol 4mK24m NoSymbol''.  If the list
(ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries) is a pair of KEYSYMs
``4mK124m 4mK224m'', then the list is treated as if it were the list
``4mK124m 4mK224m 4mK124m 4mK224m''.  If the list (ignoring trailing 4mNoSymbol0m
entries) is a triple of KEYSYMs ``4mK124m 4mK224m 4mK324m'', then the list
is treated as if it were the list ``4mK124m 4mK224m 4mK324m NoSymbol''.
When an explicit ``void'' element is desired in the list,
the value 4mVoidSymbol24m can be used.

The first four elements of the list are split into two
groups of KEYSYMs.  Group 1 contains the first and second
KEYSYMs, Group 2 contains the third and fourth KEYSYMs.
Within each group, if the second element of the group is
4mNoSymbol24m, then the group should be treated as if the second
element were the same as the first element, except when the
first element is an alphabetic KEYSYM ``4mK24m'' for which both
lowercase and uppercase forms are defined.  In that case,
the group should be treated as if the first element were the
lowercase form of ``4mK24m'' and the second element were the
uppercase form of ``4mK24m''.

The standard rules for obtaining a KEYSYM from a 4mKeyPress0m
event make use of only the Group 1 and Group 2 KEYSYMs; no
interpretation of other KEYSYMs in the list is defined.	 The
modifier state determines which group to use.  Switching
between groups is controlled by the KEYSYM named MODE
SWITCH, by attaching that KEYSYM to some KEYCODE and attach-
ing that KEYCODE to any one of the modifiers 4mMod124m through
4mMod524m.  This modifier is called the ``group modifier''.  For
any KEYCODE, Group 1 is used when the group modifier is off,
and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.




			      1m80m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The 4mLock24m modifier is interpreted as CapsLock when the KEYSYM
named CAPS LOCK is attached to some KEYCODE and that KEYCODE
is attached to the 4mLock24m modifier.	The 4mLock24m modifier is
interpreted as ShiftLock when the KEYSYM named SHIFT LOCK is
attached to some KEYCODE and that KEYCODE is attached to the
4mLock24m modifier.  If the 4mLock24m modifier could be interpreted as
both CapsLock and ShiftLock, the CapsLock interpretation is
used.

The operation of ``keypad'' keys is controlled by the KEYSYM
named NUM LOCK, by attaching that KEYSYM to some KEYCODE and
attaching that KEYCODE to any one of the modifiers 4mMod10m
through 4mMod524m.  This modifier is called the ``numlock modi-
fier''.	 The standard KEYSYMs with the prefix KEYPAD in
their name are called ``keypad'' KEYSYMs; these are KEYSYMS
with numeric value in the hexadecimal range #xFF80 to #xFFBD
inclusive.  In addition, vendor-specific KEYSYMS in the
hexadecimal range #x11000000 to #x1100FFFF are also keypad
KEYSYMs.

Within a group, the choice of KEYSYM is determined by apply-
ing the first rule that is satisfied from the following
list:

    The numlock modifier is on and the second KEYSYM is a
     keypad KEYSYM.  In this case, if the 4mShift24m modifier is
     on, or if the 4mLock24m modifier is on and is interpreted as
     ShiftLock, then the first KEYSYM is used; otherwise,
     the second KEYSYM is used.

    The 4mShift24m and 4mLock24m modifiers are both off.  In this
     case, the first KEYSYM is used.

    The 4mShift24m modifier is off, and the 4mLock24m modifier is on
     and is interpreted as CapsLock.  In this case, the
     first KEYSYM is used, but if that KEYSYM is lowercase
     alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase KEYSYM is
     used instead.

    The 4mShift24m modifier is on, and the 4mLock24m modifier is on
     and is interpreted as CapsLock.  In this case, the sec-
     ond KEYSYM is used, but if that KEYSYM is lowercase
     alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase KEYSYM is
     used instead.

    The 4mShift24m modifier is on, or the 4mLock24m modifier is on
     and is interpreted as ShiftLock, or both.	In this
     case, the second KEYSYM is used.

The mapping between KEYCODEs and KEYSYMs is not used
directly by the server; it is merely stored for reading and
writing by clients.

Buttons are always numbered starting with one.

1m7.  Predefined Atoms0m

Predefined atoms are not strictly necessary and may not be
useful in all environments, but they will eliminate many
4mInternAtom24m requests in most applications.	Note that they
are predefined only in the sense of having numeric values,
not in the sense of having required semantics.	The core
protocol imposes no semantics on these names, but semantics
are specified in other X.Org standards, such as the 4mInter-0m
4mClient24m 4mCommunication24m 4mConventions24m 4mManual24m and the 4mX24m 4mLogical0m
4mFont24m 4mDescription24m 4mConventions24m.

The following names have predefined atom values.  Note that
uppercase and lowercase matter.

To avoid conflicts with possible future names for which
semantics might be imposed (either at the protocol level or
in terms of higher level user interface models), names
beginning with an underscore should be used for atoms that
are private to a particular vendor or organization.  To
guarantee no conflicts between vendors and organizations,
additional prefixes need to be used.  However, the protocol
does not define the mechanism for choosing such prefixes.
For names private to a single application or end user but
stored in globally accessible locations, it is suggested



			     1m100m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


that two leading underscores be used to avoid conflicts with
other names.

1m8.  Connection Setup0m

For remote clients, the X protocol can be built on top of
any reliable byte stream.

1mConnection Initiation0m

The client must send an initial byte of data to identify the
byte order to be employed.  The value of the byte must be
octal 102 or 154.  The value 102 (ASCII uppercase B) means
values are transmitted most significant byte first, and
value 154 (ASCII lowercase l) means values are transmitted
least significant byte first.  Except where explicitly noted
in the protocol, all 16-bit and 32-bit quantities sent by
the client must be transmitted with this byte order, and all
16-bit and 32-bit quantities returned by the server will be
transmitted with this byte order.

Following the byte-order byte, the client sends the follow-
ing information at connection setup:

     protocol-major-version: CARD16
     protocol-minor-version: CARD16
     authorization-protocol-name: STRING8
     authorization-protocol-data: STRING8

The version numbers indicate what version of the protocol
the client expects the server to implement.

The authorization name indicates what authorization (and
authentication) protocol the client expects the server to
use, and the data is specific to that protocol.	 Specifica-
tion of valid authorization mechanisms is not part of the
core X protocol.  A server that does not implement the pro-
tocol the client expects or that only implements the host-
based mechanism may simply ignore this information.  If both
name and data strings are empty, this is to be interpreted
as ``no explicit authorization.''

1mServer Response0m

The client receives the following information at connection
setup:

     success: {4mFailed24m, 4mSuccess24m, 4mAuthenticate24m}

The client receives the following additional data if the
returned success value is 4mFailed24m, and the connection is not
successfully established:

     protocol-major-version: CARD16

     reason: STRING8

The client receives the following additional data if the
returned success value is 4mAuthenticate24m, and further authen-
tication negotiation is required:

     reason: STRING8

The contents of the reason string are specific to the autho-
rization protocol in use.  The semantics of this authentica-
tion negotiation are not constrained, except that the nego-
tiation must eventually terminate with a reply from the
server containing a success value of 4mFailed24m or 4mSuccess24m.

The client receives the following additional data if the

1mServer Information0m

The information that is global to the server is:

The protocol version numbers are an escape hatch in case
future revisions of the protocol are necessary.	 In general,
the major version would increment for incompatible changes,
and the minor version would increment for small upward com-
patible changes.  Barring changes, the major version will be
11, and the minor version will be 0.  The protocol version
numbers returned indicate the protocol the server actually
supports.  This might not equal the version sent by the
client.	 The server can (but need not) refuse connections
from clients that offer a different version than the server
supports.  A server can (but need not) support more than one
version simultaneously.

The vendor string gives some identification of the owner of
the server implementation.  The vendor controls the seman-
tics of the release number.

The resource-id-mask contains a single contiguous set of
bits (at least 18).  The client allocates resource IDs for
types WINDOW, PIXMAP, CURSOR, FONT, GCONTEXT, and COLORMAP
by choosing a value with only some subset of these bits set



			     1m130m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


and ORing it with resource-id-base.  Only values constructed
in this way can be used to name newly created resources over
this connection.  Resource IDs never have the top three bits
set.  The client is not restricted to linear or contiguous
allocation of resource IDs.  Once an ID has been freed, it
can be reused.	An ID must be unique with respect to the IDs
of all other resources, not just other resources of the same
type.  However, note that the value spaces of resource iden-
tifiers, atoms, visualids, and keysyms are distinguished by
context, and as such, are not required to be disjoint; for
example, a given numeric value might be both a valid window
ID, a valid atom, and a valid keysym.

Although the server is in general responsible for byte-swap-
ping data to match the client, images are always transmitted
and received in formats (including byte order) specified by
the server.  The byte order for images is given by image-
byte-order and applies to each scanline unit in XY format
(bitmap format) and to each pixel value in Z format.

A bitmap is represented in scanline order.  Each scanline is
padded to a multiple of bits as given by bitmap-scanline-
pad.  The pad bits are of arbitrary value.  The scanline is
quantized in multiples of bits as given by bitmap-scanline-
unit.  The bitmap-scanline-unit is always less than or equal
to the bitmap-scanline-pad.  Within each unit, the leftmost
bit in the bitmap is either the least significant or most
significant bit in the unit, as given by bitmap-bit-order.
If a pixmap is represented in XY format, each plane is rep-
resented as a bitmap, and the planes appear from most sig-
nificant to least significant in bit order with no padding
between planes.

Pixmap-formats contains one entry for each depth value.	 The
entry describes the Z format used to represent images of
that depth.  An entry for a depth is included if any screen
supports that depth, and all screens supporting that depth
must support only that Z format for that depth.	 In Z for-
mat, the pixels are in scanline order, left to right within
a scanline.  The number of bits used to hold each pixel is
given by bits-per-pixel.  Bits-per-pixel may be larger than
strictly required by the depth, in which case the least sig-
nificant bits are used to hold the pixmap data, and the val-
ues of the unused high-order bits are undefined.  When the
bits-per-pixel is 4, the order of nibbles in the byte is the
same as the image byte-order.  When the bits-per-pixel is 1,
the format is identical for bitmap format.  Each scanline is
padded to a multiple of bits as given by scanline-pad.	When
bits-per-pixel is 1, this will be identical to bitmap-scan-
line-pad.

How a pointing device roams the screens is up to the server
implementation and is transparent to the protocol.  No geom-
etry is defined among screens.



			     1m140m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The server may retain the recent history of pointer motion
and do so to a finer granularity than is reported by 4mMotion-0m
4mNotify24m events.  The 4mGetMotionEvents24m request makes such his-
tory available.	 The motion-buffer-size gives the approxi-
mate maximum number of elements in the history buffer.

Maximum-request-length specifies the maximum length of a
request accepted by the server, in 4-byte units.  That is,
length is the maximum value that can appear in the length
field of a request.  Requests larger than this maximum gen-
erate a 4mLength24m error, and the server will read and simply
discard the entire request.  Maximum-request-length will
always be at least 4096 (that is, requests of length up to
and including 16384 bytes will be accepted by all servers).

Min-keycode and max-keycode specify the smallest and largest
keycode values transmitted by the server.  Min-keycode is
never less than 8, and max-keycode is never greater than
255.  Not all keycodes in this range are required to have
corresponding keys.

1mScreen Information0m

The information that applies per screen is:

The allowed-depths specifies what pixmap and window depths
are supported.	Pixmaps are supported for each depth listed,
and windows of that depth are supported if at least one
visual type is listed for the depth.  A pixmap depth of one
is always supported and listed, but windows of depth one
might not be supported.	 A depth of zero is never listed,
but zero-depth 4mInputOnly24m windows are always supported.

Root-depth and root-visual specify the depth and visual type
of the root window.  Width-in-pixels and height-in-pixels
specify the size of the root window (which cannot be
changed).  The class of the root window is always 4mInputOut-0m
4mput24m.  Width-in-millimeters and height-in-millimeters can be
used to determine the physical size and the aspect ratio.

The default-colormap is the one initially associated with
the root window.  Clients with minimal color requirements
creating windows of the same depth as the root may want to
allocate from this map by default.

Black-pixel and white-pixel can be used in implementing a
monochrome application.	 These pixel values are for perma-
nently allocated entries in the default-colormap.  The
actual RGB values may be settable on some screens and, in
any case, may not actually be black and white.	The names
are intended to convey the expected relative intensity of
the colors.





			     1m150m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The border of the root window is initially a pixmap filled
with the black-pixel.  The initial background of the root
window is a pixmap filled with some unspecified two-color
pattern using black-pixel and white-pixel.

Min-installed-maps specifies the number of maps that can be
guaranteed to be installed simultaneously (with 4mInstallCol-0m
4mormap24m), regardless of the number of entries allocated in
each map.  Max-installed-maps specifies the maximum number
of maps that might possibly be installed simultaneously,
depending on their allocations.	 Multiple static-visual col-
ormaps with identical contents but differing in resource ID
should be considered as a single map for the purposes of
this number.  For the typical case of a single hardware col-
ormap, both values will be 1.

Backing-stores indicates when the server supports backing
stores for this screen, although it may be storage limited
in the number of windows it can support at once.  If save-
unders is 4mTrue24m, the server can support the save-under mode
in 4mCreateWindow24m and 4mChangeWindowAttributes24m, although again
it may be storage limited.

The current-input-events is what 4mGetWindowAttributes24m would
return for the all-event-masks for the root window.

1mVisual Information0m

The information that applies per visual-type is:

A given visual type might be listed for more than one depth
or for more than one screen.

For 4mPseudoColor24m, a pixel value indexes a colormap to produce
independent RGB values; the RGB values can be changed dynam-
ically.	 4mGrayScale24m is treated in the same way as 4mPseudoColor0m
except which primary drives the screen is undefined; thus,
the client should always store the same value for red,
green, and blue in colormaps.  For 4mDirectColor24m, a pixel
value is decomposed into separate RGB subfields, and each
subfield separately indexes the colormap for the correspond-
ing value.  The RGB values can be changed dynamically.
4mTrueColor24m is treated in the same way as 4mDirectColor24m except
the colormap has predefined read-only RGB values.  These
values are server-dependent but provide linear or near-lin-
ear increasing ramps in each primary.  4mStaticColor24m is
treated in the same way as 4mPseudoColor24m except the colormap
has predefined read-only RGB values, which are server-depen-
dent.  4mStaticGray24m is treated in the same way as 4mStaticColor0m
except the red, green, and blue values are equal for any
single pixel value, resulting in shades of gray.  4mStaticGray0m
with a two-entry colormap can be thought of as monochrome.





			     1m160m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The red-mask, green-mask, and blue-mask are only defined for
4mDirectColor24m and 4mTrueColor24m.  Each has one contiguous set of
bits set to 1 with no intersections.  Usually each mask has
the same number of bits set to 1.

The bits-per-rgb-value specifies the log base 2 of the num-
ber of distinct color intensity values (individually) of
red, green, and blue.  This number need not bear any rela-
tion to the number of colormap entries.	 Actual RGB values
are always passed in the protocol within a 16-bit spectrum,
with 0 being minimum intensity and 65535 being the maximum
intensity.  On hardware that provides a linear zero-based
intensity ramp, the following relationship exists:


	  hw-intensity = protocol-intensity / (65536 / total-hw-intensities)


Colormap entries are indexed from 0.  The colormap-entries
defines the number of available colormap entries in a newly
created colormap.  For 4mDirectColor24m and 4mTrueColor24m, this will
usually be 2 to the power of the maximum number of bits set
to 1 in red-mask, green-mask, and blue-mask.

This request creates an unmapped window and assigns the
identifier wid to it.

A class of 4mCopyFromParent24m means the class is taken from the
parent.	 A depth of zero for class 4mInputOutput24m or 4mCopy-0m
4mFromParent24m means the depth is taken from the parent.  A
visual of 4mCopyFromParent24m means the visual type is taken from
the parent.  For class 4mInputOutput24m, the visual type and
depth must be a combination supported for the screen (or a
4mMatch24m error results).  The depth need not be the same as the
parent, but the parent must not be of class 4mInputOnly24m (or a



			     1m170m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


4mMatch24m error results).  For class 4mInputOnly24m, the depth must
be zero (or a 4mMatch24m error results), and the visual must be
one supported for the screen (or a 4mMatch24m error results).
However, the parent can have any depth and class.

The server essentially acts as if 4mInputOnly24m windows do not
exist for the purposes of graphics requests, exposure pro-
cessing, and 4mVisibilityNotify24m events.  An 4mInputOnly24m window
cannot be used as a drawable (as a source or destination for
graphics requests).  4mInputOnly24m and 4mInputOutput24m windows act
identically in other respects-properties, grabs, input con-
trol, and so on.

The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y
axis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-left cor-
ner.  Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, and
coincide with pixel centers.  Each window and pixmap has its
own coordinate system.	For a window, the origin is inside
the border at the inside, upper-left corner.

The x and y coordinates for the window are relative to the
parent's origin and specify the position of the upper-left
outer corner of the window (not the origin).  The width and
height specify the inside size (not including the border)
and must be nonzero (or a 4mValue24m error results).  The border-
width for an 4mInputOnly24m window must be zero (or a 4mMatch24m error
results).

The window is placed on top in the stacking order with
respect to siblings.

The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of the win-
dow that are to be explicitly initialized.  The possible

It is a 4mMatch24m error to specify any other attributes for
4mInputOnly24m windows.

If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the default
background-pixmap.  The background pixmap and the window
must have the same root and the same depth (or a 4mMatch24m error
results).  Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes
may be faster than others.  If background 4mNone24m is specified,
the window has no defined background.  If background



			     1m190m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


4mParentRelative24m is specified, the parent's background is
used, but the window must have the same depth as the parent
(or a 4mMatch24m error results).  If the parent has background
4mNone24m, then the window will also have background 4mNone24m.	 A
copy of the parent's background is not made.  The parent's
background is reexamined each time the window background is
required.  If background-pixel is given, it overrides the
default background-pixmap and any background-pixmap given
explicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size filled with back-
ground-pixel is used for the background.  Range checking is
not performed on the background-pixel value; it is simply
truncated to the appropriate number of bits.  For a 4mParen-0m
4mtRelative24m background, the background tile origin always
aligns with the parent's background tile origin.  Otherwise,
the background tile origin is always the window origin.

When no valid contents are available for regions of a window
and the regions are either visible or the server is main-
taining backing store, the server automatically tiles the
regions with the window's background unless the window has a
background of 4mNone24m.  If the background is 4mNone24m, the previous
screen contents from other windows of the same depth as the
window are simply left in place if the contents come from
the parent of the window or an inferior of the parent; oth-
erwise, the initial contents of the exposed regions are
undefined.  Exposure events are then generated for the
regions, even if the background is 4mNone24m.

The border tile origin is always the same as the background
tile origin.  If border-pixmap is given, it overrides the
default border-pixmap.	The border pixmap and the window
must have the same root and the same depth (or a 4mMatch24m error
results).  Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes
may be faster than others.  If 4mCopyFromParent24m is given, the
parent's border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to the
parent's border attribute do not affect the child), but the
window must have the same depth as the parent (or a 4mMatch0m
error results).	 The pixmap might be copied by sharing the
same pixmap object between the child and parent or by making
a complete copy of the pixmap contents.	 If border-pixel is
given, it overrides the default border-pixmap and any bor-
der-pixmap given explicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size
filled with border-pixel is used for the border.  Range
checking is not performed on the border-pixel value; it is
simply truncated to the appropriate number of bits.

Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of the
window, so that the border is never affected.

The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should be
retained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defines
how the window should be repositioned if the parent is
resized (see 4mConfigureWindow24m request).

A backing-store of 4mWhenMapped24m advises the server that main-
taining contents of obscured regions when the window is
mapped would be beneficial.  A backing-store of 4mAlways0m
advises the server that maintaining contents even when the
window is unmapped would be beneficial.	 In this case, the
server may generate an exposure event when the window is
created.  A value of 4mNotUseful24m advises the server that main-
taining contents is unnecessary, although a server may still
choose to maintain contents while the window is mapped.
Note that if the server maintains contents, then the server
should maintain complete contents not just the region within
the parent boundaries, even if the window is larger than its
parent.	 While the server maintains contents, exposure
events will not normally be generated, but the server may
stop maintaining contents at any time.

If save-under is 4mTrue24m, the server is advised that when this
window is mapped, saving the contents of windows it obscures
would be beneficial.

When the contents of obscured regions of a window are being
maintained, regions obscured by noninferior windows are
included in the destination (and source, when the window is
the source) of graphics requests, but regions obscured by
inferior windows are not included.

The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bit
planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be pre-
served in backing-stores and during save-unders.  The back-
ing-pixel specifies what value to use in planes not covered
by backing-planes.  The server is free to save only the
specified bit planes in the backing-store or save-under and
regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixel
value.	Any bits beyond the specified depth of the window in
these values are simply ignored.

The event-mask defines which events the client is interested
in for this window (or for some event types, inferiors of
the window).  The do-not-propagate-mask defines which events
should not be propagated to ancestor windows when no client
has the event type selected in this window.

The override-redirect specifies whether map and configure
requests on this window should override a 4mSubstructureRedi-0m
4mrect24m on the parent, typically to inform a window manager not
to tamper with the window.

The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects the
true colors of the window.  Servers capable of supporting
multiple hardware colormaps may use this information, and
window managers may use it for 4mInstallColormap24m requests.
The colormap must have the same visual type and root as the
window (or a 4mMatch24m error results).	 If 4mCopyFromParent24m is
specified, the parent's colormap is copied (subsequent



			     1m210m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


changes to the parent's colormap attribute do not affect the
child).	 However, the window must have the same visual type
as the parent (or a 4mMatch24m error results), and the parent
must not have a colormap of 4mNone24m (or a 4mMatch24m error results).
For an explanation of 4mNone24m, see 4mFreeColormap24m request.	 The
colormap is copied by sharing the colormap object between
the child and the parent, not by making a complete copy of
the colormap contents.

If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever the
pointer is in the window.  If 4mNone24m is specified, the par-
ent's cursor will be used when the pointer is in the window,
and any change in the parent's cursor will cause an immedi-
ate change in the displayed cursor.

This request generates a 4mCreateNotify24m event.

The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may be
freed immediately if no further explicit references to them
are to be made.

Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap has
an undefined effect on the window state.  The server might
or might not make a copy of the pixmap.

The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes are
to be changed.	The values and restrictions are the same as
for 4mCreateWindow24m.

Setting a new background, whether by background-pixmap or
background-pixel, overrides any previous background.  Set-
ting a new border, whether by border-pixel or border-pixmap,
overrides any previous border.

Changing the background does not cause the window contents
to be changed.	Setting the border or changing the back-
ground such that the border tile origin changes causes the
border to be repainted.	 Changing the background of a root
window to 4mNone24m or 4mParentRelative24m restores the default back-
ground pixmap.	Changing the border of a root window to
4mCopyFromParent24m restores the default border pixmap.

Changing the win-gravity does not affect the current posi-
tion of the window.

Changing the backing-store of an obscured window to 4mWhen-0m
4mMapped24m or 4mAlways24m or changing the backing-planes, backing-
pixel, or save-under of a mapped window may have no immedi-
ate effect.

Multiple clients can select input on the same window; their
event-masks are disjoint.  When an event is generated, it
will be reported to all interested clients.  However, only
one client at a time can select for 4mSubstructureRedirect24m,
only one client at a time can select for 4mResizeRedirect24m, and
only one client at a time can select for 4mButtonPress24m.  An
attempt to violate these restrictions results in an 4mAccess0m
error.

There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, not
one per client.

Changing the colormap of a window (by defining a new map,
not by changing the contents of the existing map) generates
a 4mColormapNotify24m event.  Changing the colormap of a visible
window might have no immediate effect on the screen (see
4mInstallColormap24m request).

Changing the cursor of a root window to 4mNone24m restores the
default cursor.

The order in which attributes are verified and altered is
server-dependent.  If an error is generated, a subset of the
attributes may have been altered.

			     1m270m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


-----------------------------------------------
1mAttribute	 Type0m

x	       INT16

	       4mOpposite24m}
-----------------------------------------------


The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent's origin
and specify the position of the upper-left outer corner of
the window.  The width and height specify the inside size,
not including the border, and must be nonzero (or a 4mValue0m
error results).	 Those values not specified are taken from
the existing geometry of the window.  Note that changing
just the border-width leaves the outer-left corner of the
window in a fixed position but moves the absolute position
of the window's origin.	 It is a 4mMatch24m error to attempt to
make the border-width of an 4mInputOnly24m window nonzero.

If the override-redirect attribute of the window is 4mFalse0m
and some other client has selected 4mSubstructureRedirect24m on
the parent, a 4mConfigureRequest24m event is generated, and no
further processing is performed.  Otherwise, the following
is performed:

If some other client has selected 4mResizeRedirect24m on the win-
dow and the inside width or height of the window is being
changed, a 4mResizeRequest24m event is generated, and the current
inside width and height are used instead.  Note that the
override-redirect attribute of the window has no effect on
4mResizeRedirect24m and that 4mSubstructureRedirect24m on the parent
has precedence over 4mResizeRedirect24m on the window.

The geometry of the window is changed as specified, the win-
dow is restacked among siblings, and a 4mConfigureNotify24m event
is generated if the state of the window actually changes.
If the inside width or height of the window has actually
changed, then children of the window are affected, according
to their win-gravity.  Exposure processing is performed on
formerly obscured windows (including the window itself and
its inferiors if regions of them were obscured but now are
not).  Exposure processing is also performed on any new
regions of the window (as a result of increasing the width
or height) and on any regions where window contents are
lost.

If the inside width or height of a window is not changed but
the window is moved or its border is changed, then the



			     1m280m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


contents of the window are not lost but move with the win-
dow.  Changing the inside width or height of the window
causes its contents to be moved or lost, depending on the
bit-gravity of the window.  It also causes children to be
reconfigured, depending on their win-gravity.  For a change
of width and height of W and H, we define the [x, y] pairs
as:

-----------------------
1mDirection   Deltas0m
-----------------------
4mNorthWest24m	 [0, 0]
4mNorth24m	 [W/2, 0]
4mNorthEast24m	 [W, 0]
4mWest24m	 [0, H/2]
4mCenter24m	 [W/2, H/2]
4mEast24m	 [W, H/2]
4mSouthWest24m	 [0, H]
4mSouth24m	 [W/2, H]
4mSouthEast24m	 [W, H]
-----------------------


When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized,
the corresponding pair defines the change in position of
each pixel in the window.  When a window with one of these
win-gravities has its parent window resized, the correspond-
ing pair defines the change in position of the window within
the parent.  This repositioning generates a 4mGravityNotify0m
event.	4mGravityNotify24m events are generated after the 4mConfig-0m
4mureNotify24m event is generated.

A gravity of 4mStatic24m indicates that the contents or origin
should not move relative to the origin of the root window.
If the change in size of the window is coupled with a change
in position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change in
position of each pixel is [-X, -Y] and for win-gravity the
change in position of a child when its parent is so resized
is [-X, -Y].  Note that 4mStatic24m gravity still only takes
effect when the width or height of the window is changed,
not when the window is simply moved.

A bit-gravity of 4mForget24m indicates that the window contents
are always discarded after a size change, even if backing-
store or save-under has been requested.	 The window is tiled
with its background (except, if no background is defined,
the existing screen contents are not altered) and zero or
more exposure events are generated.

The contents and borders of inferiors are not affected by
their parent's bit-gravity.  A server is permitted to ignore
the specified bit-gravity and use 4mForget24m instead.

1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


A win-gravity of 4mUnmap24m is like 4mNorthWest24m, but the child is
also unmapped when the parent is resized, and an 4mUnmapNotify0m
event is generated.  4mUnmapNotify24m events are generated after
the 4mConfigureNotify24m event is generated.

If a sibling and a stack-mode are specified, the window is
restacked as follows:

4mAbove24m	  The window is placed just above the sibling.
4mBelow24m	  The window is placed just below the sibling.
4mTopIf24m	  If the sibling occludes the window, then the
	     window is placed at the top of the stack.
4mBottomIf24m	  If the window occludes the sibling, then the
	     window is placed at the bottom of the stack.
4mOpposite24m	  If the sibling occludes the window, then the
	     window is placed at the top of the stack.	Oth-
	     erwise, if the window occludes the sibling,
	     then the window is placed at the bottom of the
	     stack.


If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified,
the window is restacked as follows:

4mAbove24m	  The window is placed at the top of the stack.
4mBelow24m	  The window is placed at the bottom of the
	     stack.
4mTopIf24m	  If any sibling occludes the window, then the
	     window is placed at the top of the stack.
4mBottomIf24m	  If the window occludes any sibling, then the
	     window is placed at the bottom of the stack.
4mOpposite24m	  If any sibling occludes the window, then the
	     window is placed at the top of the stack.	Oth-
	     erwise, if the window occludes any sibling,
	     then the window is placed at the bottom of the
	     stack.


It is a 4mMatch24m error if a sibling is specified without a
stack-mode or if the window is not actually a sibling.

Note that the computations for 4mBottomIf24m, 4mTopIf24m, and 4mOpposite0m
are performed with respect to the window's final geometry
(as controlled by the other arguments to the request), not
to its initial geometry.

Attempts to configure a root window have no effect.

This request changes the owner, owner window, and last-

effect if the specified time is earlier than the current
last-change time of the specified selection or is later than
the current server time.  Otherwise, the last-change time is
set to the specified time with 4mCurrentTime24m replaced by the
current server time.  If the owner window is specified as
4mNone24m, then the owner of the selection becomes 4mNone24m (that is,
no owner).  Otherwise, the owner of the selection becomes
the client executing the request.  If the new owner (whether
a client or 4mNone24m) is not the same as the current owner and

If pointer-mode is 4mAsynchronous24m, pointer event processing
continues normally.  If the pointer is currently frozen by

If pointer-mode is 4mSynchronous24m, the state of the pointer (as

If a cursor is specified, then it is displayed regardless of
what window the pointer is in.	If no cursor is specified,
then when the pointer is in grab-window or one of its sub-

Otherwise, the cursor for grab-window is displayed.

If a confine-to window is specified, then the pointer will
be restricted to stay contained in that window.	 The con-
fine-to window need have no relationship to the grab-window.
If the pointer is not initially in the confine-to window,
then it is warped automatically to the closest edge (and
enter/leave events are generated normally) just before the
grab activates.	 If the confine-to window is subsequently
reconfigured, the pointer will be warped automatically as
necessary to keep it contained in the window.

This request generates 4mEnterNotify24m and 4mLeaveNotify24m events.

The request fails with status 4mAlreadyGrabbed24m if the pointer

    The grab-window contains the pointer.

time ignoring any passive grabs at or above (towards the
root) the grab-window of the grab just released.  The
request has no effect if the keyboard is not grabbed by the
client or if the keyboard is not frozen as the result of an

For 4mSyncBoth24m, if both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the
client, event processing (for both devices) continues nor-
mally until the next 4mButtonPress24m, 4mButtonRelease24m, 4mKeyPress24m,
or 4mKeyRelease24m event is reported to the client for a grabbed
device (button event for the pointer, key event for the key-
board), at which time the devices again appear to freeze.
However, if the reported event causes the grab to be
released, then the devices do not freeze (but if the other
device is still grabbed, then a subsequent event for it will
still cause both devices to freeze).  4mSyncBoth24m has no effect
unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client.
If the pointer or keyboard is frozen twice by the client on
behalf of two separate grabs, 4mSyncBoth24m thaws for both (but a
subsequent freeze for 4mSyncBoth24m will only freeze each device
once).

For 4mAsyncBoth24m, if the pointer and the keyboard are frozen by
the client, event processing for both devices continues nor-
mally.	If a device is frozen twice by the client on behalf
of two separate grabs, 4mAsyncBoth24m thaws for both.  4mAsyncBoth0m
has no effect unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by
the client.

4mAsyncPointer24m, 4mSyncPointer24m, and 4mReplayPointer24m have no effect

It is possible for both a pointer grab and a keyboard grab
to be active simultaneously (by the same or different
clients).  When a device is frozen on behalf of either grab,
no event processing is performed for the device.  It is pos-

grabs.	In this case, the freeze must be released on behalf

the pointer to [dst-x, dst-y] relative to dst-window's ori-

takes place if src-window contains the pointer and the
pointer is contained in the specified rectangle of src-win-

If a window is specified as the focus, it becomes the key-

normally be reported to this window or one of its inferiors,
the event is reported normally.	 Otherwise, the event is
reported with respect to the focus window.

If 4mPointerRoot24m is specified as the focus, the focus window
is dynamically taken to be the root window of whatever
screen the pointer is on at each keyboard event.  In this
case, the revert-to argument is ignored.

This request generates 4mFocusIn24m and 4mFocusOut24m events.

The specified focus window must be viewable at the time of
the request (or a 4mMatch24m error results).  If the focus window
later becomes not viewable, the new focus window depends on
the revert-to argument.	 If revert-to is 4mParent24m, the focus
reverts to the parent (or the closest viewable ancestor) and
the new revert-to value is taken to be 4mNone24m.  If revert-to
is 4mPointerRoot24m or 4mNone24m, the focus reverts to that value.
When the focus reverts, 4mFocusIn24m and 4mFocusOut24m events are gen-
erated, but the last-focus-change time is not affected.

|__    Errors: 4mFont0m


This request returns logical information about a font.	If a
gcontext is given for font, the currently contained font is
used.

The draw-direction is just a hint and indicates whether most
char-infos have a positive, 4mLeftToRight24m, or a negative,
4mRightToLeft24m, character-width metric.  The core protocol
defines no support for vertical text.

If min-byte1 and max-byte1 are both zero, then min-char-or-
byte2 specifies the linear character index corresponding to
the first element of char-infos, and max-char-or-byte2 spec-
ifies the linear character index of the last element.  If
either min-byte1 or max-byte1 are nonzero, then both min-
char-or-byte2 and max-char-or-byte2 will be less than 256,
and the 2-byte character index values corresponding to char-
infos element N (counting from 0) are:





			     1m520m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


     byte1 = N/D + min-byte1
     byte2 = N\\D + min-char-or-byte2


where:

     D = max-char-or-byte2 - min-char-or-byte2 + 1
     / = integer division
     \\ = integer modulus


If char-infos has length zero, then min-bounds and max-
bounds will be identical, and the effective char-infos is
one filled with this char-info, of length:

     L = D * (max-byte1 - min-byte1 + 1)


That is, all glyphs in the specified linear or matrix range
have the same information, as given by min-bounds (and max-
bounds).  If all-chars-exist is 4mTrue24m, then all characters in
char-infos have nonzero bounding boxes.

The default-char specifies the character that will be used
when an undefined or nonexistent character is used.  Note
that default-char is a CARD16, not CHAR2B.  For a font using
2-byte matrix format, the default-char has byte1 in the most
significant byte and byte2 in the least significant byte.
If the default-char itself specifies an undefined or nonex-
istent character, then no printing is performed for an unde-
fined or nonexistent character.

The min-bounds and max-bounds contain the minimum and maxi-
mum values of each individual CHARINFO component over all
char-infos (ignoring nonexistent characters).  The bounding
box of the font (that is, the smallest rectangle enclosing
the shape obtained by superimposing all characters at the
same origin [x,y]) has its upper-left coordinate at:

     [x + min-bounds.left-side-bearing, y - max-bounds.ascent]

with a width of:

     max-bounds.right-side-bearing - min-bounds.left-side-bearing


and a height of:

     max-bounds.ascent + max-bounds.descent


The font-ascent is the logical extent of the font above the
baseline and is used for determining line spacing.  Specific
characters may extend beyond this.  The font-descent is the



			     1m530m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


logical extent of the font at or below the baseline and is
used for determining line spacing.  Specific characters may
extend beyond this.  If the baseline is at Y-coordinate y,
then the logical extent of the font is inclusive between the
Y-coordinate values (y - font-ascent) and (y + font-descent
- 1).

A font is not guaranteed to have any properties.  The inter-
pretation of the property value (for example, INT32, CARD32)
must be derived from 4ma24m 4mpriori24m knowledge of the property.  A
basic set of font properties is specified in the X.Org stan-
dard 4mX24m 4mLogical24m 4mFont24m 4mDescription24m 4mConventions24m.

For a character origin at [x,y], the bounding box of a char-
acter (that is, the smallest rectangle enclosing the charac-
ter's shape), described in terms of CHARINFO components, is
a rectangle with its upper-left corner at:

     [x + left-side-bearing, y - ascent]


with a width of:

     right-side-bearing - left-side-bearing


and a height of:

     ascent + descent


and the origin for the next character is defined to be:

     [x + character-width, y]


Note that the baseline is logically viewed as being just
below nondescending characters (when descent is zero, only
pixels with Y-coordinates less than y are drawn) and that
the origin is logically viewed as being coincident with the
left edge of a nonkerned character (when left-side-bearing
is zero, no pixels with X-coordinate less than x are drawn).

Note that CHARINFO metric values can be negative.

A nonexistent character is represented with all CHARINFO
components zero.

The interpretation of the per-character attributes field is
server-dependent.

This request returns the logical extents of the specified

The draw-direction, font-ascent, and font-descent are the
same as described in 4mQueryFont24m.  The overall-ascent is the
maximum of the ascent metrics of all characters in the
string, and the overall-descent is the maximum of the
descent metrics.  The overall-width is the sum of the char-
acter-width metrics of all characters in the string.  For
each character in the string, let W be the sum of the char-
acter-width metrics of all characters preceding it in the
string, let L be the left-side-bearing metric of the charac-
ter plus W, and let R be the right-side-bearing metric of
the character plus W.  The overall-left is the minimum L of
all characters in the string, and the overall-right is the
maximum R.

For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte
matrix indexing, the server will interpret each CHAR2B as a
16-bit number that has been transmitted most significant
byte first (that is, byte1 of the CHAR2B is taken as the
most significant byte).

Characters with all zero metrics are ignored.  If the font
has no defined default-char, then undefined characters in
the string are also ignored.

In graphics operations, given a source and destination
pixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bits
of the pixels; that is, a Boolean operation is performed in
each bit plane.	 The plane-mask restricts the operation to a
subset of planes, so the result is:


     ((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))

ground, background, or plane-mask.  They are simply trun-

The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater than
or equal to one, a wide line, or the special value zero, a
thin line.

Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by the
graphics request.  Unless otherwise specified by the join or
cap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints
[x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with vertices
at the following real coordinates:

     [x1-(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1-(w*cs/2)],
     [x2-(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2-(w*cs/2)]


The sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is the
cosine of the angle of the line.  A pixel is part of the
line (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fully
inside the bounding box, which is viewed as having infinite-
ly thin edges.	If the center of the pixel is exactly on the
bounding box, it is part of the line if and only if the
interior is immediately to its right (x increasing direc-
tion).	Pixels with centers on a horizontal edge are a spe-
cial case and are part of the line if and only if the inte-
rior or the boundary is immediately below (y increasing
direction) and if the interior or the boundary is immedi-
ately to the right (x increasing direction).  Note that this
description is a mathematical model describing the pixels
that are drawn for a wide line and does not imply that
trigonometry is required to implement such a model.  Real or
fixed point arithmetic is recommended for computing the cor-
ners of the line endpoints for lines greater than one pixel
in width.

Thin lines (zero line-width) are nominally one pixel wide
lines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependent algo-
rithm.	There are only two constraints on this algorithm.
First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2]
and another line is drawn unclipped from [x1+dx,y1+dy] to
[x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] is touched by drawing the
first line if and only if the point [x+dx,y+dy] is touched
by drawing the second line.  Second, the effective set of
points comprising a line cannot be affected by clipping.
Thus, a point is touched in a clipped line if and only if



			     1m600m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


the point lies inside the clipping region and the point
would be touched by the line when drawn unclipped.

Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] always
draws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to
[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style.	 Implemen-
tors are encouraged to make this property true for thin
lines, but it is not required.	A line-width of zero may
differ from a line-width of one in which pixels are drawn.
In general, drawing a thin line will be faster than drawing
a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mix well
aesthetically with wide lines because of the different draw-
ing algorithms.	 If it is desirable to obtain precise and
uniform results across all displays, a client should always
use a line-width of one, rather than a line-width of zero.

The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:

4mSolid24m	  The full path of the line is drawn.
4mDoubleDash24m	  The full path of the line is drawn, but the
	     even dashes are filled differently than the odd
	     dashes (see fill-style), with 4mButt24m cap-style
	     used where even and odd dashes meet.
4mOnOffDash24m	  Only the even dashes are drawn, and cap-style
	     applies to all internal ends of the individual
	     dashes (except 4mNotLast24m is treated as 4mButt24m).


The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:

4mNotLast24m	  The result is equivalent to 4mButt24m, except that
	     for a line-width of zero the final endpoint is
	     not drawn.
4mButt24m	  The result is square at the endpoint (perpen-
	     dicular to the slope of the line) with no pro-
	     jection beyond.
4mRound24m	  The result is a circular arc with its diameter
	     equal to the line-width, centered on the end-
	     point; it is equivalent to 4mButt24m for line-width
	     zero.
4mProjecting24m	  The result is square at the end, but the path
	     continues beyond the endpoint for a distance
	     equal to half the line-width; it is equivalent
	     to 4mButt24m for line-width zero.


The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:

4mMiter24m	  The outer edges of the two lines extend to meet
	     at an angle.  However, if the angle is less
	     than 11 degrees, a 4mBevel24m join-style is used
	     instead.





			     1m610m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


4mRound24m	  The result is a circular arc with a diameter
	     equal to the line-width, centered on the join-
	     point.
4mBevel24m	  The result is 4mButt24m endpoint styles, and then
	     the triangular notch is filled.


For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), when
the cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semantics
depends on the line-width and the cap-style:

4mNotLast24m	  thin	  This is device-dependent, but the desired
		     effect is that nothing is drawn.
4mButt24m	  thin	  This is device-dependent, but the desired
		     effect is that a single pixel is drawn.
4mRound24m	  thin	  This is the same as 4mButt24m/thin.
4mProjecting24m	  thin	  This is the same as 4mButt24m/thin.
4mButt24m	  wide	  Nothing is drawn.
4mRound24m	  wide	  The closed path is a circle, centered at
		     the endpoint and with a diameter equal to
		     the line-width.
4mProjecting24m	  wide	  The closed path is a square, aligned with
		     the coordinate axes, centered at the end-
		     point and with sides equal to the line-
		     width.


For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), when
the join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, the
effect is as if the line was removed from the overall path.
However, if the total path consists of (or is reduced to) a
single point joined with itself, the effect is the same as
when the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.

The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensional
plane with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.
When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in a
graphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instance
of the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within the draw-
able specified by the tile/stipple origin.  The tile/stipple
and clip origins are interpreted relative to the origin of
whatever destination drawable is specified in a graphics
request.

The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as the
gcontext (or a 4mMatch24m error results).  The stipple pixmap
must have depth one and must have the same root as the gcon-
text (or a 4mMatch24m error results).  For fill-style 4mStippled0m
(but not fill-style 4mOpaqueStippled24m), the stipple pattern is
tiled in a single plane and acts as an additional clip mask
to be ANDed with the clip-mask.	 Any size pixmap can be used
for tiling or stippling, although some sizes may be faster
to use than others.




			     1m620m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,
text, and fill requests.  For all text and fill requests
(for example, 4mPolyText824m, 4mPolyText1624m, 4mPolyFillRectangle24m,
4mFillPoly24m, and 4mPolyFillArc24m) as well as for line requests with
line-style 4mSolid24m, (for example, 4mPolyLine24m, 4mPolySegment24m,
4mPolyRectangle24m, 4mPolyArc24m) and for the even dashes for line
requests with line-style 4mOnOffDash24m or 4mDoubleDash24m:

4mSolid24m	    Foreground
4mTiled24m	    Tile
4mOpaqueStip-24m    A tile with the same width and height as
4mpled24m	    stipple but with background everywhere stip-
	       ple has a zero and with foreground everywhere
	       stipple has a one
4mStippled24m	    Foreground masked by stipple


For the odd dashes for line requests with line-style 4mDou-0m
4mbleDash24m:

4mSolid24m	    Background
4mTiled24m	    Same as for even dashes
4mOpaqueStip-24m    Same as for even dashes
4mpled0m
4mStippled24m	    Background masked by stipple


The dashes value allowed here is actually a simplified form
of the more general patterns that can be set with 4mSetDashes24m.
Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to specifying the
two element list [N, N] in 4mSetDashes24m.  The value must be
nonzero (or a 4mValue24m error results).  The meaning of dash-
offset and dashes are explained in the 4mSetDashes24m request.

The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.
Only pixels where the clip-mask has bits set to 1 are drawn.
Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by the clip-
mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0.	The clip-
mask affects all graphics requests, but it does not clip
sources.  The clip-mask origin is interpreted relative to
the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in
a graphics request.  If a pixmap is specified as the clip-
mask, it must have depth 1 and have the same root as the
gcontext (or a 4mMatch24m error results).  If clip-mask is 4mNone24m,
then pixels are always drawn, regardless of the clip origin.
The clip-mask can also be set with the 4mSetClipRectangles0m
request.

For 4mClipByChildren24m, both source and destination windows are
additionally clipped by all viewable 4mInputOutput24m children.
For 4mIncludeInferiors24m, neither source nor destination window
is clipped by inferiors.  This will result in including sub-
window contents in the source and drawing through subwindow
boundaries of the destination.	The use of 4mIncludeInferiors0m



			     1m630m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


with a source or destination window of one depth with mapped
inferiors of differing depth is not illegal, but the seman-
tics is undefined by the core protocol.

The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (that is, are
drawn) for paths given in 4mFillPoly24m requests.  4mEvenOdd24m means
a point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as ori-
gin crosses the path an odd number of times.  For 4mWinding24m, a
point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin
crosses an unequal number of clockwise and counterclockwise
directed path segments.	 A clockwise directed path segment
is one that crosses the ray from left to right as observed
from the point.	 A counter-clockwise segment is one that
crosses the ray from right to left as observed from the
point.	The case where a directed line segment is coincident
with the ray is uninteresting because one can simply choose
a different ray that is not coincident with a segment.

For both fill rules, a point is infinitely small and the
path is an infinitely thin line.  A pixel is inside if the
center point of the pixel is inside and the center point is
not on the boundary.  If the center point is on the bound-
ary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygon interior
is immediately to its right (x increasing direction).  Pix-
els with centers along a horizontal edge are a special case
and are inside if and only if the polygon interior is imme-
diately below (y increasing direction).

The arc-mode controls filling in the 4mPolyFillArc24m request.

The graphics-exposures flag controls 4mGraphicsExposure24m event
generation for 4mCopyArea24m and 4mCopyPlane24m requests (and any sim-
ilar requests defined by extensions).

Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result in
a copy being made.  If the pixmap is later used as the des-
tination for a graphics request, the change might or might
not be reflected in the gcontext.  If the pixmap is used
simultaneously in a graphics request as both a destination
and as a tile or stipple, the results are not defined.

It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext information
will be cached in display hardware and that such hardware
can only cache a small number of gcontexts.  Given the num-
ber and complexity of components, clients should view
switching between gcontexts with nearly identical state as
significantly more expensive than making minor changes to a
single gcontext.

This request sets dash-offset and dashes in gc for dashed
line styles.  Dashes cannot be empty (or a 4mValue24m error
results).  Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent to
specifying the same list concatenated with itself to produce
an even-length list.  The initial and alternating elements
of dashes are the even dashes; the others are the odd
dashes.	 Each element specifies a dash length in pixels.
All of the elements must be nonzero (or a 4mValue24m error
results).  The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,
specifying how many pixels into dashes the pattern should
actually begin in any single graphics request.	Dashing is
continuous through path elements combined with a join-style
but is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence of
joined lines.

The unit of measure for dashes is the same as in the ordi-
nary coordinate system.	 Ideally, a dash length is measured



			     1m660m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


along the slope of the line, but implementations are only
required to match this ideal for horizontal and vertical
lines.	Failing the ideal semantics, it is suggested that
the length be measured along the major axis of the line.
The major axis is defined as the x axis for lines drawn at
an angle of between -45 and +45 degrees or between 135 and
225 degrees from the x axis.  For all other lines, the major
axis is the y axis.

For any graphics primitive, the computation of the endpoint
of an individual dash only depends on the geometry of the
primitive, the start position of the dash, the direction of
the dash, and the dash length.

For any graphics primitive, the total set of pixels used to
render the primitive (both even and odd numbered dash ele-
ments) with 4mDoubleDash24m line-style is the same as the set of
pixels used to render the primitive with 4mSolid24m line-style.

For any graphics primitive, if the primitive is drawn with
4mOnOffDash24m or 4mDoubleDash24m line-style unclipped at position
[x,y] and again at position [x+dx,y+dy], then a point
[x1,y1] is included in a dash in the first instance if and
only if the point [x1+dx,y1+dy] is included in the dash in
the second instance.  In addition, the effective set of
points comprising a dash cannot be affected by clipping.  A
point is included in a clipped dash if and only if the point
lies inside the clipping region and the point would be
included in the dash when drawn unclipped.

This request draws circular or elliptical arcs.	 Each arc is
specified by a rectangle and two angles.  The angles are
signed integers in degrees scaled by 64, with positive indi-
cating counterclockwise motion and negative indicating
clockwise motion.  The start of the arc is specified by
angle1 relative to the three-o'clock position from the cen-
ter of the rectangle, and the path and extent of the arc is
specified by angle2 relative to the start of the arc.  If
the magnitude of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, it is
truncated to 360 degrees.  The x and y coordinates of the
rectangle are relative to the origin of the drawable.  For
an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the origin of the major
and minor axes is at [x+(w/2),y+(h/2)], and the infinitely
thin path describing the entire circle/ellipse intersects
the horizontal axis at [x,y+(h/2)] and [x+w,y+(h/2)] and
intersects the vertical axis at [x+(w/2),y] and
[x+(w/2),y+h].	These coordinates are not necessarily inte-
gral; that is, they are not truncated to discrete coordi-
nates.

For a wide line with line-width lw, the ideal bounding out-
lines for filling are given by the two infinitely thin paths
consisting of all points whose perpendicular distance from a
tangent to the path of the circle/ellipse is equal to lw/2
(which may be a fractional value).  When the width and
height of the arc are not equal and both are nonzero, then
the actual bounding outlines are implementation dependent.
However, the computation of the shape and position of the
bounding outlines (relative to the center of the arc) only
depends on the width and height of the arc and the line-
width.

The cap-style is applied the same as for a line correspond-
ing to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at the endpoint.
When the angle of an arc face is not an integral multiple of



			     1m730m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


90 degrees, and the width and height of the arc are both are
nonzero, then the shape and position of the cap at that face
is implementation dependent.  However, for a 4mButt24m cap, the
face is defined by a straight line, and the computation of
the position (relative to the center of the arc) and the
slope of the line only depends on the width and height of
the arc and the angle of the arc face.	For other cap
styles, the computation of the position (relative to the
center of the arc) and the shape of the cap only depends on
the width and height of the arc, the line-width, the angle
of the arc face, and the direction (clockwise or counter
clockwise) of the arc from the endpoint.

The join-style is applied the same as for two lines corre-
sponding to the tangents of the circles/ellipses at the join
point.	When the width and height of both arcs are nonzero,
and the angle of either arc face is not an integral multiple
of 90 degrees, then the shape of the join is implementation
dependent.  However, the computation of the shape only
depends on the width and height of each arc, the line-width,
the angles of the two arc faces, the direction (clockwise or
counter clockwise) of the arcs from the join point, and the
relative orientation of the two arc center points.

For an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the angles must be
specified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of the
ellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems are
identical).  The relationship between these angles and
angles expressed in the normal coordinate system of the
screen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:

     skewed-angle = atan(tan(normal-angle) * w/h) + adjust


The skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians
(rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2*PI).
The atan returns a value in the range [-PI/2,PI/2].  The
adjust is:

     0	    for normal-angle in the range [0,PI/2)
     PI	    for normal-angle in the range [PI/2,(3*PI)/2)
     2*PI   for normal-angle in the range [(3*PI)/2,2*PI)


The arcs are drawn in the order listed.	 If the last point
in one arc coincides with the first point in the following
arc, the two arcs will join correctly.	If the first point
in the first arc coincides with the last point in the last
arc, the two arcs will join correctly.	For any given arc,
no pixel is drawn more than once.  If two arcs join cor-
rectly and the line-width is greater than zero and the arcs
intersect, no pixel is drawn more than once.  Otherwise, the
intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs are drawn multiple
times.	Specifying an arc with one endpoint and a clockwise

extent draws the same pixels as specifying the other end-
point and an equivalent counterclockwise extent, except as
it affects joins.

By specifying one axis to be zero, a horizontal or vertical
line can be drawn.

Angles are computed based solely on the coordinate system,
ignoring the aspect ratio.

multiple of 90 degrees, then the precise endpoint on the arc
is implementation dependent.  However, for 4mChord24m arc-mode,
the computation of the pair of endpoints (relative to the
center of the arc) only depends on the width and height of

angle of the arc face for that endpoint and the ratio of the
arc width to arc height.

are used within each set; zero values are ignored.  All of
the nonzero keycodes must be in the range specified by min-

use of the corresponding modifier is disabled, and the modi-
fier bit will always be zero.  Otherwise, the modifier bit
will be one whenever at least one of the keys in the corre-
sponding set is in the down position.

A server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
changed (for example, if certain keys do not generate up
transitions in hardware, if auto-repeat cannot be disabled
on certain keys, or if multiple keys per modifier are not
supported).  The status reply is 4mFailed24m if some such
restriction is violated, and none of the modifiers is
changed.

|__    Errors: 4mValue0m


This request sets the mapping of the pointer.  Elements of
the list are indexed starting from one.	 The length of the
list must be the same as 4mGetPointerMapping24m would return (or
a 4mValue24m error results).  The index is a core button number,
and the element of the list defines the effective number.

A zero element disables a button.  Elements are not
restricted in value by the number of physical buttons, but
no two elements can have the same nonzero value (or a 4mValue0m
error results).

If any of the buttons to be altered are logically in the
down state, the status reply is 4mBusy24m, and the mapping is not
changed.

This request generates a 4mMappingNotify24m event on a 4mSuccess0m
status.

This request defines how the pointer moves.  The accelera-
tion is a multiplier for movement expressed as a fraction.
For example, specifying 3/1 means the pointer moves three
times as fast as normal.  The fraction can be rounded arbi-
trarily by the server.	Acceleration only takes effect if
the pointer moves more than threshold number of pixels at
once and only applies to the amount beyond the threshold.
Setting a value to -1 restores the default.  Other negative

screen-saver is disabled (but an activated screen-saver is
not deactivated).  If the timeout value is nonzero, screen-
saver is enabled.  Once screen-saver is enabled, if no input
from the keyboard or pointer is generated for timeout sec-
onds, screen-saver is activated.  For each screen, if blank-
ing is preferred and the hardware supports video blanking,
the screen will simply go blank.  Otherwise, if either

If the server-dependent screen-saver method is amenable to
periodic change, interval serves as a hint about how long
the change period should be, with zero hinting that no peri-

|__    Errors: 4mAccess24m, 4mValue0m


This request adds or removes the specified host from the
access control list.  When the access control mechanism is
enabled and a client attempts to establish a connection to
the server, the host on which the client resides must be in
the access control list, or the client must have been
granted permission by a server-dependent method, or the
server will refuse the connection.

The client must reside on the same host as the server and/or
have been granted permission by a server-dependent method to
execute this request (or an 4mAccess24m error results).

An initial access control list can usually be specified,
typically by naming a file that the server reads at startup
and reset.

The following address families are defined.  A server is not
required to support these families and may support families
not listed here.  Use of an unsupported family, an improper
address format, or an improper address length within a sup-
ported family results in a 4mValue24m error.

Note that use of a host address in the ChangeHosts request
is deprecated.	It is only useful when a host has a unique,
constant address, a requirement that is increasingly unmet
as sites adopt dynamically assigned addresses, network
address translation gateways, IPv6 link local addresses, and
various other technologies.  It also assumes all users of a
host share equivalent access rights, and as such has never
been suitable for many multi-user machine environments.
Instead, more secure forms of authentication, such as those
based on shared secrets or public key encryption, are recom-
mended.

For the Internet family, the address must be four bytes
long.  The address bytes are in standard IP order; the
server performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.
The Internet family supports IP version 4 addresses only.

For the InternetV6 family, the address must be sixteen bytes
long.  The address bytes are in standard IP order; the
server performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.
The InternetV6 family supports IP version 6 addresses only.

For the DECnet family, the server performs no automatic
swapping on the address bytes.	A Phase IV address is two



			     1m1020m

bytes long: the first byte contains the least significant
eight bits of the node number, and the second byte contains
the most significant two bits of the node number in the
least significant two bits of the byte and the area in the
most significant six bits of the byte.

For the Chaos family, the address must be two bytes long.
The host number is always the first byte in the address, and
the subnet number is always the second byte.  The server
performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.

1m10.  Connection Close0m

At connection close, all event selections made by the client
are discarded.	If the client has the pointer actively
grabbed, an 4mUngrabPointer24m is performed.  If the client has
the keyboard actively grabbed, an 4mUngrabKeyboard24m is per-
formed.	 All passive grabs by the client are released.	If
the client has the server grabbed, an 4mUngrabServer24m is per-
formed.	 All selections (see 4mSetSelectionOwner24m request)
owned by the client are disowned.  If close-down mode (see
4mSetCloseDownMode24m request) is 4mRetainPermanent24m or 4mRetainTempo-0m
4mrary24m, then all resources (including colormap entries) allo-
cated by the client are marked as permanent or temporary,
respectively (but this does not prevent other clients from
explicitly destroying them).  If the mode is 4mDestroy24m, all of
the client's resources are destroyed.

When a client's resources are destroyed, for each window in
the client's save-set, if the window is an inferior of a
window created by the client, the save-set window is



			     1m1040m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


reparented to the closest ancestor such that the save-set
window is not an inferior of a window created by the client.
If the save-set window is unmapped, a 4mMapWindow24m request is
performed on it (even if it was not an inferior of a window
created by the client).	 The reparenting leaves unchanged
the absolute coordinates (with respect to the root window)
of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set window.
After save-set processing, all windows created by the client
are destroyed.	For each nonwindow resource created by the
client, the appropriate 4mFree24m request is performed.	 All col-
ors and colormap entries allocated by the client are freed.

A server goes through a cycle of having no connections and
having some connections.  At every transition to the state
of having no connections as a result of a connection closing
with a 4mDestroy24m close-down mode, the server resets its state
as if it had just been started.	 This starts by destroying
all lingering resources from clients that have terminated in
4mRetainPermanent24m or 4mRetainTemporary24m mode.  It additionally
includes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,
deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting all
device maps and attributes (key click, bell volume, acceler-
ation), resetting the access control list, restoring the
standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the default font
path, and restoring the input focus to state 4mPointerRoot24m.

Note that closing a connection with a close-down mode of
4mRetainPermanent24m or 4mRetainTemporary24m will not cause the server
to reset.

1m11.  Events0m

When a button press is processed with the pointer in some
window W and no active pointer grab is in progress, the
ancestors of W are searched from the root down, looking for
a passive grab to activate.  If no matching passive grab on
the button exists, then an active grab is started automati-
cally for the client receiving the event, and the last-
pointer-grab time is set to the current server time.  The
effect is essentially equivalent to a 4mGrabButton24m with argu-
ments:

-----------------------------------------------------------

These events are generated either when a key or button logi-
cally changes state or when the pointer logically moves.
The generation of these logical changes may lag the physical
changes if device event processing is frozen.  Note that
4mKeyPress24m and 4mKeyRelease24m are generated for all keys, even
those mapped to modifier bits.	The source of the event is
the window the pointer is in.  The window the event is
reported with respect to is called the event window.  The
event window is found by starting with the source window and
looking up the hierarchy for the first window on which any
client has selected interest in the event (provided no
intervening window prohibits event generation by including
the event type in its do-not-propagate-mask).  The actual
window used for reporting can be modified by active grabs
and, in the case of keyboard events, can be modified by the
focus window.

The root is the root window of the source window, and root-x
and root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root's
origin at the time of the event.  Event is the event window.
If the event window is on the same screen as root, then
event-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative to
the event window's origin.  Otherwise, event-x and event-y
are zero.  If the source window is an inferior of the event

1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


window, then child is set to the child of the event window
that is an ancestor of (or is) the source window.  Other-
wise, it is set to 4mNone24m.  The state component gives the log-
ical state of the buttons and modifier keys just before the
event.	The detail component type varies with the event
type:

--------------------------------------
1mEvent			 Component0m
--------------------------------------
4mKeyPress24m, 4mKeyRelease24m	 KEYCODE
4mButtonPress24m, 4mButton-24m	 BUTTON
4mRelease0m
4mMotionNotify24m	    {4mNormal24m, 4mHint24m}
--------------------------------------


4mMotionNotify24m events are only generated when the motion
begins and ends in the window.	The granularity of motion
events is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motion
events is guaranteed to get at least one event when the
pointer moves and comes to rest.  Selecting 4mPointerMotion0m
receives events independent of the state of the pointer but-
tons.  By selecting some subset of 4mButton[1-5]Motion0m
instead, 4mMotionNotify24m events will only be received when one
or more of the specified buttons are pressed.  By selecting
4mButtonMotion24m, 4mMotionNotify24m events will be received only when
at least one button is pressed.	 The events are always of
type 4mMotionNotify24m, independent of the selection.  If 4mPoint-0m
4merMotionHint24m is selected, the server is free to send only
one 4mMotionNotify24m event (with detail 4mHint24m) to the client for
the event window until either the key or button state
changes, the pointer leaves the event window, or the client
issues a 4mQueryPointer24m or 4mGetMotionEvents24m request.

and 4mLeaveNotify24m events are generated instead of a 4mMotionNo-0m
4mtify24m event.  Only clients selecting 4mEnterWindow24m on a window
receive 4mEnterNotify24m events, and only clients selecting
4mLeaveWindow24m receive 4mLeaveNotify24m events.  The pointer posi-
tion reported in the event is always the final position, not
the initial position of the pointer.  The root is the root
window for this position, and root-x and root-y are the
pointer coordinates relative to root's origin at the time of
the event.  Event is the event window.	If the event window
is on the same screen as root, then event-x and event-y are
the pointer coordinates relative to the event window's ori-
gin.  Otherwise, event-x and event-y are zero.	In a
4mLeaveNotify24m event, if a child of the event window contains
the initial position of the pointer, then the child compo-
nent is set to that child.  Otherwise, it is 4mNone24m.	 For an
4mEnterNotify24m event, if a child of the event window contains
the final pointer position, then the child component is set
to that child.	Otherwise, it is 4mNone24m.  If the event window
is the focus window or an inferior of the focus window, then
focus is 4mTrue24m.  Otherwise, focus is 4mFalse24m.

Normal pointer motion events have mode 4mNormal24m.  Pseudo-
motion events when a grab activates have mode 4mGrab24m, and
pseudo-motion events when a grab deactivates have mode
4mUngrab24m.

All 4mEnterNotify24m and 4mLeaveNotify24m events caused by a hierarchy
change are generated after any hierarchy event caused by
that change (that is, 4mUnmapNotify24m, 4mMapNotify24m, 4mConfigureNo-0m
4mtify24m, 4mGravityNotify24m, 4mCirculateNotify24m), but the ordering of
4mEnterNotify24m and 4mLeaveNotify24m events with respect to 4mFocusOut24m,
4mVisibilityNotify24m, and 4mExpose24m events is not constrained.

When a pointer grab activates (but after any initial warp
into a confine-to window and before generating any actual
4mButtonPress24m event that activates the grab), G is the grab-
window for the grab, and P is the window the pointer is in:

    4mEnterNotify24m and 4mLeaveNotify24m events with mode 4mGrab24m are

tities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap, as nec-
essary.	 The data always consists of either 20 8-bit values

message types might not make use of all of these values.

1m12.  Flow Control and Concurrency0m

Whenever the server is writing to a given connection, it is
permissible for the server to stop reading from that connec-
tion (but if the writing would block, it must continue to
service other connections).  The server is not required to
buffer more than a single request per connection at one
time.  For a given connection to the server, a client can
block while reading from the connection but should undertake
to read (events and errors) when writing would block.  Fail-
ure on the part of a client to obey this rule could result
in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock is probably
unlikely unless either the transport layer has very little
buffering or the client attempts to send large numbers of
requests without ever reading replies or checking for errors
and events.

Whether or not a server is implemented with internal concur-
rency, the overall effect must be as if individual requests
are executed to completion in some serial order, and
requests from a given connection must be executed in deliv-
ery order (that is, the total execution order is a shuffle
of the individual streams).  The execution of a request

However, it does not include the actual transmission of the
reply and the events.  In addition, the effect of any other
cause that can generate multiple events (for example, acti-
vation of a grab or pointer motion) must effectively gener-
ate and queue all required events indivisibly with respect

caused by executing the request must be sent to the client
before any reply or error is sent.

		      1mKEYSYM Encoding0m



For convenience, KEYSYM values are viewed as split into four
bytes:

    Byte 1 (for the purposes of this encoding) is the most-
     significant 5 bits (because of the 29-bit effective
     values)

    Byte 2 is the next most-significant 8 bits

    Byte 3 is the next most-significant 8 bits

    Byte 4 is the least-significant 8 bits

There are two special KEYSYM values: 4mNoSymbol24m and 4mVoidSym-0m
4mbol24m.  They are used to indicate the absence of symbols (see
section 5).

  0	  255	   255	    255	    4mVoidSymbol0m
-----------------------------------------------

All other standard KEYSYM values have zero values for bytes
1 and 2.  Byte 3 indicates a character code set, and byte 4
indicates a particular character within that set.

Each character set contains gaps where codes have been
removed that were duplicates with codes in previous charac-
ter sets (that is, character sets with lesser byte 3 value).

The 94 and 96 character code sets have been moved to occupy
the right-hand quadrant (decimal 129 through 256), so the
ASCII subset has a unique encoding across byte 4, which cor-
responds to the ASCII character code.  However, this cannot
be guaranteed with future registrations and does not apply
to all of the Keyboard set.

To the best of our knowledge, the Latin, Kana, Arabic,
Cyrillic, Greek, APL, and Hebrew sets are from the appropri-
ate ISO and/or ECMA international standards.  There are no
Technical, Special, or Publishing international standards,
so these sets are based on Digital Equipment Corporation
standards.

The ordering between the sets (byte 3) is essentially arbi-
trary.	National and international standards bodies were
commencing deliberations regarding international 2-byte and
4-byte character sets at the time these keysyms were devel-
oped, but we did not know of any proposed layouts.

The order may be arbitrary, but it is important in dealing
with duplicate coding.	As far as possible, keysym values
(byte 4) follow the character set encoding standards, except
for the Greek and Cyrillic keysyms which are based on early
draft standards.  In the Latin-1 to Latin-4 sets, all dupli-
cate glyphs occupy the same code position.  However, dupli-
cates between Greek and Technical do not occupy the same
code position.	Applications that wish to use the Latin-2,
Latin-3, Latin-4, Greek, Cyrillic, or Technical sets may
find it convenient to use arrays to transform the keysyms.

There is a difference between European and US usage of the
names Pilcrow, Paragraph, and Section, as follows:

We have adopted the US names (by accident rather than by
design).

The Keyboard set is a miscellaneous collection of commonly
occurring keys on keyboards.  Within this set, the keypad
symbols are generally duplicates of symbols found on keys on
the main part of the keyboard, but they are distinguished
here because they often have a distinguishable semantics
associated with them.

Keyboards tend to be comparatively standard with respect to
the alphanumeric keys, but they differ radically on the mis-
cellaneous function keys.  Many function keys are left over
from early timesharing days or are designed for a specific
application.  Keyboard layouts from large manufacturers tend
to have lots of keys for every conceivable purpose, whereas
small workstation manufacturers often add keys that are
solely for support of some of their unique functionality.
There are two ways of thinking about how to define keysyms
for such a world:

    The Engraving approach

    The Common approach

The Engraving approach is to create a keysym for every
unique key engraving.  This is effectively taking the union
of all key engravings on all keyboards.	 For example, some
keyboards label function keys across the top as F1 through
Fn, and others label them as PF1 through PFn.  These would
be different keys under the Engraving approach.	 Likewise,
Lock would differ from Shift Lock, which is different from
the up-arrow symbol that has the effect of changing lower-
case to uppercase.  There are lots of other aliases such as
Del, DEL, Delete, Remove, and so forth.	 The Engraving
approach makes it easy to decide if a new entry should be
added to the keysym set:  if it does not exactly match an
existing one, then a new one is created.  One estimate is
that there would be on the order of 300-500 Keyboard keysyms
using this approach, without counting foreign translations
and variations.

The Common approach tries to capture all of the keys present
on an interesting number of keyboards, folding likely
aliases into the same keysym.  For example, Del, DEL, and
Delete are all merged into a single keysym.  Vendors would
be expected to augment the keysym set (using the vendor-spe-
cific encoding space) to include all of their unique keys



			     1m1260m

that were not included in the standard set.  Each vendor
decides which of its keys map into the standard keysyms,
which presumably can be overridden by a user.  It is more
difficult to implement this approach, because judgment is
required about when a sufficient set of keyboards implements
an engraving to justify making it a keysym in the standard
set and about which engravings should be merged into a sin-
gle keysym.  Under this scheme there are an estimated
100-150 keysyms.

Although neither scheme is perfect or elegant, the Common
approach has been selected because it makes it easier to
write a portable application.  Having the Delete functional-
ity merged into a single keysym allows an application to
implement a deletion function and expect reasonable bindings
on a wide set of workstations.	Under the Common approach,
application writers are still free to look for and interpret
vendor-specific keysyms, but because they are in the
extended set, the application developer is more conscious
that they are writing the application in a nonportable fash-
ion.

In the listings below, Code Pos is a representation of byte
4 of the KEYSYM value, expressed as most-significant/least-
significant 4-bit values.  The Code Pos numbers are for ref-
erence only and do not affect the KEYSYM value.	 In all
cases, the KEYSYM value is:

			 1mAppendix B0m

		     1mProtocol Encoding0m




1mSyntactic Conventions0m

All numbers are in decimal, unless prefixed with #x, in
which case they are in hexadecimal (base 16).

The general syntax used to describe requests, replies,
errors, events, and compound types is:


     4mNameofThing0m
       encode-form
       ...
       encode-form


Each encode-form describes a single component.

For components described in the protocol as:


     name: TYPE


the encode-form is:


     N	       TYPE name


N is the number of bytes occupied in the data stream, and
TYPE is the interpretation of those bytes.  For example,


     depth: CARD8


becomes:


     1	       CARD8	      depth


For components with a static numeric value the encode-form
is:




			     1m1520m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


     N	       value	      name


The value is always interpreted as an N-byte unsigned inte-
ger.  For example, the first two bytes of a 4mWindow24m error are
always zero (indicating an error in general) and three
(indicating the 4mWindow24m error in particular):


     1	       0    Error
     1	       3    code


For components described in the protocol as:

     name: {4mName124m,..., 4mNameI24m}

the encode-form is:


     N		    name
	       value1 Name1
	       ...
	       valueI NameI


The value is always interpreted as an N-byte unsigned inte-
ger.  Note that the size of N is sometimes larger than that
strictly required to encode the values.	 For example:

     class: {4mInputOutput24m, 4mInputOnly24m, 4mCopyFromParent24m}

becomes:


     2			      class
	       0    CopyFromParent
	       1    InputOutput
	       2    InputOnly


For components described in the protocol as:

     NAME: TYPE or 4mAlternative124m...or 4mAlternativeI0m

the encode-form is:


     N	       TYPE	      NAME
	       value1	 Alternative1
	       ...
	       valueI	 AlternativeI





			     1m1530m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


The alternative values are guaranteed not to conflict with
the encoding of TYPE.  For example:

     destination: WINDOW or 4mPointerWindow24m or 4mInputFocus0m

becomes:


     4	       WINDOW	      destination
	       0    PointerWindow
	       1    InputFocus


For components described in the protocol as:


     value-mask: BITMASK


the encode-form is:


     N	       BITMASK	      value-mask
	       mask1	 mask-name1
	       ...
	       maskI	 mask-nameI


The individual bits in the mask are specified and named, and
N is 2 or 4.  The most-significant bit in a BITMASK is
reserved for use in defining chained (multiword) bitmasks,
as extensions augment existing core requests.  The precise
interpretation of this bit is not yet defined here, although
a probable mechanism is that a 1-bit indicates that another
N bytes of bitmask follows, with bits within the overall
mask still interpreted from least-significant to most-sig-
nificant with an N-byte unit, with N-byte units interpreted
in stream order, and with the overall mask being byte-
swapped in individual N-byte units.

For LISTofVALUE encodings, the request is followed by a sec-
tion of the form:


     VALUEs
      encode-form
      ...
      encode-form


listing an encode-form for each VALUE.	The NAME in each
encode-form keys to the corresponding BITMASK bit.  The
encoding of a VALUE always occupies four bytes, but the num-
ber of bytes specified in the encoding-form indicates how



			     1m1540m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


many of the least-significant bytes are actually used; the
remaining bytes are unused and their values do not matter.

In various cases, the number of bytes occupied by a compo-
nent will be specified by a lowercase single-letter variable
name instead of a specific numeric value, and often some
other component will have its value specified as a simple
numeric expression involving these variables.  Components
specified with such expressions are always interpreted as
unsigned integers.  The scope of such variables is always
just the enclosing request, reply, error, event, or compound
type structure.	 For example:


     2	       3+n	      request length
     4n	       LISTofPOINT    points


For unused bytes (the values of the bytes are undefined and
do no matter), the encode-form is:


     N			 unused


If the number of unused bytes is variable, the encode-form
typically is:


     p			 unused, p=pad(E)


where E is some expression, and pad(E) is the number of
bytes needed to round E up to a multiple of four.


     pad(E) = (4 - (E mod 4)) mod 4


1mCommon Types0m

LISTofFOO

     In this document the LISTof notation strictly means
     some number of repetitions of the FOO encoding; the
     actual length of the list is encoded elsewhere.

SETofFOO

     A set is always represented by a bitmask, with a 1-bit
     indicating presence in the set.

For TCP connections, displays on a given host are numbered
starting from 0, and the server for display N listens and
accepts connections on port 6000 + N.  For DECnet connec-
tions, displays on a given host are numbered starting from
0, and the server for display N listens and accepts connec-
tions on the object name obtained by concatenating ``X$X''
with the decimal representation of N, for example, X$X0 and
X$X1.

1mAccess control list0m

     X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs
     can be run.  By default, only programs on the local
     host and hosts specified in an initial list read by the
     server can use the display.  Clients on the local host
     can change this access control list.  Some server
     implementations can also implement other authorization
     mechanisms in addition to or in place of this mecha-
     nism.  The action of this mechanism can be conditional
     based on the authorization protocol name and data
     received by the server at connection setup.

1mActive grab0m

     A grab is active when the pointer or keyboard is actu-
     ally owned by the single grabbing client.

1mAncestors0m

     If W is an inferior of A, then A is an ancestor of W.

1mAtom0m

     An atom is a unique ID corresponding to a string name.
     Atoms are used to identify properties, types, and
     selections.

1mBackground0m

     An 4mInputOutput24m window can have a background, which is
     defined as a pixmap.  When regions of the window have
     their contents lost or invalidated, the server will
     automatically tile those regions with the background.

1mBacking store0m

     When a server maintains the contents of a window, the
     pixels saved off screen are known as a backing store.












			     1m2170m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mBit gravity0m

     When a window is resized, the contents of the window
     are not necessarily discarded.  It is possible to
     request that the server relocate the previous contents
     to some region of the window (though no guarantees are
     made).  This attraction of window contents for some
     location of a window is known as bit gravity.

1mBit plane0m

     When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of
     bitmaps, each bitmap is called a bit plane or plane.

1mBitmap0m

     A bitmap is a pixmap of depth one.

1mBorder0m

     An 4mInputOutput24m window can have a border of equal thick-
     ness on all four sides of the window.  A pixmap defines
     the contents of the border, and the server automati-
     cally maintains the contents of the border.  Exposure
     events are never generated for border regions.

1mButton grabbing0m

     Buttons on the pointer may be passively grabbed by a
     client.  When the button is pressed, the pointer is
     then actively grabbed by the client.

1mByte order0m

     For image (pixmap/bitmap) data, the server defines the
     byte order, and clients with different native byte
     ordering must swap bytes as necessary.  For all other
     parts of the protocol, the client defines the byte
     order, and the server swaps bytes as necessary.

1mChildren0m

     The children of a window are its first-level subwin-
     dows.













			     1m2180m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mClient0m

     An application program connects to the window system
     server by some interprocess communication path, such as
     a TCP connection or a shared memory buffer.  This pro-
     gram is referred to as a client of the window system
     server.  More precisely, the client is the communica-
     tion path itself; a program with multiple paths open to
     the server is viewed as multiple clients by the proto-
     col.  Resource lifetimes are controlled by connection
     lifetimes, not by program lifetimes.

1mClipping region0m

     In a graphics context, a bitmap or list of rectangles
     can be specified to restrict output to a particular
     region of the window.  The image defined by the bitmap
     or rectangles is called a clipping region.

1mColormap0m

     A colormap consists of a set of entries defining color
     values.  The colormap associated with a window is used
     to display the contents of the window; each pixel value
     indexes the colormap to produce RGB values that drive
     the guns of a monitor.  Depending on hardware limita-
     tions, one or more colormaps may be installed at one
     time, so that windows associated with those maps dis-
     play with correct colors.

1mConnection0m

     The interprocess communication path between the server
     and client program is known as a connection.  A client
     program typically (but not necessarily) has one connec-
     tion to the server over which requests and events are
     sent.

1mContainment0m

     A window ``contains'' the pointer if the window is
     viewable and the hotspot of the cursor is within a vis-
     ible region of the window or a visible region of one of
     its inferiors.  The border of the window is included as
     part of the window for containment.  The pointer is
     ``in'' a window if the window contains the pointer but
     no inferior contains the pointer.










			     1m2190m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mCoordinate system0m

     The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the
     Y axis vertical, with the origin [0, 0] at the upper
     left.  Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels,
     and coincide with pixel centers.  Each window and
     pixmap has its own coordinate system.  For a window,
     the origin is inside the border at the inside upper
     left.

1mCursor0m

     A cursor is the visible shape of the pointer on a
     screen.  It consists of a hot spot, a source bitmap, a
     shape bitmap, and a pair of colors.  The cursor defined
     for a window controls the visible appearance when the
     pointer is in that window.

1mDepth0m

     The depth of a window or pixmap is the number of bits
     per pixel that it has.  The depth of a graphics context
     is the depth of the drawables it can be used in con-
     junction with for graphics output.

1mDevice0m

     Keyboards, mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes,
     and so on are all collectively known as input devices.
     The core protocol only deals with two devices, ``the
     keyboard'' and ``the pointer.''

1mDirectColor0m

     4mDirectColor24m is a class of colormap in which a pixel
     value is decomposed into three separate subfields for
     indexing.	The first subfield indexes an array to pro-
     duce red intensity values.	 The second subfield indexes
     a second array to produce blue intensity values.  The
     third subfield indexes a third array to produce green
     intensity values.	The RGB values can be changed dynam-
     ically.

1mDisplay0m

     A server, together with its screens and input devices,
     is called a display.










			     1m2200m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mDrawable0m

     Both windows and pixmaps can be used as sources and
     destinations in graphics operations.  These windows and
     pixmaps are collectively known as drawables.  However,
     an 4mInputOnly24m window cannot be used as a source or des-
     tination in a graphics operation.

1mEvent0m

     Clients are informed of information asynchronously by
     means of events.  These events can be generated either
     asynchronously from devices or as side effects of
     client requests.  Events are grouped into types.  The
     server never sends events to a client unless the client
     has specificially asked to be informed of that type of
     event.  However, other clients can force events to be
     sent to other clients.  Events are typically reported
     relative to a window.

1mEvent mask0m

     Events are requested relative to a window.	 The set of
     event types that a client requests relative to a window
     is described by using an event mask.

1mEvent synchronization0m

     There are certain race conditions possible when demul-
     tiplexing device events to clients (in particular
     deciding where pointer and keyboard events should be
     sent when in the middle of window management opera-
     tions).  The event synchronization mechanism allows
     synchronous processing of device events.

1mEvent propagation0m

     Device-related events propagate from the source window
     to ancestor windows until some client has expressed
     interest in handling that type of event or until the
     event is discarded explicitly.

1mEvent source0m

     The window the pointer is in is the source of a device-
     related event.

1mExposure event0m

     Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of
     windows when windows are obscured or reconfigured.
     Exposure events are sent to clients to inform them when
     contents of regions of windows have been lost.




			     1m2210m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mExtension0m

     Named extensions to the core protocol can be defined to
     extend the system.	 Extension to output requests,
     resources, and event types are all possible and are
     expected.

1mFocus window0m

     The focus window is another term for the input focus.

1mFont0m

     A font is a matrix of glyphs (typically characters).
     The protocol does no translation or interpretation of
     character sets.  The client simply indicates values
     used to index the glyph array.  A font contains addi-
     tional metric information to determine interglyph and
     interline spacing.

1mGC22m, 1mGContext0m

     GC and gcontext are abbreviations for graphics context.

1mGlyph0m

     A glyph is an image, typically of a character, in a
     font.

1mGrab0m

     Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the
     pointer, and the server can be grabbed for exclusive
     use by a client.  In general, these facilities are not
     intended to be used by normal applications but are
     intended for various input and window managers to
     implement various styles of user interfaces.

1mGraphics context0m

     Various information for graphics output is stored in a
     graphics context such as foreground pixel, background
     pixel, line width, clipping region, and so on.  A
     graphics context can only be used with drawables that
     have the same root and the same depth as the graphics
     context.

1mGravity0m

     See 1mbit gravity 22mand 1mwindow gravity22m.







			     1m2220m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mGrayScale0m

     4mGrayScale24m can be viewed as a degenerate case of 4mPseudo-0m
     4mColor24m, in which the red, green, and blue values in any
     given colormap entry are equal, thus producing shades
     of gray.  The gray values can be changed dynamically.

1mHotspot0m

     A cursor has an associated hotspot that defines the
     point in the cursor corresponding to the coordinates
     reported for the pointer.

1mIdentifier0m

     An identifier is a unique value associated with a
     resource that clients use to name that resource.  The
     identifier can be used over any connection.

1mInferiors0m

     The inferiors of a window are all of the subwindows
     nested below it: the children, the children's children,
     and so on.

1mInput focus0m

     The input focus is normally a window defining the scope
     for processing of keyboard input.	If a generated key-
     board event would normally be reported to this window
     or one of its inferiors, the event is reported nor-
     mally.  Otherwise, the event is reported with respect
     to the focus window.  The input focus also can be set
     such that all keyboard events are discarded and such
     that the focus window is dynamically taken to be the
     root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at
     each keyboard event.

1mInput manager0m

     Control over keyboard input is typically provided by an
     input manager client.

1mInputOnly window0m

     An 4mInputOnly24m window is a window that cannot be used for
     graphics requests.	 4mInputOnly24m windows are invisible and
     can be used to control such things as cursors, input
     event generation, and grabbing.  4mInputOnly24m windows can-
     not have 4mInputOutput24m windows as inferiors.







			     1m2230m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mInputOutput window0m

     An 4mInputOutput24m window is the normal kind of opaque win-
     dow, used for both input and output.  4mInputOutput24m win-
     dows can have both 4mInputOutput24m and 4mInputOnly24m windows as
     inferiors.

1mKey grabbing0m

     Keys on the keyboard can be passively grabbed by a
     client.  When the key is pressed, the keyboard is then
     actively grabbed by the client.

1mKeyboard grabbing0m

     A client can actively grab control of the keyboard, and
     key events will be sent to that client rather than the
     client the events would normally have been sent to.

1mKeysym0m

     An encoding of a symbol on a keycap on a keyboard.

1mMapped0m

     A window is said to be mapped if a map call has been
     performed on it.  Unmapped windows and their inferiors
     are never viewable or visible.

1mModifier keys0m

     Shift, Control, Meta, Super, Hyper, Alt, Compose,
     Apple, CapsLock, ShiftLock, and similar keys are called
     modifier keys.

1mMonochrome0m

     Monochrome is a special case of 4mStaticGray24m in which
     there are only two colormap entries.

1mObscure0m

     A window is obscured if some other window obscures it.
     Window A obscures window B if both are viewable
     4mInputOutput24m windows, A is higher in the global stacking
     order, and the rectangle defined by the outside edges
     of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside
     edges of B.  Note the distinction between obscure and
     occludes.	Also note that window borders are included
     in the calculation and that a window can be obscured
     and yet still have visible regions.






			     1m2240m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mOcclude0m

     A window is occluded if some other window occludes it.
     Window A occludes window B if both are mapped, A is
     higher in the global stacking order, and the rectangle
     defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rec-
     tangle defined by the outside edges of B.	Note the
     distinction between occludes and obscures.	 Also note
     that window borders are included in the calculation.

1mPadding0m

     Some padding bytes are inserted in the data stream to
     maintain alignment of the protocol requests on natural
     boundaries.  This increases ease of portability to some
     machine architectures.

1mParent window0m

     If C is a child of P, then P is the parent of C.

1mPassive grab0m

     Grabbing a key or button is a passive grab.  The grab
     activates when the key or button is actually pressed.

1mPixel value0m

     A pixel is an N-bit value, where N is the number of bit
     planes used in a particular window or pixmap (that is,
     N is the depth of the window or pixmap).  For a window,
     a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual
     color to be displayed.

1mPixmap0m

     A pixmap is a three-dimensional array of bits.  A
     pixmap is normally thought of as a two-dimensional
     array of pixels, where each pixel can be a value from 0
     to (2^N)-1 and where N is the depth (z axis) of the
     pixmap.  A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of
     N bitmaps.

1mPlane0m

     When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of
     bitmaps, each bitmap is called a plane or bit plane.










			     1m2250m





1mX Protocol				X11, Release 6.7 DRAFT0m


1mPlane mask0m

     Graphics operations can be restricted to only affect a
     subset of bit planes of a destination.  A plane mask is
     a bit mask describing which planes are to be modified.
     The plane mask is stored in a graphics context.

1mPointer0m

     The pointer is the pointing device attached to the cur-
     sor and tracked on the screens.

1mPointer grabbing0m

     A client can actively grab control of the pointer.
     Then button and motion events will be sent to that
     client rather than the client the events would normally
     have been sent to.

1mPointing device0m

     A pointing device is typically a mouse, tablet, or some
     other device with effective dimensional motion.  There
     is only one visible cursor defined by the core proto-
     col, and it tracks whatever pointing device is attached
     as the pointer.

1mProperty0m

     Windows may have associated properties, which consist
     of a name, a type, a data format, and some data.  The
     protocol places no interpretation on properties.  They
     are intended as a general-purpose naming mechanism for
     clients.  For example, clients might use properties to
     share information such as resize hints, program names,
     and icon formats with a window manager.

1mProperty list0m

     The property list of a window is the list of properties
     that have been defined for the window.

1mPseudoColor0m

     4mPseudoColor24m is a class of colormap in which a pixel
     value indexes the colormap to produce independent red,
     green, and blue values; that is, the colormap is viewed
     as an array of triples (RGB values).  The RGB values
     can be changed dynamically.

1mRedirecting control0m

     Window managers (or client programs) may want to
     enforce window layout policy in various ways.  When a
     client attempts to change the size or position of a
     window, the operation may be redirected to a specified
     client rather than the operation actually being per-
     formed.

1mReply0m

     Information requested by a client program is sent back
     to the client with a reply.  Both events and replies
     are multiplexed on the same connection.  Most requests
     do not generate replies, although some requests gener-
     ate multiple replies.

1mRequest0m

     A command to the server is called a request.  It is a
     single block of data sent over a connection.

1mResource0m

     Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, graphics contexts,
     and colormaps are known as resources.  They all have
     unique identifiers associated with them for naming pur-
     poses.  The lifetime of a resource usually is bounded
     by the lifetime of the connection over which the
     resource was created.

1mRGB values0m

     Red, green, and blue (RGB) intensity values are used to
     define color.  These values are always represented as
     16-bit unsigned numbers, with 0 being the minimum
     intensity and 65535 being the maximum intensity.  The
     server scales the values to match the display hardware.

1mRoot0m

     The root of a pixmap, colormap, or graphics context is
     the same as the root of whatever drawable was used when
     the pixmap, colormap, or graphics context was created.
     The root of a window is the root window under which the
     window was created.

1mRoot window0m

     Each screen has a root window covering it.	 It cannot
     be reconfigured or unmapped, but it otherwise acts as a
     full-fledged window.  A root window has no parent.

1mSave set0m

     The save set of a client is a list of other clients'
     windows that, if they are inferiors of one of the
     client's windows at connection close, should not be
     destroyed and that should be remapped if currently
     unmapped.	Save sets are typically used by window man-
     agers to avoid lost windows if the manager terminates
     abnormally.

1mScanline0m

     A scanline is a list of pixel or bit values viewed as a
     horizontal row (all values having the same y coordi-
     nate) of an image, with the values ordered by increas-
     ing x coordinate.

1mScanline order0m

     An image represented in scanline order contains scan-
     lines ordered by increasing y coordinate.

1mScreen0m

     A server can provide several independent screens, which
     typically have physically independent monitors.  This
     would be the expected configuration when there is only
     a single keyboard and pointer shared among the screens.

1mSelection0m

     A selection can be thought of as an indirect property
     with dynamic type; that is, rather than having the
     property stored in the server, it is maintained by some
     client (the ``owner'').  A selection is global in
     nature and is thought of as belonging to the user
     (although maintained by clients), rather than as being
     private to a particular window subhierarchy or a par-
     ticular set of clients.  When a client asks for the
     contents of a selection, it specifies a selection
     ``target type''.  This target type can be used to con-
     trol the transmitted representation of the contents.
     For example, if the selection is ``the last thing the
     user clicked on'' and that is currently an image, then
     the target type might specify whether the contents of
     the image should be sent in XY format or Z format.	 The
     target type can also be used to control the class of
     contents transmitted; for example, asking for the
     ``looks'' (fonts, line spacing, indentation, and so on)
     of a paragraph selection rather than the text of the
     paragraph.	 The target type can also be used for other
     purposes.	The protocol does not constrain the seman-
     tics.

1mServer0m

     The server provides the basic windowing mechanism.	 It
     handles connections from clients, multiplexes graphics
     requests onto the screens, and demultiplexes input back
     to the appropriate clients.

1mServer grabbing0m

     The server can be grabbed by a single client for exclu-
     sive use.	This prevents processing of any requests
     from other client connections until the grab is com-
     pleted.  This is typically only a transient state for
     such things as rubber-banding, pop-up menus, or to exe-
     cute requests indivisibly.

1mSibling0m

     Children of the same parent window are known as sibling
     windows.

1mStacking order0m

     Sibling windows may stack on top of each other.  Win-
     dows above other windows both obscure and occlude those
     lower windows.  This is similar to paper on a desk.
     The relationship between sibling windows is known as
     the stacking order.

1mStaticColor0m

     4mStaticColor24m can be viewed as a degenerate case of 4mPseu-0m
     4mdoColor24m in which the RGB values are predefined and
     read-only.

1mStaticGray0m

     4mStaticGray24m can be viewed as a degenerate case of
     4mGrayScale24m in which the gray values are predefined and
     read-only.	 The values are typically linear or near-
     linear increasing ramps.

1mStipple0m

     A stipple pattern is a bitmap that is used to tile a
     region that will serve as an additional clip mask for a
     fill operation with the foreground color.

1mString Equivalence0m

     Two ISO Latin-1 STRING8 values are considered equal if
     they are the same length and if corresponding bytes are
     either equal or are equivalent as follows:	 decimal
     values 65 to 90 inclusive (characters ``A'' to ``Z'')
     are pairwise equivalent to decimal values 97 to 122
     inclusive (characters ``a'' to ``z''), decimal values
     192 to 214 inclusive (characters ``A grave'' to ``O
     diaeresis'') are pairwise equivalent to decimal values
     224 to 246 inclusive (characters ``a grave'' to ``o
     diaeresis''), and decimal values 216 to 222 inclusive
     (characters ``O oblique'' to ``THORN'') are pairwise
     equivalent to decimal values 246 to 254 inclusive
     (characters ``o oblique'' to ``thorn'').

1mTile0m

     A pixmap can be replicated in two dimensions to tile a
     region.  The pixmap itself is also known as a tile.

1mTimestamp0m

     A timestamp is a time value, expressed in milliseconds.
     It typically is the time since the last server reset.
     Timestamp values wrap around (after about 49.7 days).
     The server, given its current time is represented by
     timestamp T, always interprets timestamps from clients
     by treating half of the timestamp space as being ear-
     lier in time than T and half of the timestamp space as
     being later in time than T.  One timestamp value (named
     4mCurrentTime24m) is never generated by the server.  This
     value is reserved for use in requests to represent the
     current server time.

1mTrueColor0m

     4mTrueColor24m can be viewed as a degenerate case of 4mDirect-0m
     4mColor24m in which the subfields in the pixel value
     directly encode the corresponding RGB values; that is,
     the colormap has predefined read-only RGB values.	The
     values are typically linear or near-linear increasing
     ramps.

1mType0m

     A type is an arbitrary atom used to identify the inter-
     pretation of property data.  Types are completely unin-
     terpreted by the server and are solely for the benefit
     of clients.

1mViewable0m

     A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are
     mapped.  This does not imply that any portion of the
     window is actually visible.  Graphics requests can be
     performed on a window when it is not viewable, but out-
     put will not be retained unless the server is maintain-
     ing backing store.

1mVisible0m

     A region of a window is visible if someone looking at
     the screen can actually see it; that is, the window is
     viewable and the region is not occluded by any other
     window.

1mWindow gravity0m

     When windows are resized, subwindows may be reposi-
     tioned automatically relative to some position in the
     window.  This attraction of a subwindow to some part of
     its parent is known as window gravity.

1mWindow manager0m

     Manipulation of windows on the screen and much of the
     user interface (policy) is typically provided by a win-
     dow manager client.

1mXYFormat0m

     The data for a pixmap is said to be in XY format if it
     is organized as a set of bitmaps representing individ-
     ual bit planes, with the planes appearing from most-
     significant to least-significant in bit order.

1mZFormat0m

     The data for a pixmap is said to be in Z format if it
     is organized as a set of pixel values in scanline
     order.
