1mNAME0m
       XFree86 - X11R6 X server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXFree86 22m[1m:4m22mdisplay24m] [4moption24m 4m...24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mXFree86 22mis a full featured X server that was originally designed for
       UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems running on Intel x86 hardware.  It
       now runs on a wider range of hardware and OS platforms.

       This work was originally derived from 4mX38624m 4m1.224m by Thomas Roell which
       was contributed to X11R5 by Snitily Graphics Consulting Service.	 The
       1mXFree86 22mserver architecture was redesigned for the 4.0 release, and it
       includes among many other things a loadable module system derived from
       code donated by Metro Link, Inc.	 The current XFree86 release is com-
       patible with X11R6.6.

1mPLATFORMS0m
       1mXFree86 22moperates under a wide range of operating systems and hardware
       platforms.  The Intel x86 (IA32) architecture is the most widely sup-
       ported hardware platform.  Other hardware platforms include Compaq
       Alpha, Intel IA64, SPARC and PowerPC.  The most widely supported oper-
       ating systems are the free/OpenSource UNIX-like systems such as Linux,
       FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.  Commercial UNIX operating systems such as
       Solaris (x86) and UnixWare are also supported.  Other supported operat-
       ing systems include LynxOS, and GNU Hurd.  Darwin and Mac OS X are sup-
       ported with the XDarwin(1) X server.  Win32/Cygwin is supported with
       the XWin X server.


1mNETWORK CONNECTIONS0m
       1mXFree86 22msupports connections made using the following reliable byte-
       streams:

       4mLocal0m
	   On most platforms, the "Local" connection type is a UNIX-domain
	   socket.  On some System V platforms, the "local" connection types
	   also include STREAMS pipes, named pipes, and some other mechanisms.

       4mTCPIP0m
	   1mXFree86 22mlistens on port 6000+4mn24m, where 4mn24m is the display number.
	   This connection type can be disabled with the 1m-nolisten 22moption (see
	   the Xserver(1) man page for details).

1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES0m
       For operating systems that support local connections other than Unix
       Domain sockets (SVR3 and SVR4), there is a compiled-in list specifying
       the order in which local connections should be attempted.  This list
       can be overridden by the 4mXLOCAL24m environment variable described below.
       If the display name indicates a best-choice connection should be made
       (e.g.  1m:0.022m), each connection mechanism is tried until a connection
       succeeds or no more mechanisms are available.  Note: for these OSs, the
       Unix Domain socket connection is treated differently from the other
       local connection types.	To use it the connection must be made to
       1munix:0.022m.

       The 4mXLOCAL24m environment variable should contain a list of one more more
       of the following:

	       NAMED
	       PTS
	       SCO
	       ISC

       which represent SVR4 Named Streams pipe, Old-style USL Streams pipe,
       SCO XSight Streams pipe, and ISC Streams pipe, respectively.  You can
       select a single mechanism (e.g.	4mXLOCAL=NAMED24m), or an ordered list
       (e.g. 4mXLOCAL="NAMED:PTS:SCO"24m).  his variable overrides the compiled-in
       defaults.  For SVR4 it is recommended that 4mNAMED24m be the first prefer-
       ence connection.	 The default setting is 4mPTS:NAMED:ISC:SCO24m.

       To globally override the compiled-in defaults, you should define (and
       export if using 1msh 22mor 1mksh22m) 4mXLOCAL24m globally.  If you use startx(1) or
       xinit(1), the definition should be at the top of your 4m.xinitrc24m file.
       If you use xdm(1), the definitions should be early on in the
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession24m script.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1mXFree86 22msupports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configura-
       tion and run-time parameters: command line options, environment vari-
       ables, the XF86Config(5) configuration file, auto-detection, and fall-
       back defaults.  When the same information is supplied in more than one
       way, the highest precedence mechanism is used.  The list of mechanisms
       is ordered from highest precedence to lowest.  Note that not all param-
       eters can be supplied via all methods.  The available command line
       options and environment variables (and some defaults) are described
       here and in the Xserver(1) manual page.	Most configuration file param-
       eters, with their defaults, are described in the XF86Config(5) manual
       page.  Driver and module specific configuration parameters are
       described in the relevant driver or module manual page.

       Starting with version 4.4, 1mXFree86 22mhas support for generating a usable
       configuration at run-time when no XF86Config(5) configuration file is
       provided.  The initial version of this automatic configuration support
       is targeted at the most popular hardware and software platforms sup-
       ported by XFree86.  Some details about how this works can be found in
       the 1mCONFIGURATION 22msection below and in the getconfig(1) manual page.

       In addition to the normal server options described in the Xserver(1)
       manual page, 1mXFree86 22maccepts the following command line switches:

       1mvt4m22mXX24m	 4mXX24m specifies the Virtual Terminal device number which 1mXFree860m
	       will use.  Without this option, 1mXFree86 22mwill pick the first
	       available Virtual Terminal that it can locate.  This option
	       applies only to platforms such as Linux, BSD, SVR3 and SVR4,
	       that have virtual terminal support.

       1m-allowMouseOpenFail0m
	       Allow the server to start up even if the mouse device can't be
	       opened or initialised.  This is equivalent to the 1mAllow-0m
	       1mMouseOpenFail 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

       1m-allowNonLocalModInDev0m
	       Allow changes to keyboard and mouse settings from non-local
	       clients.	 By default, connections from non-local clients are
	       not allowed to do this.	This is equivalent to the 1mAllowNonLo-0m
	       1mcalModInDev 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

       1m-allowNonLocalXvidtune0m
	       Make the VidMode extension available to remote clients.	This
	       allows the xvidtune client to connect from another host.	 This
	       is equivalent to the 1mAllowNonLocalXvidtune 22mXF86Config(5) file
	       option.	By default non-local connections are not allowed.

       1m-appendauto0m
	       Append the automatic XFree86 server configuration data to an
	       existing configuration file.  By default this is only done when
	       an existing configuration file does not contain any 1mServerLay-0m
	       1mout 22msections or any 1mScreen 22msections.  This can be useful for
	       providing configuration details for things not currently han-
	       dled by the automatic configuration mechanism, such as input
	       devices, font paths, etc.

       1m-autoconfig0m
	       Use automatic XFree86 server configuration, even if a configu-
	       ration file is available.  By default automatic configuration
	       is only used when a configuration file cannot be found.

       1m-bgamma 4m22mvalue0m
	       Set the blue gamma correction.  4mvalue24m must be between 0.1 and
	       10.  The default is 1.0.	 Not all drivers support this.	See
	       also the 1m-gamma22m, 1m-rgamma22m, and 1m-ggamma 22moptions.

       1m-bpp 4m22mn24m	 No longer supported.  Use 1m-depth 22mto set the color depth, and
	       use 1m-fbbpp 22mif you really need to force a non-default frame-
	       buffer (hardware) pixel format.

       1m-configure0m
	       When this option is specified, the 1mXFree86 22mserver loads all
	       video driver modules, probes for available hardware, and writes
	       out an initial XF86Config(5) file based on what was detected.
	       This option currently has some problems on some platforms, but
	       in most cases it is a good way to bootstrap the configuration
	       process.	 This option is only available when the server is run
	       as root (i.e, with real-uid 0).

       1m-crt /dev/tty4m22mXX0m
	       SCO only.  This is the same as the 1mvt 22moption, and is provided
	       for compatibility with the native SCO X server.

       1m-depth 4m22mn0m
	       Sets the default color depth.  Legal values are 1, 4, 8, 15,
	       16, and 24.  Not all drivers support all values.

       1m-disableModInDev0m
	       Disable dynamic modification of input device settings.  This is
	       equivalent to the 1mDisableModInDev 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

       1m-disableVidMode0m
	       Disable the the parts of the VidMode extension (used by the
	       xvidtune client) that can be used to change the video modes.
	       This is equivalent to the 1mDisableVidModeExtension 22mXF86Config(5)
	       file option.

       1m-fbbpp 4m22mn0m
	       Sets the number of framebuffer bits per pixel.  You should only
	       set this if you're sure it's necessary; normally the server can
	       deduce the correct value from 1m-depth 22mabove.	 Useful if you want
	       to run a depth 24 configuration with a 24 bpp framebuffer
	       rather than the (possibly default) 32 bpp framebuffer (or vice
	       versa).	Legal values are 1, 8, 16, 24, 32.  Not all drivers
	       support all values.

       1m-flipPixels0m
	       Swap the default values for the black and white pixels.

       1m-gamma 4m22mvalue0m
	       Set the gamma correction.  4mvalue24m must be between 0.1 and 10.
	       The default is 1.0.  This value is applied equally to the R, G
	       and B values.  Those values can be set independently with the
	       1m-rgamma22m, 1m-bgamma22m, and 1m-ggamma 22moptions.  Not all drivers support
	       this.

       1m-ggamma 4m22mvalue0m
	       Set the green gamma correction.	4mvalue24m must be between 0.1 and
	       10.  The default is 1.0.	 Not all drivers support this.	See
	       also the 1m-gamma22m, 1m-rgamma22m, and 1m-bgamma 22moptions.

       1m-ignoreABI0m
	       The 1mXFree86 22mserver checks the ABI revision levels of each mod-
	       ule that it loads.  It will normally refuse to load modules
	       with ABI revisions that are newer than the server's.  This is
	       because such modules might use interfaces that the server does
	       not have.  When this option is specified, mismatches like this
	       are downgraded from fatal errors to warnings.  This option
	       should be used with care.

       1m-keeptty0m
	       Prevent the server from detaching its initial controlling ter-
	       minal.  This option is only useful when debugging the server.
	       Not all platforms support (or can use) this option.

       1m-keyboard 4m22mkeyboard-name0m
	       Use the XF86Config(5) file 1mInputDevice 22msection called 4mkeyboard-0m
	       4mname24m as the core keyboard.	This option is ignored when the
	       1mServerLayout 22msection specifies a core keyboard.  In the absence
	       of both a ServerLayout section and this option, the first rele-
	       vant 1mInputDevice 22msection is used for the core keyboard.

       1m-layout 4m22mlayout-name0m
	       Use the XF86Config(5) file 1mServerLayout 22msection called 4mlayout-0m
	       4mname24m.  By default the first 1mServerLayout 22msection is used.

       1m-logfile 4m22mfilename0m
	       Use the file called 4mfilename24m as the 1mXFree86 22mserver log file.
	       The default log file is 1m/var/log/XFree86.4m22mn24m1m.log 22mon most plat-
	       forms, where 4mn24m is the display number of the 1mXFree86 22mserver.
	       The default may be in a different directory on some platforms.
	       This option is only available when the server is run as root
	       (i.e, with real-uid 0).

       1m-logverbose 22m[4mn24m]
	       Sets the verbosity level for information printed to the 1mXFree860m
	       server log file.	 If the 4mn24m value isn't supplied, each occur-
	       rence of this option increments the log file verbosity level.
	       When the 4mn24m value is supplied, the log file verbosity level is
	       set to that value.  The default log file verbosity level is 3.

       1m-modulepath 4m22msearchpath0m
	       Set the module search path to 4msearchpath24m.  4msearchpath24m is a
	       comma separated list of directories to search for 1mXFree860m
	       server modules.	This option is only available when the server
	       is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0).

       1m-noappendauto0m
	       Disable appending the automatic XFree86 server configuration to
	       a partial static configuration.

       1m-nosilk 22mDisable Silken Mouse support.

       1m-pixmap240m
	       Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 24 bits
	       per pixel.  The default is usually 32 bits per pixel.  There is
	       normally little reason to use this option.  Some client appli-
	       cations don't like this pixmap format, even though it is a per-
	       fectly legal format.  This is equivalent to the 1mPixmap 22mXF86Con-
	       fig(5) file option.

       1m-pixmap320m
	       Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 32 bits
	       per pixel.  This is usually the default.	 This is equivalent to
	       the 1mPixmap 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

       1m-pointer 4m22mpointer-name0m
	       Use the XF86Config(5) file 1mInputDevice 22msection called 4mpointer-0m
	       4mname24m as the core pointer.  This option is ignored when the
	       1mServerLayout 22msection specifies a core pointer.  In the absence
	       of both a ServerLayout section and this option, the first rele-
	       vant 1mInputDevice 22msection is used for the core pointer.

       1m-probeonly0m
	       Causes the server to exit after the device probing stage.  The
	       XF86Config(5) file is still used when this option is given, so
	       information that can be auto-detected should be commented out.

       1m-quiet	 22mSuppress most informational messages at startup.  The verbosity
	       level is set to zero.

       1m-rgamma 4m22mvalue0m
	       Set the red gamma correction.  4mvalue24m must be between 0.1 and
	       10.  The default is 1.0.	 Not all drivers support this.	See
	       also the 1m-gamma22m, 1m-bgamma22m, and 1m-ggamma 22moptions.

       1m-scanpci0m
	       When this option is specified, the 1mXFree86 22mserver scans the PCI
	       bus, and prints out some information about each device that was
	       detected.  See also scanpci(1) and pcitweak(1).

       1m-screen 4m22mscreen-name0m
	       Use the XF86Config(5) file 1mScreen 22msection called 4mscreen-name24m.
	       By default the screens referenced by the default 1mServerLayout0m
	       section are used, or the first 1mScreen 22msection when there are no
	       1mServerLayout 22msections.

       1m-showconfig0m
	       This is the same as the 1m-version 22moption, and is included for
	       compatibility reasons.  It may be removed in a future release,
	       so the 1m-version 22moption should be used instead.

       1m-weight 4m22mnnn0m
	       Set RGB weighting at 16 bpp.  The default is 565.  This applies
	       only to those drivers which support 16 bpp.

       1m-verbose 22m[4mn24m]
	       Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr.  If
	       the 4mn24m value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option
	       increments the verbosity level.	When the 4mn24m value is supplied,
	       the verbosity level is set to that value.  The default ver-
	       bosity level is 0.

       1m-version0m
	       Print out the server version, patchlevel, release date, the
	       operating system/platform it was built on, and whether it
	       includes module loader support.

       1m-xf86config 4m22mfile0m
	       Read the server configuration from 4mfile24m.  This option will work
	       for any file when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid
	       0), or for files relative to a directory in the config search
	       path for all other users.

1mKEYBOARD0m
       The 1mXFree86 22mserver is normally configured to recognize various special
       combinations of key presses that instruct the server to perform some
       action, rather than just sending the key press event to a client appli-
       cation.	The default XKEYBOARD keymap defines the key combinations
       listed below.  The server also has these key combinations builtin to
       its event handler for cases where the XKEYBOARD extension is not being
       used.  When using the XKEYBOARD extension, which key combinations per-
       form which actions is completely configurable.

       For more information about when the builtin event handler is used to
       recognize the special key combinations, see the documentation on the
       1mHandleSpecialKeys 22moption in the XF86Config(5) man page.

       The special combinations of key presses recognized directly by 1mXFree860m
       are:

       1mCtrl+Alt+Backspace0m
	       Immediately kills the server -- no questions asked.  This can
	       be disabled with the 1mDontZap 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

       1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus0m
	       Change video mode to next one specified in the configuration
	       file.  This can be disabled with the 1mDontZoom 22mXF86Config(5)
	       file option.

       1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus0m
	       Change video mode to previous one specified in the configura-
	       tion file.  This can be disabled with the 1mDontZoom 22mXF86Con-
	       fig(5) file option.

       1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply0m
	       Not treated specially by default.  If the 1mAllowClosedownGrabs0m
	       XF86Config(5) file option is specified, this key sequence kills
	       clients with an active keyboard or mouse grab as well as
	       killing any application that may have locked the server, nor-
	       mally using the XGrabServer(3) Xlib function.

       1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Divide0m
	       Not treated specially by default.  If the 1mAllowDeactivateGrabs0m
	       XF86Config(5) file option is specified, this key sequence deac-
	       tivates any active keyboard and mouse grabs.

       1mCtrl+Alt+F1...F120m
	       For BSD and Linux systems with virtual terminal support, these
	       keystroke combinations are used to switch to virtual terminals
	       1 through 12, respectively.  This can be disabled with the
	       1mDontVTSwitch 22mXF86Config(5) file option.

1mCONFIGURATION0m
       1mXFree86 22mtypically uses a configuration file called 1mXF86Config 22mfor its
       initial setup.  Refer to the XF86Config(5) manual page for information
       about the format of this file.

       Starting with version 4.4, 1mXFree86 22mhas a mechanism for automatically
       generating a built-in configuration at run-time when no 1mXF86Config 22mfile
       is present.  The current version of this automatic configuration mecha-
       nism works in three ways.

       The first is via enhancements that have made many components of the
       1mXF86Config 22mfile optional.  This means that information that can be
       probed or reasonably deduced doesn't need to be specified explicitly,
       greatly reducing the amount of built-in configuration information that
       needs to be generated at run-time.

       The second is to use an external utility called getconfig(1), when
       available, to use meta-configuration information to generate a suitable
       configuration for the primary video device.  The meta-configuration
       information can be updated to allow an existing installation to get the
       best out of new hardware or to work around bugs that are found post-
       release.

       The third is to have "safe" fallbacks for most configuration informa-
       tion.  This maximises the likelihood that the 1mXFree86 22mserver will start
       up in some usable configuration even when information about the spe-
       cific hardware is not available.

       The automatic configuration support for XFree86 is work in progress.
       It is currently aimed at the most popular hardware and software plat-
       forms supported by XFree86.  Enhancements are planned for future
       releases.

1mFILES0m
       The 1mXFree86 22mserver config file can be found in a range of locations.

1mAUTHORS0m
       XFree86 has many contributors world wide.  The names of most of them
       can be found in the documentation, CHANGELOG files in the source tree,
       and in the actual source code.  The names of the contributors to the
       current release can be found in the release notes
       4m<http://www.xfree86.org/current/RELNOTES.html>24m.

       XFree86 was originally based on 4mX38624m 4m1.224m by Thomas Roell, which was
       contributed to the then X Consortium's X11R5 distribution by SGCS.

       The project that became XFree86 was originally founded in 1992 by David
       Dawes, Glenn Lai, Jim Tsillas and David Wexelblat.

       XFree86 was later integrated in the then X Consortium's X11R6 release
       by a group of dedicated XFree86 developers, including the following:

	   Stuart Anderson, Doug Anson, Gertjan Akkerman, Mike Bernson, Robin
	   Cutshaw, David Dawes, Marc Evans, Pascal Haible, Matthieu Herrb,
	   Dirk Hohndel, David Holland, Alan Hourihane, Jeffrey Hsu, Glenn

       XF86Config - Configuration File for XFree86

1mINTRODUCTION0m
       1mXFree86 22msupports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configura-
       tion and run-time parameters: command line options, environment vari-
       ables, the XF86Config configuration file, auto-detection, and fallback
       defaults.  When the same information is supplied in more than one way,
       the highest precedence mechanism is used.  The list of mechanisms is
       ordered from highest precedence to lowest.  Note that not all parame-
       ters can be supplied via all methods.  The available command line
       options and environment variables (and some defaults) are described in
       the Xserver(1) and XFree86(1) manual pages.  Most configuration file
       parameters, with their defaults, are described below.  Driver and mod-
       ule specific configuration parameters are described in the relevant
       driver or module manual page.

       Starting with version 4.4, 1mXFree86 22mhas support for generating a usable
       configuration at run-time when no 1mXF86Config 22mfile is provided.  The
       initial version of this automatic configuration support is targeted at
       the most popular hardware and software platforms supported by XFree86.
       Some details about how this works can be found in the XFree86(1) and
       getconfig(1) manual pages.

       Starting with version 4.5, it is possible for this automatically gener-
       ated configuration to supplement a partial static configuration.	 The
       partial static configuration can be used to provide non-default config-
       uration details for things that are not currently handled by the auto-
       matic configuration mechanism.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mXFree86 22muses a configuration file called 1mXF86Config 22mfor its initial
       setup.  This configuration file is searched for in the following places
       when the server is started as a normal user:

	   4m/etc/X11/24m<cmdline>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/24m<cmdline>
	   4m/etc/X11/24m1m$XF86CONFIG0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/24m1m$XF86CONFIG0m
	   4m/etc/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/etc/X11/XF86Config0m
	   4m/etc/XF86Config0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config.24m<hostname>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.24m<hostname>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config0m

       where 4m<cmdline>24m is a relative path (with no ".." components) specified
       with the 1m-xf86config 22mcommand line option, 1m$XF86CONFIG 22mis the relative
       path (with no ".." components) specified by that environment variable,
       and 4m<hostname>24m is the machine's hostname as reported by gethostname(3).

       When the XFree86 server is started by the "root" user, the config file
       search locations are as follows:

	   <cmdline>
	   4m/etc/X11/24m<cmdline>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/24m<cmdline>
	   1m$XF86CONFIG0m
	   4m/etc/X11/24m1m$XF86CONFIG0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/24m1m$XF86CONFIG0m
	   1m$HOME4m22m/XF86Config0m
	   4m/etc/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/etc/X11/XF86Config0m
	   4m/etc/XF86Config0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config.24m<hostname>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.24m<hostname>
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config-40m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config0m

       where 4m<cmdline>24m is the path specified with the 1m-xf86config 22mcommand line
       option (which may be absolute or relative), 1m$XF86CONFIG 22mis the path
       specified by that environment variable (absolute or relative), 1m$HOME 22mis
       the path specified by that environment variable (usually the home
       directory), and 4m<hostname>24m is the machine's hostname as reported by
       gethostname(3).

       The 1mXF86Config 22mfile is composed of a number of sections which may be
       present in any order.  Each section has the form:

	   1mSection  "4m22mSectionName24m1m"0m
	       4mSectionEntry0m
	       ...
	   1mEndSection0m

       The section names are:

	   1mFiles	    22mFile pathnames
	   1mServerFlags    22mServer flags
	   1mModule	    22mDynamic module loading
	   1mInputDevice    22mInput device description
	   1mDevice	    22mGraphics device description
	   1mVideoAdaptor   22mXv video adaptor description
	   1mMonitor	    22mMonitor description
	   1mModes	    22mVideo modes descriptions
	   1mScreen	    22mScreen configuration
	   1mServerLayout   22mOverall layout
	   1mDRI	    22mDRI-specific configuration
	   1mVendor	    22mVendor-specific configuration

       The following obsolete section names are still recognised for compati-
       bility purposes.	 In new config files, the 1mInputDevice 22msection should
       be used instead.

	   1mKeyboard	    22mKeyboard configuration
	   1mPointer	    22mPointer/mouse configuration

       The old 1mXInput 22msection is no longer recognised.

       The 1mServerLayout 22msections are at the highest level.	 They bind together
       the input and output devices that will be used in a session.  The input
       devices are described in the 1mInputDevice 22msections.	Output devices usu-
       ally consist of multiple independent components (e.g., and graphics
       board and a monitor).  These multiple components are bound together in
       the 1mScreen 22msections, and it is these that are referenced by the 1mServer-0m
       1mLayout 22msection.  Each 1mScreen 22msection binds together a graphics board
       and a monitor.  The graphics boards are described in the 1mDevice 22msec-
       tions, and the monitors are described in the 1mMonitor 22msections.

       Config file keywords are case-insensitive, and "_" characters are
       ignored.	 Most strings (including 1mOption 22mnames) are also case-insensi-
       tive, and insensitive to white space and "_" characters.

       Each config file entry usually takes up a single line in the file.
       They consist of a keyword, which is possibly followed by one or more
       arguments, with the number and types of the arguments depending on the
       keyword.	 The argument types are:

	   1mInteger	 22man integer number in decimal, hex or octal
	   1mReal	 22ma floating point number
	   1mString	 22ma string enclosed in double quote marks (")

       Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with "0x", and octal values
       with "0".

       A special keyword called 1mOption 22mmay be used to provide free-form data
       to various components of the server.  The 1mOption 22mkeyword takes either
       one or two string arguments.  The first is the option name, and the
       optional second argument is the option value.  Some commonly used
       option value types include:

	   1mInteger	 22man integer number in decimal, hex or octal
	   1mReal	 22ma floating point number
	   1mString	 22ma sequence of characters
	   1mBoolean	 22ma boolean value (see below)
	   1mFrequency	 22ma frequency value (see below)

       Note that 4mall24m 1mOption 22mvalues, not just strings, must be enclosed in
       quotes.

       Boolean options may optionally have a value specified.  When no value
       is specified, the option's value is 1mTRUE22m.  The following boolean option
       values are recognised as 1mTRUE22m:

	   1m122m, 1mon22m, 1mtrue22m, 1myes0m

       and the following boolean option values are recognised as 1mFALSE22m:

	   1m022m, 1moff22m, 1mfalse22m, 1mno0m

       If an option name is prefixed with "1mNo22m", then the option value is
       negated.

       Example: the following option entries are equivalent:

	   1mOption "Accel"   "Off"0m
	   1mOption "NoAccel"0m
	   1mOption "NoAccel" "On"0m
	   1mOption "Accel"   "false"0m
	   1mOption "Accel"   "no"0m

       Frequency option values consist of a real number that is optionally
       followed by one of the following frequency units:

	   1mHz22m, 1mk22m, 1mkHz22m, 1mM22m, 1mMHz0m

       When the unit name is omitted, the correct units will be determined
       from the value and the expectations of the appropriate range of the
       value.  It is recommended that the units always be specified when using
       frequency option values to avoid any errors in determining the value.

1mFILES SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mFiles 22msections.  These are used to
       specify some path names required by the server.	Earlier 1mFiles 22msections
       have priority over later sections.  This means that a path name speci-
       fied in a 1mFiles 22msection cannot be overridden by a later 1mFiles 22msection
       (this behaviour may change in the future).  Some of these paths can
       also be set from the command line (see Xserver(1) and XFree86(1)).  The
       command line settings override the values specified in the config file.
       The 1mFiles 22msection is optional, as are all of the entries that may
       appear in it.

       The entries that can appear in this section are:

       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	      specifies an optional identifying name for the 1mFiles 22msection.

       1mFontPath "4m22mpath24m1m"0m
	      sets the search path for fonts.  This path is a comma separated
	      list of font path elements which the XFree86 server searches for
	      font databases.  Multiple 1mFontPath 22mentries may be specified, and
	      they will be concatenated to build up the fontpath used by the
	      server.  Font path elements may be either absolute directory
	      paths, or a font server identifier.  Font server identifiers
	      have the form:

		  4m<trans>24m/4m<hostname>24m:4m<port-number>0m

	      where 4m<trans>24m is the transport type to use to connect to the
	      font server (e.g., 1munix 22mfor UNIX-domain sockets or 1mtcp 22mfor a
	      TCP/IP connection), 4m<hostname>24m is the hostname of the machine
	      running the font server, and 4m<port-number>24m is the port number
	      that the font server is listening on (usually 7100).

	      When this entry is not specified in the config file, the server
	      falls back to the compiled-in default font path, which contains
	      the following font path elements:

		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/0m

	      The recommended font path contains the following font path ele-
	      ments:

		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/0m
		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/0m

	      Font path elements that are found to be invalid are removed from
	      the font path when the server starts up.

       1mRGBPath "4m22mpath24m1m"0m
	      sets the path name for the RGB color database.  When this entry
	      is not specified in the config file, the server falls back to
	      the compiled-in default RGB path, which is:

		  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb0m

       Note that an implicit 4m.txt24m is added to this path if the server was com-
       piled to use text rather than binary format RGB color databases.

       1mModulePath "4m22mpath24m1m"0m
	      sets the search path for loadable XFree86 server modules.	 This
	      path is a comma separated list of directories which the XFree86
	      server searches for loadable modules loading in the order speci-
	      fied.  Multiple 1mModulePath 22mentries may be specified, and they
	      will be concatenated to build the module search path used by the
	      server.

       1mOptions0m
	      Option flags may be specified in 1mFiles 22msections.

1mSERVERFLAGS SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mServerFlags 22msections.  These are used
       to specify some global XFree86 server options.  Earlier 1mServerFlags0m
       sections have priority over later sections.  This means that an option
       specified in a 1mServerFlags 22msection cannot be overridden by a later
       1mServerFlags 22msection.  Except for the 1mIdentifier 22mentry, all of the
       entries in this section are 1mOptions22m, although for compatibility pur-
       poses some of the old style entries are still recognised.  Those old
       style entries are not documented here, and using them is discouraged.
       The 1mServerFlags 22msection is optional, as are the entries that may be
       specified in it.

       1mOptions 22mspecified in this section (with the exception of the 1m"Default-0m
       1mServerLayout" Option22m) may be overridden by 1mOptions 22mspecified in the
       active 1mServerLayout 22msection.  Options with command line equivalents are
       overridden when their command line equivalent is used.  Entries recog-
       nised by this section are:

       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	      specifies an optional identifying name for the 1mServerFlags 22msec-
	      tion.

       1mOption "DefaultServerLayout"  "4m22mlayout-id24m1m"0m
	      This specifies the default 1mServerLayout 22msection to use in the
	      absence of the 1m-layout 22mcommand line option.

       1mOption "NoTrapSignals"	 "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This prevents the XFree86 server from trapping a range of unex-
	      pected fatal signals and exiting cleanly.	 Instead, the XFree86
	      server will die and drop core where the fault occurred.  The
	      default behaviour is for the XFree86 server to exit cleanly, but
	      still drop a core file.  In general you never want to use this
	      option unless you are debugging an XFree86 server problem and
	      know how to deal with the consequences.

       1mOption "DontVTSwitch"	"4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This disallows the use of the 1mCtrl+Alt+F4m22mn24m sequence (where F4mn0m
	      refers to one of the numbered function keys).  That sequence is
	      normally used to switch to another "virtual terminal" on operat-
	      ing systems that have this feature.  When this option is
	      enabled, that key sequence has no special meaning and is passed
	      to clients.  Default: off.

       1mOption "DontZap"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This disallows the use of the 1mCtrl+Alt+Backspace 22msequence.  That
	      sequence is normally used to terminate the XFree86 server.  When
	      this option is enabled, that key sequence has no special meaning
	      and is passed to clients.	 Default: off.

       1mOption "DontZoom"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This disallows the use of the 1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus 22mand
	      1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus 22msequences.  These sequences allows you to
	      switch between video modes.  When this option is enabled, those
	      key sequences have no special meaning and are passed to clients.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "DisableVidModeExtension"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This disables the parts of the VidMode extension used by the
	      xvidtune client that can be used to change the video modes.
	      Default: the VidMode extension is enabled.

       1mOption "AllowNonLocalXvidtune"	 "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This allows the xvidtune client (and other clients that use the
	      VidMode extension) to connect from another host.	Default: off.

       1mOption "DisableModInDev"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This disables the parts of the XFree86-Misc extension that can
	      be used to modify the input device settings dynamically.
	      Default: that functionality is enabled.

       1mOption "AllowNonLocalModInDev"	 "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This allows a client to connect from another host and change
	      keyboard and mouse settings in the running server.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "AllowMouseOpenFail"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This allows the server to start up even if the mouse device
	      can't be opened/initialised.  Default: false.

       1mOption "VTInit"  "4m22mcommand24m1m"0m
	      Runs 4mcommand24m after the VT used by the server has been opened.
	      The command string is passed to "/bin/sh -c", and is run with
	      the real user's id with stdin and stdout set to the VT.  The
	      purpose of this option is to allow system dependent VT initiali-
	      sation commands to be run.  This option should rarely be needed.
	      Default: not set.

       1mOption "VTSysReq"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      enables the SYSV-style VT switch sequence for non-SYSV systems
	      which support VT switching.  This sequence is 1mAlt-SysRq 22mfollowed
	      by a function key (1mFn22m).  This prevents the XFree86 server trap-
	      ping the keys used for the default VT switch sequence, which
	      means that clients can access them.  Default: off.

       1mOption "XkbDisable" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      disable/enable the XKEYBOARD extension.  The -kb command line
	      option overrides this config file option.	 Default: XKB is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "BlankTime"  "4m22mtime24m1m"0m
	      sets the inactivity timeout for the blanking phase of the
	      screensaver.  4mtime24m is in minutes.  This is equivalent to the
	      XFree86 server's `-s' flag, and the value can be changed at run-
	      time with xset(1).  Default: 10 minutes.

       1mOption "StandbyTime"  "4m22mtime24m1m"0m
	      sets the inactivity timeout for the "standby" phase of DPMS
	      mode.  4mtime24m is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-
	      time with xset(1).  Default: 20 minutes.	This is only suitable
	      for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by
	      all video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens that have the
	      1m"DPMS" 22moption set (see the MONITOR section below).

       1mOption "SuspendTime"  "4m22mtime24m1m"0m
	      sets the inactivity timeout for the "suspend" phase of DPMS
	      mode.  4mtime24m is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-
	      time with xset(1).  Default: 30 minutes.	This is only suitable
	      for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by
	      all video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens that have the
	      1m"DPMS" 22moption set (see the MONITOR section below).

       1mOption "OffTime"  "4m22mtime24m1m"0m
	      sets the inactivity timeout for the "off" phase of DPMS mode.
	      4mtime24m is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time
	      with xset(1).  Default: 40 minutes.  This is only suitable for
	      VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by all
	      video drivers.  It is only enabled for screens that have the
	      1m"DPMS" 22moption set (see the MONITOR section below).

       1mOption "Pixmap"  "4m22mbpp24m1m"0m
	      This sets the pixmap format to use for depth 24.	Allowed values
	      for 4mbpp24m are 24 and 32.  Default: 32 unless driver constraints
	      don't allow this (which is rare).	 Note: some clients don't
	      behave well when this value is set to 24.

       1mOption "PC98"	"4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Specify that the machine is a Japanese PC-98 machine.  This
	      should not be enabled for anything other than the Japanese-spe-
	      cific PC-98 architecture.	 Default: auto-detected.

       1mOption "Log"  "4m22mlogflag24m1m"0m
	      This option enables special handling for log files that may be
	      useful when debugging certain types of problems.	The values for
	      4mlogflag24m are 1mFlush 22mand 1mSync22m.  1mFlush 22mcauses the log file buffer to
	      be flushed after each write.  1mSync 22mcauses the log file buffer to
	      be flushed and the file data to be written to the disk after
	      each write.  The default is for neither of these flags to be
	      enabled.	Enabling these flags during normal operation may
	      degrade performance and/or lengthen startup time.

       1mOption "NoPM"	"4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disables something to do with power management events.  Default:
	      PM enabled on platforms that support it.

       1mOption "Xinerama"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      enable or disable XINERAMA extension. Default is disabled.

       1mOption "AllowDeactivateGrabs" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This option enables the use of the 1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Divide 22mkey
	      sequence to deactivate any active keyboard and mouse grabs.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "AllowClosedownGrabs" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This option enables the use of the 1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply 22mkey
	      sequence to kill clients with an active keyboard or mouse grab
	      as well as killing any application that may have locked the
	      server, normally using the XGrabServer(3) Xlib function.
	      Default: off.
	      Note that the options 1mAllowDeactivateGrabs 22mand 1mAllowClosedown-0m
	      1mGrabs 22mwill allow users to remove the grab used by screen
	      saver/locker programs.  An API was written to such cases. If you
	      enable this option, make sure your screen saver/locker is
	      updated.

       1mOption "HandleSpecialKeys" "4m22mwhen24m1m"0m
	      This option controls when the server uses the builtin handler to
	      process special key combinations (such as 1mCtrl+Alt+Backspace22m).
	      Normally the XKEYBOARD extension keymaps will provide mappings
	      for each of the special key combinations, so the builtin handler
	      is not needed unless the XKEYBOARD extension is disabled.	 The
	      value of 4mwhen24m can be 1mAlways22m, 1mNever22m, or 1mWhenNeeded22m.  Default: Use
	      the builtin handler only if needed.  The server will scan the
	      keymap for a mapping to the 1mTerminate 22maction and, if found, use
	      XKEYBOARD for processing actions, otherwise the builtin handler
	      will be used.

1mMODULE SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mModule 22msection.  They are used to
       specify additional XFree86 server modules to be loaded.	This section
       is ignored when the XFree86 server is built in static form.  The types
       of modules normally loaded in this section are XFree86 server extension
       modules, and font rasteriser modules.  Most other module types are
       loaded automatically when they are needed via other mechanisms.	The
       1mModule 22msection is optional, as are all of the entries that may be spec-
       ified in it.


       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	      specifies an optional identifying name for the 1mModule 22msection.

       1mOptions0m
	      Option flags may be specified in 1mModule 22msections.

       Entries that identify which modules to pre-load may be in two forms.
       The first and most commonly used form is an entry that uses the 1mLoad0m
       keyword, as described here:

       1mLoad  "4m22mmodulename24m1m"0m
	      This instructs the server to load the module called 4mmodulename24m.
	      The module name given should be the module's standard name, not
	      the module file name.  The standard name is case-sensitive, and
	      does not include the "lib" prefix, or the ".a", ".o", or ".so"
	      suffixes.

	      Example: the Type 1 font rasteriser can be loaded with the fol-
	      lowing entry:

		  1mLoad "type1"0m

       The second form of entry is a 1mSubSection, 22mwith the subsection name
       being the module name, and the contents of the 1mSubSection 22mbeing 1mOptions0m
       that are passed to the module when it is loaded.

       Example: the extmod module (which contains a miscellaneous group of
       server extensions) can be loaded, with the XFree86-DGA extension dis-
       abled by using the following entry:

	   1mSubSection "extmod"0m
	      1mOption	"omit XFree86-DGA"0m
	   1mEndSubSection0m

       Modules are searched for in each directory specified in the 1mModulePath0m
       search path, and in the drivers, input, extensions, fonts, and internal
       subdirectories of each of those directories.  In addition to this,
       operating system specific subdirectories of all the above are searched
       first if they exist.

       To see what font and extension modules are available, check the con-
       tents of the following directories:

	   /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/fonts
	   /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions

       The "bitmap" font modules is loaded automatically.  It is recommended
       that at very least the "extmod" extension module be loaded.  If it
       isn't some commonly used server extensions (like the SHAPE extension)
       will not be available.

1mINPUTDEVICE SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mInputDevice 22msections.  There will
       normally be at least two: one for the core (primary) keyboard, and one
       of the core pointer.  If either of these two is missing, a default con-
       figuration for the missing ones will be used.  Currently the default
       configuration may not work as expected on all platforms.

       1mInputDevice 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "InputDevice"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       1mDriver	    "4m22minputdriver24m1m"0m
	       4moptions0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The 1mIdentifier 22mand 1mDriver 22mentries are required in all 1mInputDevice 22msec-
       tions.  All other entries are optional.

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this input device.
       The 1mDriver 22mentry specifies the name of the driver to use for this input
       device.	When using the loadable server, the input driver module
       "4minputdriver24m" will be loaded for each active 1mInputDevice 22msection.  An
       1mInputDevice 22msection is considered active if it is referenced by an
       active 1mServerLayout 22msection, if it is referenced by the 1m-keyboard 22mor
       1m-pointer 22mcommand line options, or if it is selected implicitly as the
       core pointer or keyboard device in the absence of such explicit refer-
       ences.  The most commonly used input drivers are "keyboard" and
       "mouse".

       In the absence of an explicitly specified core input device, the first
       1mInputDevice 22mmarked as 1mCorePointer 22m(or 1mCoreKeyboard22m) is used.  If there
       is no match there, the first 1mInputDevice 22mthat uses the "mouse" (or
       "keyboard" or "kbd") driver is used.  The final fallback is to use
       built-in default configurations.

       1mInputDevice 22msections recognise some driver-independent 1mOptions22m, which
       are described here.  See the individual input driver manual pages for a
       description of the device-specific options.

       1mOption "CorePointer"0m
	      When this is set, the input device is installed as the core
	      (primary) pointer device.	 There must be exactly one core
	      pointer.	If this option is not set here, or in the 1mServerLayout0m
	      section, or from the 1m-pointer 22mcommand line option, then the
	      first input device that is capable of being used as a core
	      pointer will be selected as the core pointer.  This option is
	      implicitly set when the obsolete 1mPointer 22msection is used.

       1mOption "CoreKeyboard"0m
	      When this is set, the input device is to be installed as the
	      core (primary) keyboard device.  There must be exactly one core
	      keyboard.	 If this option is not set here, in the 1mServerLayout0m
	      section, or from the 1m-keyboard 22mcommand line option, then the
	      first input device that is capable of being used as a core key-
	      board will be selected as the core keyboard.  This option is
	      implicitly set when the obsolete 1mKeyboard 22msection is used.

       1mOption "AlwaysCore"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m

       1mOption "SendCoreEvents"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Both of these options are equivalent, and when enabled cause the
	      input device to always report core events.  This can be used,
	      for example, to allow an additional pointer device to generate
	      core pointer events (like moving the cursor, etc).

       1mOption "HistorySize"  "4m22mnumber24m1m"0m
	   Sets the motion history size.  Default: 0.

       1mOption "SendDragEvents"  "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      ???

1mDEVICE SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mDevice 22msections.	There must be at
       least one, for the video card being used.

       1mDevice 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "Device"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       1mDriver	    "4m22mdriver24m1m"0m
	       4mentries0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The 1mIdentifier 22mand 1mDriver 22mentries are required in all 1mDevice 22msections.
       All other entries are optional.

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this graphics
       device.	The 1mDriver 22mentry specifies the name of the driver to use for
       this graphics device.  When using the loadable server, the driver mod-
       ule "4mdriver24m" will be loaded for each active 1mDevice 22msection.  A 1mDevice0m
       section is considered active if it is referenced by an active 1mScreen0m
       section.

       1mDevice 22msections recognise some driver-independent entries and 1mOptions22m,
       which are described here.  Not all drivers make use of these driver-
       independent entries, and many of those that do don't require them to be
       specified because the information is auto-detected.  See the individual
       graphics driver manual pages for further information about this, and
       for a description of the device-specific options.  Note that most of
       the 1mOptions 22mlisted here (but not the other entries) may be specified in
       the 1mScreen 22msection instead of here in the 1mDevice 22msection.

       1mBusID	"4m22mbus-id24m1m"0m
	      This specifies the bus location of the graphics card.  For
	      PCI/AGP cards, the 4mbus-id24m string has the form
	      1mPCI:4m22mbus24m1m:4m22mdevice24m1m:4m22mfunction24m (e.g., "PCI:1:0:0" might be appropriate
	      for an AGP card).	 This field is usually optional in single-head
	      configurations when using the primary graphics card.  In multi-
	      head configurations, or when using a secondary graphics card in
	      a single-head configuration, this entry is mandatory.  Its main
	      purpose is to make an unambiguous connection between the device
	      section and the hardware it is representing.  This information
	      can usually be found by running the XFree86 server with the
	      1m-scanpci 22mcommand line option.

       1mScreen	 4m22mnumber0m
	      This option is mandatory for cards where a single PCI entity can
	      drive more than one display (i.e., multiple CRTCs sharing a sin-
	      gle graphics accelerator and video memory).  One 1mDevice 22msection
	      is required for each head, and this parameter determines which
	      head each of the 1mDevice 22msections applies to.	 The legal values
	      of 4mnumber24m range from 0 to one less than the total number of
	      heads per entity.	 Most drivers require that the primary screen
	      (0) be present.

       1mChipset  "4m22mchipset24m1m"0m
	      This usually optional entry specifies the chipset used on the
	      graphics board.  In most cases this entry is not required
	      because the drivers will probe the hardware to determine the
	      chipset type.  Don't specify it unless the driver-specific docu-
	      mentation recommends that you do.

       1mRamdac	 "4m22mramdac-type24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry specifies the type of RAMDAC used on the
	      graphics board.  This is only used by a few of the drivers, and
	      in most cases it is not required because the drivers will probe
	      the hardware to determine the RAMDAC type where possible.	 Don't
	      specify it unless the driver-specific documentation recommends
	      that you do.

       1mDacSpeed  4m22mspeed0m

       1mDacSpeed  4m22mspeed-824m 4mspeed-1624m 4mspeed-2424m 4mspeed-320m
	      This optional entry specifies the RAMDAC speed rating (which is
	      usually printed on the RAMDAC chip).  The speed is in MHz.  When
	      one value is given, it applies to all framebuffer pixel sizes.
	      When multiple values are give, they apply to the framebuffer
	      pixel sizes 8, 16, 24 and 32 respectively.  This is not used by
	      many drivers, and only needs to be specified when the speed rat-
	      ing of the RAMDAC is different from the defaults built in to
	      driver, or when the driver can't auto-detect the correct
	      defaults.	 Don't specify it unless the driver-specific documen-
	      tation recommends that you do.

       1mClocks	 4m22mclock24m 4m...0m
	      specifies the pixel that are on your graphics board.  The clocks
	      are in MHz, and may be specified as a floating point number.
	      The value is stored internally to the nearest kHz.  The ordering
	      of the clocks is important.  It must match the order in which
	      they are selected on the graphics board.	Multiple 1mClocks 22mlines
	      may be specified, and each is concatenated to form the list.
	      Most drivers do not use this entry, and it is only required for
	      some older boards with non-programmable clocks.  Don't specify
	      this entry unless the driver-specific documentation explicitly
	      recommends that you do.

       1mClockChip  "4m22mclockchip-type24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry is used to specify the clock chip type on
	      graphics boards which have a programmable clock generator.  Only
	      a few XFree86 drivers support programmable clock chips.  For
	      details, see the appropriate driver manual page.

       1mVideoRam  4m22mmem0m
	      This optional entry specifies the amount of video ram that is
	      installed on the graphics board. This is measured in kBytes.  In
	      most cases this is not required because the XFree86 server
	      probes the graphics board to determine this quantity.  The
	      driver-specific documentation should indicate when it might be
	      needed.

       1mBiosBase  4m22mbaseaddress0m
	      This optional entry specifies the base address of the video BIOS
	      for the VGA board.  This address is normally auto-detected, and
	      should only be specified if the driver-specific documentation
	      recommends it.

       1mMemBase  4m22mbaseaddress0m
	      This optional entry specifies the memory base address of a
	      graphics board's linear frame buffer.  This entry is not used by
	      many drivers, and it should only be specified if the driver-spe-
	      cific documentation recommends it.

       1mIOBase	 4m22mbaseaddress0m
	      This optional entry specifies the IO base address.  This entry
	      is not used by many drivers, and it should only be specified if
	      the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       1mChipID	 4m22mid0m
	      This optional entry specifies a numerical ID representing the
	      chip type.  For PCI cards, it is usually the device ID.  This
	      can be used to override the auto-detection, but that should only
	      be done when the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       1mChipRev  4m22mrev0m
	      This optional entry specifies the chip revision number.  This
	      can be used to override the auto-detection, but that should only
	      be done when the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       1mTextClockFreq	4m22mfreq0m
	      This optional entry specifies the pixel clock frequency that is
	      used for the regular text mode.  The frequency is specified in
	      MHz.  This is rarely used.

       1mIRQ 4m22minterrupt-number0m
	      This optional entry allows an interrupt number to be specified.

       1mOptions0m
	      Option flags may be specified in the 1mDevice 22msections.  These
	      include driver-specific options and driver-independent options.
	      The former are described in the driver-specific documentation.
	      Some of the latter are described below in the section about the
	      1mScreen 22msection, and they may also be included here.


1mVIDEOADAPTOR SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mVideoAdaptor 22msections, which may be
       referenced from 1mScreen 22msections.

       1mVideoAdaptor 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "VideoAdaptor"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       4mentries0m
	       4m...0m
	       1mSubSection "Port"0m
		  4mentries0m
		  4m...0m
	       1mEndSubSection0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The only mandatory entry in a 1mVideoAdaptor 22msection is the 1mIdentifier22m.
       Other entries include:

       1mVendorName  "4m22mvendor24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry specifies the video adaptor's manufacturer.

       1mBoardName  "4m22mmodel24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry specifies the video adaptor's model name.

       1mOptions0m
	      may be specified in the 1mVideoAdaptor 22msection.

       The 1mPort SubSections 22mprovide information about video adaptor ports.
       Each of these may contain an 1mIdentifier 22mentry and 1mOptions22m.

1mMONITOR SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mMonitor 22msections.	 There should nor-
       mally be at least one, for the monitor being used, but a default con-
       figuration will be created when one isn't specified.

       1mMonitor 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "Monitor"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       4mentries0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The only mandatory entry in a 1mMonitor 22msection is the 1mIdentifier 22mentry.

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this monitor.  The
       1mMonitor 22msection provides information about the specifications of the
       monitor, monitor-specific 1mOptions22m, and information about the video
       modes to use with the monitor.  Specifying video modes is optional
       because the server now has a built-in list of VESA standard modes.
       When modes are specified explicitly in the 1mMonitor 22msection (with the
       1mModes22m, 1mModeLine22m, or 1mUseModes 22mkeywords), built-in modes with the same
       names are not included.	Built-in modes with different names are, how-
       ever, still implicitly included.

       The entries that may be used in 1mMonitor 22msections are described below.

       1mVendorName  "4m22mvendor24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry specifies the monitor's manufacturer.

       1mModelName  "4m22mmodel24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry specifies the monitor's model.

       1mHorizSync  4m22mhorizsync-range0m
	      gives the range(s) of horizontal sync frequencies supported by
	      the monitor.  4mhorizsync-range24m may be a comma separated list of
	      either discrete values or ranges of values.  A range of values
	      is two values separated by a dash.  By default the values are in
	      units of kHz.  They may be specified in MHz or Hz if 1mMHz 22mor 1mHz0m
	      is added to the end of the line.	The data given here is used by
	      the XFree86 server to determine if video modes are within the
	      specifications of the monitor.  This information should be
	      available in the monitor's handbook.  If this entry is omitted,
	      a default range of 28-33kHz is used.

       1mVertRefresh  4m22mvertrefresh-range0m
	      gives the range(s) of vertical refresh frequencies supported by
	      the monitor.  4mvertrefresh-range24m may be a comma separated list of
	      either discrete values or ranges of values.  A range of values
	      is two values separated by a dash.  By default the values are in
	      units of Hz.  They may be specified in MHz or kHz if 1mMHz 22mor 1mkHz0m
	      is added to the end of the line.	The data given here is used by
	      the XFree86 server to determine if video modes are within the
	      specifications of the monitor.  This information should be
	      available in the monitor's handbook.  If this entry is omitted,
	      a default range of 43-72Hz is used.

       1mDisplaySize  4m22mwidth24m 4mheight0m
	      This optional entry gives the width and height, in millimetres,
	      of the picture area of the monitor. If given this is used to
	      calculate the horizontal and vertical pitch (DPI) of the screen.

       1mGamma	4m22mgamma-value0m

       1mGamma	4m22mred-gamma24m 4mgreen-gamma24m 4mblue-gamma0m
	      This is an optional entry that can be used to specify the gamma
	      correction for the monitor.  It may be specified as either a
	      single value or as three separate RGB values.  The values should
	      be in the range 0.1 to 10.0, and the default is 1.0.  Not all
	      drivers are capable of using this information.

       1mUseModes  "4m22mmodesection-id24m1m"0m
	      Include the set of modes listed in the 1mModes 22msection called 4mmod-0m
	      4mesection-id.24m	 This make all of the modes defined in that section
	      available for use by this monitor.

       1mMode  "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	      This is an optional multi-line entry that can be used to provide
	      definitions for video modes for the monitor.  In most cases this
	      isn't necessary because the built-in set of VESA standard modes
	      will be sufficient.  The 1mMode 22mkeyword indicates the start of a
	      multi-line video mode description.  The mode description is ter-
	      minated with the 1mEndMode 22mkeyword.  The mode description consists
	      of the following entries:

	      1mDotClock  4m22mclock0m
		  is the dot (pixel) clock rate to be used for the mode.

	      1mHTimings  4m22mhdisp24m 4mhsyncstart24m 4mhsyncend24m 4mhtotal0m
		  specifies the horizontal timings for the mode.

	      1mVTimings  4m22mvdisp24m 4mvsyncstart24m 4mvsyncend24m 4mvtotal0m
		  specifies the vertical timings for the mode.

	      1mFlags  "4m22mflag24m1m" 4m22m...0m
		  specifies an optional set of mode flags, each of which is a
		  separate string in double quotes.  1m"Interlace" 22mindicates
		  that the mode is interlaced.	1m"DoubleScan" 22mindicates a mode
		  where each scanline is doubled.  1m"+HSync" 22mand 1m"-HSync" 22mcan
		  be used to select the polarity of the HSync signal.
		  1m"+VSync" 22mand 1m"-VSync" 22mcan be used to select the polarity of
		  the VSync signal.  1m"Composite" 22mcan be used to specify com-
		  posite sync on hardware where this is supported.  Addition-
		  ally, on some hardware, 1m"+CSync" 22mand 1m"-CSync" 22mmay be used to
		  select the composite sync polarity.

	      1mHSkew  4m22mhskew0m
		  specifies the number of pixels (towards the right edge of
		  the screen) by which the display enable signal is to be
		  skewed.  Not all drivers use this information.  This option
		  might become necessary to override the default value sup-
		  plied by the server (if any).	 "Roving" horizontal lines
		  indicate this value needs to be increased.  If the last few
		  pixels on a scan line appear on the left of the screen, this
		  value should be decreased.

	      1mVScan  4m22mvscan0m
		  specifies the number of times each scanline is painted on
		  the screen.  Not all drivers use this information.  Values
		  less than 1 are treated as 1, which is the default.  Gener-
		  ally, the 1m"DoubleScan" Flag 22mmentioned above doubles this
		  value.

       1mModeLine  "4m22mname24m1m" 4m22mmode-description0m
	      This entry is a more compact version of the 1mMode 22mentry, and it
	      also can be used to specify video modes for the monitor.	is a
	      single line format for specifying video modes.  In most cases
	      this isn't necessary because the built-in set of VESA standard
	      modes will be sufficient.

	      The 4mmode-description24m is in four sections, the first three of
	      which are mandatory.  The first is the dot (pixel) clock.	 This
	      is a single number specifying the pixel clock rate for the mode
	      in MHz.  The second section is a list of four numbers specifying
	      the horizontal timings.  These numbers are the 4mhdisp24m, 4mhsync-0m
	      4mstart24m, 4mhsyncend24m, and 4mhtotal24m values.  The third section is a list
	      of four numbers specifying the vertical timings.	These numbers
	      are the 4mvdisp24m, 4mvsyncstart24m, 4mvsyncend24m, and 4mvtotal24m values.  The
	      final section is a list of flags specifying other characteris-
	      tics of the mode.	 1mInterlace 22mindicates that the mode is inter-
	      laced.  1mDoubleScan 22mindicates a mode where each scanline is dou-
	      bled.  1m+HSync 22mand 1m-HSync 22mcan be used to select the polarity of
	      the HSync signal.	 1m+VSync 22mand 1m-VSync 22mcan be used to select the
	      polarity of the VSync signal.  1mComposite 22mcan be used to specify
	      composite sync on hardware where this is supported.  Addition-
	      ally, on some hardware, 1m+CSync 22mand 1m-CSync 22mmay be used to select
	      the composite sync polarity.  The 1mHSkew 22mand 1mVScan 22moptions men-
	      tioned above in the 1mModes 22mentry description can also be used
	      here.

       1mOption "DPMS" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Set whether DPMS is enabled for the monitor.  The default is
	      taken from the monitor's DDC/EDID information if available, or
	      false if not.

       1mOption "TargetRefresh" "4m22mrefresh24m1m"0m
	      Sets a target refresh rate to use for the monitor.  If the moni-
	      tor has valid modes with a refresh rate greater or equal to this
	      value, those with a lower refresh rate will not be considered
	      when determining the default resolution to use.  This is
	      improves the default resolution selection when none is specified
	      explicitly.  Default: 1mTargetRefresh 22mnot used.

       1mOption "SyncOnGreen" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Set whether sync-on-green should be enabled.  The availability
	      of this option is driver-specific.  Default: false.

       1mOption "PreferredMode" "4m22mXres24m1mx4m22mYres24m1m"0m
	      Sets a preferred resolution to use for the default mode.	By
	      default the preferred mode resolution is taken from the DDC/EDID
	      data if it is available and if it is provides a default mode
	      preference.  This is typically true for flat panel displays,
	      which have a native/preferred resolution.	 This option is not
	      used if the 1mUsePreferredMode 22moption is false.

       1mOption "UsePreferredMode" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Controls whether or not a preferred mode, either detected from
	      the monitor's DDC/EDID data or provided explicitly with the 1mPre-0m
	      1mferredMode 22moption, is used.	Default: true.

       1mOptions0m
	      Additional 1mOption 22mflags, including driver-specific options, may
	      be included in 1mMonitor 22msections.


1mMODES SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mModes 22msections, or none.	These sec-
       tions provide a way of defining sets of video modes independently of
       the 1mMonitor 22msections.  1mMonitor 22msections may include the definitions
       provided in these sections by using the 1mUseModes 22mkeyword.  In most
       cases the 1mModes 22msections are not necessary because the built-in set of
       VESA standard modes will be sufficient.

       1mModes 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "Modes"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       4mentries0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this set of mode
       descriptions.  The other entries permitted in 1mModes 22msections are the
       1mMode 22mand 1mModeLine 22mentries that are described above in the 1mMonitor 22msec-
       tion, as well as 1mOptions22m.

1mSCREEN SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mScreen 22msections.	There must be at
       least one, for the "screen" being used.	A "screen" represents the
       binding of a graphics device (1mDevice 22msection) and one or more monitors
       (1mMonitor 22msections).	 A 1mScreen 22msection is considered "active" if it is
       referenced by an active 1mServerLayout 22msection or by the 1m-screen 22mcommand
       line option.  If neither of those is present, the first 1mScreen 22msection
       found in the config file is considered the active one.

       1mScreen 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "Screen"0m
	       1mIdentifier "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       1mDevice	    "4m22mdevid24m1m"0m
	       1mMonitor    "4m22mmonid24m1m"0m
	       4mentries0m
	       4m...0m
	       1mSubSection "Display"0m
		  4mentries0m
		  4m...0m
	       1mEndSubSection0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       The 1mIdentifier 22mand 1mDevice 22mentries are mandatory.  All others are
       optional.

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this screen.  The
       1mScreen 22msection provides information specific to the whole screen,
       including screen-specific 1mOptions22m.	In multi-head configurations, there
       will be multiple active 1mScreen 22msections, one for each head.	 The
       entries available for this section are:

       1mDevice	 "4m22mdevice-id24m1m"0m
	      This mandatory entry specifies the 1mDevice 22msection to be used for
	      this screen.  This is what ties a specific graphics card to a
	      screen.  The 4mdevice-id24m must match the 1mIdentifier 22mof a 1mDevice0m
	      section in the config file.

       1mMonitor  4m22mmonitor-num24m 1m"4m22mmonitor-id24m1m"0m
	      One of these entries may be given for each monitor associated
	      with this screen.	 In the absence of these entries, at least one
	      default monitor will be created for the screen.  The 4mmonitor-id0m
	      field is mandatory, and specifies the 1mMonitor 22msection being ref-
	      erenced.	The 4mmonitor-num24m field is required when more than one
	      monitor is being associated with the screen.  Each referenced
	      monitor should be given a unique monitor number.	This monitor
	      number may be given special significance by the driver, and it
	      is also used to identify which 1mDisplay 22msubsection(s) are associ-
	      ated with the screen/monitor.  If this field is omitted in a
	      multiple-monitor configuration, default values will be assigned.
	      This is not recommended, and this behaviour may change in future
	      revisions.

	      If a 1mMonitor 22mname is not specified, a default configuration is
	      used.  Currently the default configuration may not function as
	      expected on all platforms.

       1mVideoAdaptor  "4m22mxv-id24m1m"0m
	      specifies an optional Xv video adaptor description to be used
	      with this screen.

       1mDefaultDepth  4m22mdepth0m
	      specifies which color depth the server should use by default.
	      The 1m-depth 22mcommand line option can be used to override this.	 If
	      neither is specified, the default depth is driver-specific, but
	      in most cases is 8.

       1mDefaultFbBpp  4m22mbpp0m
	      specifies which framebuffer layout to use by default.  The
	      1m-fbbpp 22mcommand line option can be used to override this.  In
	      most cases the driver will chose the best default value for
	      this.  The only case where there is even a choice in this value
	      is for depth 24, where some hardware supports both a packed 24
	      bit framebuffer layout and a sparse 32 bit framebuffer layout.

       1mOptions0m
	      Various 1mOption 22mflags may be specified in the 1mScreen 22msection.
	      Some are driver-specific and are described in the driver docu-
	      mentation.  Others are driver-independent, and will eventually
	      be described here.

       1mOption "Accel"0m
	      Enables XAA (X Acceleration Architecture), a mechanism that
	      makes video cards' 2D hardware acceleration available to the
	      XFree86 server.  This option is on by default, but it may be
	      necessary to turn it off if there are bugs in the driver.	 There
	      are many options to disable specific accelerated operations,
	      listed below.  Note that disabling an operation will have no
	      effect if the operation is not accelerated (whether due to lack
	      of support in the hardware or in the driver).

       1mOption "BiosLocation" "4m22maddress24m1m"0m
	      Set the location of the BIOS for the Int10 module. One may
	      select a BIOS of another card for posting or the legacy V_BIOS
	      range located at 0xc0000 or an alternative address (BUS_ISA).
	      This is only useful under very special circumstances and should
	      be used with extreme care.

       1mOption "InitPrimary" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Use the Int10 module to initialize the primary graphics card.
	      Normally, only secondary cards are soft-booted using the Int10
	      module, as the primary card has already been initialized by the
	      BIOS at boot time.  Default: false.

       1mOption "NoInt10" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disables the Int10 module, a module that uses the int10 call to
	      the BIOS of the graphics card to initialize it. Default: false.

       1mOption "NoMTRR"0m
	      Disables MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support, a feature of
	      modern processors which can improve video performance by a fac-
	      tor of up to 2.5.	 Some hardware has buggy MTRR support, and
	      some video drivers have been known to exhibit problems when
	      MTRR's are used.

       1mOption "XaaNoCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"0m
	      Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source
	      patterns stored in system memory (using a memory-mapped aper-
	      ture).

       1mOption "XaaNoColor8x8PatternFillRect"0m
	      Disables accelerated fills of a rectangular region with a full-
	      color pattern.

       1mOption "XaaNoColor8x8PatternFillTrap"0m
	      Disables accelerated fills of a trapezoidal region with a full-
	      color pattern.

       1mOption "XaaNoDashedBresenhamLine"0m
	      Disables accelerated dashed Bresenham line draws.

       1mOption "XaaNoDashedTwoPointLine"0m
	      Disables accelerated dashed line draws between two arbitrary
	      points.

       1mOption "XaaNoImageWriteRect"0m
	      Disables accelerated transfers of full-color rectangular pat-
	      terns from system memory to video memory (using a memory-mapped
	      aperture).

       1mOption "XaaNoMono8x8PatternFillRect"0m
	      Disables accelerated fills of a rectangular region with a mono-
	      chrome pattern.

       1mOption "XaaNoMono8x8PatternFillTrap"0m
	      Disables accelerated fills of a trapezoidal region with a mono-
	      chrome pattern.

       1mOption "XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps"0m
	      Disables accelerated draws into pixmaps stored in offscreen
	      video memory.

       1mOption "XaaNoPixmapCache"0m
	      Disables caching of patterns in offscreen video memory.

       1mOption "XaaNoScanlineCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"0m
	      Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source
	      patterns stored in system memory (one scan line at a time).

       1mOption "XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect"0m
	      Disables accelerated transfers of full-color rectangular pat-
	      terns from system memory to video memory (one scan line at a
	      time).

       1mOption "XaaNoScreenToScreenColorExpandFill"0m
	      Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source
	      patterns stored in offscreen video memory.

       1mOption "XaaNoScreenToScreenCopy"0m
	      Disables accelerated copies of rectangular regions from one part
	      of video memory to another part of video memory.

       1mOption "XaaNoSolidBresenhamLine"0m
	      Disables accelerated solid Bresenham line draws.

       1mOption "XaaNoSolidFillRect"0m
	      Disables accelerated solid-color fills of rectangles.

       1mOption "XaaNoSolidFillTrap"0m
	      Disables accelerated solid-color fills of Bresenham trapezoids.

       1mOption "XaaNoSolidHorVertLine"0m
	      Disables accelerated solid horizontal and vertical line draws.

       1mOption "XaaNoSolidTwoPointLine"0m
	      Disables accelerated solid line draws between two arbitrary
	      points.

       Each 1mScreen 22msection may optionally contain one or more 1mDisplay 22msubsec-
       tions.  Those subsections provide depth, fbbpp and monitor specific
       configuration information, and the ones chosen depend on the depth
       and/or fbbpp that is being used for the screen, as well as the monitor
       number(s) in multi-monitor configurations.  The 1mDisplay 22msubsection for-
       mat is described in the section below.


1mDISPLAY SUBSECTION0m
       Each 1mScreen 22msection may have multiple 1mDisplay 22msubsections.  The
       "active" 1mDisplay 22msubsections are the first for each monitor number that
       match the depth and/or fbbpp values being used, or failing that, the
       first for each monitor number that has neither a depth or fbbpp value
       specified.  Display subsections with no monitor number specified are
       used for single monitor per screen configurations.  The 1mDisplay 22msubsec-
       tions are optional.  When there isn't one that matches the monitor num-
       ber and/or depth and/or fbbpp values being used, all the parameters
       that can be specified here fall back to their defaults.

       1mDisplay 22msubsections have the following format:

	       1mSubSection "Display"0m
		   1mMonitor  4m22mmonitor-num0m
		   1mDepth  4m22mdepth0m
		   4mentries0m
		   4m...0m
	       1mEndSubSection0m

       None of the entries in a 1mDisplay 22msubsection are mandatory.

       1mMonitor  4m22mmonitor-num0m
	      This entry specifies which 1mMonitor 22mentry of the 1mScreen 22msection
	      that this 1mDisplay 22msubsection applies to.  This number should
	      match the monitor number of one of the 1mMonitor 22mreferences in the
	      1mScreen 22mscreen.  If it doesn't match, then this 1mDisplay 22msubsec-
	      tion will be ignored.  If this entry is omitted, it is applied
	      to single-monitor configurations.	 For multi-monitor configura-
	      tions, the driver may also use information in this subsection
	      for screen-wide parameters.  Not all of the parameters in this
	      subsection make sense on a per-monitor basis.  Which get used
	      and how they get used is currently up to the driver.  Entries
	      that are relevant to multi-monitor configurations include 1mModes22m,
	      1mVirtual22m, 1mViewPort22m, and 1mOptions22m.

       1mDepth	4m22mdepth0m
	      This entry specifies what colour depth the 1mDisplay 22msubsection is
	      to be used for.  This entry is usually specified, but it may be
	      omitted to create a match-all 1mDisplay 22msubsection or when wishing
	      to match only against the 1mFbBpp 22mparameter.  The range of 4mdepth0m
	      values that are allowed depends on the driver.  Most driver sup-
	      port 8, 15, 16 and 24.  Some also support 1 and/or 4, and some
	      may support other values (like 30).  Note: 4mdepth24m means the num-
	      ber of bits in a pixel that are actually used to determine the
	      pixel colour.  32 is not a valid 4mdepth24m value.  Most hardware
	      that uses 32 bits per pixel only uses 24 of them to hold the
	      colour information, which means that the colour depth is 24, not
	      32.

       1mFbBpp	4m22mbpp0m
	      This entry specifies the framebuffer format this 1mDisplay 22msubsec-
	      tion is to be used for.  This entry is only needed when provid-
	      ing depth 24 configurations that allow a choice between a 24 bpp
	      packed framebuffer format and a 32bpp sparse framebuffer format.
	      In most cases this entry should not be used.

       1mWeight	 4m22mred-weight24m 4mgreen-weight24m 4mblue-weight0m
	      This optional entry specifies the relative RGB weighting to be
	      used for a screen is being used at depth 16 for drivers that
	      allow multiple formats.  This may also be specified from the
	      command line with the 1m-weight 22moption (see XFree86(1)).

       1mVirtual  4m22mxdim24m 4mydim0m
	      This optional entry specifies the virtual screen resolution to
	      be used.	4mxdim24m must be a multiple of either 8 or 16 for most
	      drivers, and a multiple of 32 when running in monochrome mode.
	      The given value will be rounded down if this is not the case.
	      Video modes which are too large for the specified virtual size
	      will be rejected.	 If this entry is not present, the virtual
	      screen resolution will be set to accommodate all the valid video
	      modes given in the 1mModes 22mentry.  Some drivers/hardware combina-
	      tions do not support virtual screens.  Refer to the appropriate
	      driver-specific documentation for details.

       1mViewPort  4m22mx024m 4my00m
	      This optional entry sets the upper left corner of the initial
	      display.	This is only relevant when the virtual screen resolu-
	      tion is different from the resolution of the initial video mode.
	      If this entry is not given, then the initial display will be
	      centered in the virtual display area.

       1mModes	"4m22mmode-name24m1m" 4m22m...0m
	      This optional entry specifies the list of video modes to use.
	      Each 4mmode-name24m specified must be in double quotes.  They must
	      correspond to those specified or referenced in the appropriate
	      1mMonitor 22msection (including implicitly referenced built-in VESA
	      standard modes).	The server will delete modes from this list
	      which don't satisfy various requirements.	 The first valid mode
	      in this list will be the default display mode for startup.  The
	      list of valid modes is converted internally into a circular
	      list.  It is possible to switch to the next mode with
	      1mCtrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus 22mand to the previous mode with 1mCtrl+Alt+Key-0m
	      1mpad-Minus22m.  When this entry is omitted, the valid modes refer-
	      enced by the appropriate 1mMonitor 22msection will be used.  If the
	      1mMonitor 22msection contains no modes, then the selection will be
	      taken from the built-in VESA standard modes.

       1mVisual	 "4m22mvisual-name24m1m"0m
	      This optional entry sets the default root visual type.  This may
	      also be specified from the command line (see the Xserver(1) man
	      page).  The visual types available for depth 8 are (default is
	      1mPseudoColor22m):

		  1mStaticGray0m
		  1mGrayScale0m
		  1mStaticColor0m
		  1mPseudoColor0m
		  1mTrueColor0m
		  1mDirectColor0m

	      The visual type available for the depths 15, 16 and 24 are
	      (default is 1mTrueColor22m):

		  1mTrueColor0m
		  1mDirectColor0m

	      Not all drivers support 1mDirectColor 22mat these depths.

	      The visual types available for the depth 4 are (default is 1mStat-0m
	      1micColor22m):

		  1mStaticGray0m
		  1mGrayScale0m
		  1mStaticColor0m
		  1mPseudoColor0m

	      The visual type available for the depth 1 (monochrome) is 1mStat-0m
	      1micGray22m.

       1mBlack	4m22mred24m 4mgreen24m 4mblue0m
	      This optional entry allows the "black" colour to be specified.
	      This is only supported at depth 1.  The default is black.

       1mWhite	4m22mred24m 4mgreen24m 4mblue0m
	      This optional entry allows the "white" colour to be specified.
	      This is only supported at depth 1.  The default is white.

       1mOptions0m
	      Option flags may be specified in the 1mDisplay 22msubsections.  These
	      may include driver-specific options and driver-independent
	      options.	The former are described in the driver-specific docu-
	      mentation.  Some of the latter are described above in the sec-
	      tion about the 1mScreen 22msection, and they may also be included
	      here.

1mSERVERLAYOUT SECTION0m
       The config file may have multiple 1mServerLayout 22msections.  A "server
       layout" represents the binding of one or more screens (1mScreen 22msections)
       and one or more input devices (1mInputDevice 22msections) to form a complete
       configuration.  In multi-head configurations, it also specifies the
       relative layout of the heads.  A 1mServerLayout 22msection is considered
       "active" if it is referenced by the 1m-layout 22mcommand line option or by
       an 1mOption "DefaultServerLayout" 22mentry in the 1mServerFlags 22msection (the
       former takes precedence over the latter).  If those options are not
       used, the first 1mServerLayout 22msection found in the config file is con-
       sidered the active one.	If no 1mServerLayout 22msections are present, the
       single active screen and two active (core) input devices are selected
       as described in the relevant sections above.

       1mServerLayout 22msections have the following format:

	   1mSection "ServerLayout"0m
	       1mIdentifier   "4m22mname24m1m"0m
	       1mScreen	      "4m22mscreen-id24m1m"0m
	       4m...0m
	       1mInputDevice  "4m22midev-id24m1m"0m
	       4m...0m
	       4moptions0m
	       4m...0m
	   1mEndSection0m

       Each 1mServerLayout 22msection must have an 1mIdentifier 22mentry and at least
       one 1mScreen 22mentry.

       The 1mIdentifier 22mentry specifies the unique name for this server layout.
       The 1mServerLayout 22msection provides information specific to the whole
       session, including session-specific 1mOptions22m.  The 1mServerFlags 22moptions
       (described above) may be specified here, and ones given here override
       those given in the 1mServerFlags 22msection.

       The entries that may be used in this section are described here.

       1mScreen	 4m22mscreen-num24m 1m"4m22mscreen-id24m1m" 4m22mposition-information0m
	      One of these entries must be given for each screen being used in
	      a session.  The 4mscreen-id24m field is mandatory, and specifies the
	      1mScreen 22msection being referenced.  The 4mscreen-num24m field is
	      optional, and may be used to specify the screen number in multi-
	      head configurations.  When this field is omitted, the screens
	      will be numbered in the order that they are listed in.  The num-
	      bering starts from 0, and must be consecutive.  The optional
	      4mposition-information24m field describes the way multiple screens
	      are positioned.  When this information is not provided, the
	      positioning of the screen defaults to 1mAbsolute 4m22m024m 4m024m.  There are a
	      number of different ways that this information can be provided:

	      4mx24m 4my0m

	      1mAbsolute  4m22mx24m 4my0m
		  These both specify that the upper left corner's coordinates
		  are (4mx24m,4my24m).	The 1mAbsolute 22mkeyword is optional.	Some older
		  versions of XFree86 (4.2 and earlier) don't recognise the
		  1mAbsolute 22mkeyword, so it's safest to just specify the coordi-
		  nates without it.

	      1mRightOf	  "4m22mscreen-id24m1m"0m

	      1mLeftOf	  "4m22mscreen-id24m1m"0m

	      1mAbove	  "4m22mscreen-id24m1m"0m

	      1mBelow	  "4m22mscreen-id24m1m"0m

	      1mRelative  "4m22mscreen-id24m1m" 4m22mx24m 4my0m
		  These give the screen's location relative to another screen.
		  The first four position the screen immediately to the right,
		  left, above or below the other screen.  When positioning to
		  the right or left, the top edges are aligned.	 When posi-
		  tioning above or below, the left edges are aligned.  The
		  1mRelative 22mform specifies the offset of the screen's origin
		  (upper left corner) relative to the origin of another
		  screen.

       1mInputDevice  "4m22midev-id24m1m" "4m22moption24m1m" 4m22m...0m
	      One of these entries should be given for each input device being
	      used in a session.  Normally at least two are required, one each
	      for the core pointer and keyboard devices.  If either of those
	      is missing, suitable 1mInputDevice 22mentries are searched for using
	      the method described above in the 1mINPUTDEVICE 22msection.  The
	      4midev-id24m field is mandatory, and specifies the name of the 1mInput-0m
	      1mDevice 22msection being referenced.  Multiple 4moption24m fields may be
	      specified, each in double quotes.	 The options permitted here
	      are any that may also be given in the 1mInputDevice 22msections.
	      Normally only session-specific input device options would be
	      used here.  The most commonly used options are:

		  1m"CorePointer"0m
		  1m"CoreKeyboard"0m
		  1m"SendCoreEvents"0m

	      and the first two should normally be used to indicate the core
	      pointer and core keyboard devices respectively.

       1mOptions0m
	      Any option permitted in the 1mServerFlags 22msection may also be
	      specified here.  When the same option appears in both places,
	      the value given here overrides the one given in the 1mServerFlags0m
	      section.

       Here is an example of a 1mServerLayout 22msection for a dual headed configu-
       ration with two mice:

	   1mSection "ServerLayout"0m
	       1mIdentifier  "Layout 1"0m
	       1mScreen	     "MGA 1"0m
	       1mScreen	     "MGA 2" RightOf "MGA 1"0m
	       1mInputDevice "Keyboard 1" "CoreKeyboard"0m
	       1mInputDevice "Mouse 1"	  "CorePointer"0m
	       1mInputDevice "Mouse 2"	  "SendCoreEvents"0m
	       1mOption	     "BlankTime"  "5"0m
	   1mEndSection0m

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxf86config0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mxf86config24m is an interactive program for generating an XF86Config file
       for use with XFree86 X servers.

       Note that the default name used by 4mxf86config24m for the XF86Config file
       is system-dependent.  For instance, on some systems, XF86Config-4 is
       used, and on OS/2, XConfig is used.

1mNAME0m
       xf86cfg - Graphical configuration tool for XFree86 4.0

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxf86cfg 22m[-xf86config 4mXF86Config24m] [-modulepath 4mmoduledir24m] [-fontpath
       4mfontsdir24m] [-toolkitoption ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXf86cfg24m is a tool to configure 4mXFree8624m 4m4.024m, and can be used to either
       write the initial configuration file or make customizations to the cur-
       rent configuration.

       When the 1mDISPLAY 22menvironment variable is not set, xf86cfg will run the
       command 4mXFree8624m 4m-configure24m to allow the xserver detect the hardware in
       the computer, and write an initial 4mXF86Config24m file in the user's home
       directory. Then, it will start XFree86 and allow customizations.
       If the 1mDISPLAY 22menvironment variable is set, xf86cfg will read the
       default 4mXF86Config24m, that may not be the same being used by the current
       server, and allow customizations.

       To use an alternative location for modules or fonts the respective
       search paths may be specified.

       Unless there is an 1mApply 22mbutton in the current xf86cfg dialog, the
       changes made will take place the next time 4mXFree8624m is started.


       Xf86cfg allows addition and configuration of new devices, such as video
       cards, monitors, keyboards and mouses.

       Screen layout configuration for xinerama or traditional multi-head is
       also available.

       Modelines can be configured or optimized.

       AccessX basic configurations can be made in the xf86cfg's accessx sec-
       tion.


1mOPTIONS0m
       4m-xf86config0m
	       Specifies an alternate XF86Config file for configuration.

       4m-modulepath0m
	       Specifies where xf86cfg, and the server it may start, should
	       look for XFree86 modules.

       4m-serverpath0m
	       Specifies the complete path, not including the binary name, of
	       the XFree86 binary.

       4m-fontpath0m
	       Specifies the path to the fonts that should be used by the
	       server started by xf86cfg.

       4m-rgbpath0m
	       Specifies the path to the rgb.txt file that should be used by
	       the server started by xf86cfg, if any.

       4m-textmode0m
	       If xf86cfg was compiled with support to ncurses, this option
	       makes xf86cfg enters a text mode interface.

       4m-nomodules0m
	       When built with support for loading modules, this options
	       changes xf86cfg behaviour, so that it will not load any mod-
	       ules, and thus start quicker.

getconfig(1)							  getconfig(1)



1mNAME0m
       getconfig - get configuration information for the XFree86 server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mgetconfig 22m[4moption24m 4m...24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mgetconfig 22mis a programmatic interface that is used by the 1mXFree860m
       server to get configuration information about video hardware when oper-
       ating without an 1mXF86Config 22mfile.

       This implementation of 1mgetconfig 22mis written in perl.  It processes a
       prioritized and ordered list of rules supplied internally and from
       meta-configuration files.  The rules are in the form of perl expres-
       sions.  1mgetconfig 22mwrites to standard output the XF86Config-style con-
       figuration data specified by the last highest priority rule that evalu-
       ates to true.  Information about the format of the meta-configuration
       files can be found in the getconfig(5) manual page.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-I 4m22msearch-path0m
	       Specify the search path to use for meta-config files.  4msearch-0m
	       4mpath24m is a comma-separated list of directories to search.  Each
	       directory in the search path is searched for files with a 4m.cfg0m
	       suffix.	Each such file is opened and checked for a valid sig-
	       nature string.  Rules are read from files with a valid signa-
	       ture string and appended to the list of rules to evaluate.  If
	       no search path is specified, only the internally supplied con-
	       figuration rules will be used.

       1m-D	 22mEnable debugging output.

       1m-V	 22mPrint out the version information and exit.

       1m-X 4m22mXFree86-version0m
	       Specify the XFree86 version in numeric (integer) form.

       1m-b 4m22msubsys-id0m
	       Specify the PCI subsystem ID of the video device.

       1m-c 4m22mclass0m
	       Specify the PCI class of the video device.

       1m-d 4m22mdevice-id0m
	       Specify the PCI device ID of the video device.

       1m-r 4m22mrevision0m
	       Specify the PCI revision of the video device.

       1m-s 4m22msubsysvendor-id0m
	       Specify the PCI subsystem vendor ID of the video device.

       1m-v 4m22mvendor-id0m
	       Specify the PCI vendor ID of the video device.

       1m-S 4m22msbus-path0m
	       Specify the SBUS path of the video device.

1mFILES0m
       4m.cfg24m files located in the search path.  The search path typically spec-
       ified by the 1mXFree86 22mserver is:

	   4m/usr/X11R6/etc/X110m
	   4m<modulepath>0m
	   4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/getconfig0m

getconfig(5)							  getconfig(5)



1mNAME0m
       getconfig - meta configuration files for getconfig(1)

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1m*.cfg0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mgetconfig 22mis a programmatic interface that is used by the 1mXFree860m
       server to get configuration information about video hardware when oper-
       ating without an 1mXF86Config 22mfile.

       This implementation of 1mgetconfig 22mis written in perl.  It processes
       rules from meta-configuration files.  All meta-configuration files have
       a 4m.cfg24m suffix.

       Lines starting with a pound-sign (#) are comments, and are ignored.
       Blank lines that consist only of white space are also treated as com-
       ments and ignored.

       The first non-comment line must be a signature string followed by the
       file format version number.  The signature string is

	   "XFree86 Project getconfig rules file.  Version: "

       The currently defined version is "1.0".	Files that do not have the
       correct signature string are ignored.

       The remaining non-comment lines define rules.  The start of a new rule
       is indicated by a line with no leading white space.  Subsequent lines
       making up a rule must be indented with white space.  Logical lines
       within a rule may be split over multiple physical lines by using the
       usual continuation convention ('\' at the end of the line).  The first
       logical line of each rule is a perl expression.	It may be any valid
       perl expression whose evaluated (with 'eval') result may be used as the
       argument to a perl 'if' statement.  The second logical line should be
       the name of the XFree86 video driver to use when the rule is true, and
       subsequent logical lines of each rule, if present, are additional con-
       figuration output for the video device's 1mXF86Config Device 22msection.
       The driver name and additional lines of configuration information are
       written to standard output when the rule is chosen as the successful
       rule.

       Pseudo rules consisting of perl expressions may be present in the file
       for the purpose of defining custom perl variables or setting the weight
       to use for the following rules.	Pseudo rules are rules that consist of
       a single logical line only, and they are never candidates themselves
       for the successful rule.

       Several perl variables are pre-defined, and may be used within rules.
       They include:

	   1m$vendor		     22mPCI vendor ID
	   1m$device		     22mPCI device ID
	   1m$revision		     22mPCI revision ID
	   1m$subsys		     22mPCI subsystem ID
	   1m$subsysVendor	     22mPCI subsystem vendor ID
	   1m$class		     22mPCI class
	   1m$sbuspath		     22mSBUS path
	   1m$XFree86Version	     22mXFree86 version, as a 'v' string
	   1m$XFree86VersionNumeric  22mXFree86 numeric version
	   1m$XFree86VersionMajor    22mXFree86 major version
	   1m$XFree86VersionMinor    22mXFree86 minor version
	   1m$XFree86VersionPatch    22mXFree86 patch version
	   1m$XFree86VersionSnap     22mXFree86 snap version
	   1m$weight		     22mcurrent rule weight

       The 1m$weight 22mvariable determines the weight of the rules as they are
       processed.  The weight for subsequent rules may be set with a pseudo
       rule that sets or changes the value of 1m$weight22m.  The default weight,
       and the weight used for built-in rules is 500.  The meta-configuration
       files are processed in an unpredictable order.  The weighting of the
       rules is used to determine their relative priority

       After processing all of the rules, both built-in and those read from
       the meta-configuration files, the 1mgetconfig 22mprogram chooses as the suc-
       cessful rule the last and highest weighted rule that evaluates to true.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mapm 22mis an XFree86 driver for Alliance ProMotion video cards. The driver
       is accelerated for supported hardware/depth combination. It supports
       framebuffer depths of 8, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits. For 6420, 6422, AT24,
       AT3D and AT25, all depths are fully accelerated except 24 bpp for which
       only screen to screen copy and rectangle filling is accelerated.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mapm 22mdriver supports PCI and ISA video cards on the following
       Alliance ProMotion chipsets

       1mProMotion 64200m

       1mProMotion 64220m

       1mAT240m

       1mAT3D0m

       1mAT250m

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "6422", "at24", "at3d".

       The AT25 is Chipset "at3d" and the 6420 is 6422.

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chips. The actual amount of video memory can also be specified with a
       1mVideoRam 22mentry in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the hardware cursor.  Default: on.

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Force the software cursor.  Default: off.

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "NoLinear" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable use of linear frame buffer. Default: on.
	      Note: it may or may not work. Tell me if you need it.

       1mOption "PciRetry" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

       1mOption "Remap_DPMS_On" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m

       1mOption "Remap_DPMS_Off" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Remaps the corresponding DPMS events. I've found that my Her-
	      cules 128/3D swaps Off and Suspend events. You can correct that
	      with
		     1mOption "Remap_DPMS_Suspend" "Off"0m
		     1mOption "Remap_DPMS_Off" "Suspend"0m
	      in the 1mDevice 22msection of the config file.

       tains full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit pixel depths, hardware
       acceleration of drawing primitives, hardware cursor, video modes up to
       1800x1440 @ 70Hz, doublescan modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240), gamma
       correction at all pixel depths, a fully programming dot clock and
       robust text mode restoration for VT switching.  Dualhead is supported
       on M3/M4 mobile chips.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mr128 22mdriver supports all ATI Rage 128 based video cards including
       the Rage Fury AGP 32MB, the XPERT 128 AGP 16MB and the XPERT 99 AGP
       8MB.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
       the card.  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can
       specify:

	   VideoRam - in kilobytes
	   MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
	   IOBase   - physical address of the MMIO registers
	   ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID

       In addition, the following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "SWcursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Selects software cursor.	The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.  The default is
	      to 1menable 22mhardware acceleration.

       1mOption "Dac6Bit" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when
	      in 8 bpp mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per
	      color component are used.	 The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "VideoKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
	      key.  The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "Display" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Select display mode for devices which support flat panels. Sup-
	      ported modes are:

	      1m"FP" 22m- use flat panel;

	      1m"CRT" 22m- use cathode ray tube;

	      1m"Mirror" 22m- use both FP and CRT;

	      1m"BIOS" 22m- use mode as configured in the BIOS.

	      The default is 1mFP.0m


       The following 1mOptions 22mare mostly important for non-x86 architectures:

       1mOption "ProgramFPRegs" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable programming of the flat panel registers.
	      Beware that this may damage your panel, so use this 1mat your own0m
	      1mrisk.  22mThe default depends on the device.

       1mOption "PanelWidth" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m

       1mOption "PanelHeight" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Override the flat panel dimensions in pixels. They are used to
	      program the flat panel registers and normally determined using
	      the video card BIOS. If the wrong dimensions are used, the sys-
	      tem may hang.

       1mOption "UseFBDev" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device
	      interface (which is not supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4)
	      for further information.	Default: off.

       1mOption "DMAForXv" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Try or don't try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will
	      reduce CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may
	      cause instabilities.  Default: off.


       The following additional 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShowCache" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory.	 A development
	      debug option.  Default: off.


       1mDualhead Note: 22mThe video BIOS on some laptops interacts strangely with
       dualhead.  This can result in flickering and problems changing modes on
       crtc2.  If you experience these problems, try toggling your laptop's
       video output switch (e.g. fn-f7, etc.) prior to starting X or switch to
       another VT and back.

       The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
       the card.  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can
       specify:

	   VideoRam - in kilobytes

       In addition, the following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "SWcursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Selects software cursor.	The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.
	      The default is to 1menable 22mhardware acceleration.

       1mOption "Dac6Bit" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when
	      in 8 bpp mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per
	      color component are used.
	      The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "VideoKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
	      key.
	      The default value is 1m0x1E.0m

       1mOption "UseFBDev" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device
	      interface (which is not supported on all OSs).  MergedFB does
	      not work when this option is in use.  See fbdevhw(4) for further
	      information.
	      The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "AGPMode" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set AGP data transfer rate.  (used only when DRI is enabled)
	      1	     -- x1 (default)
	      2	     -- x2
	      4	     -- x4
	      8	     -- x8
	      others -- invalid

       1mOption "AGPFastWrite" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable AGP fast write.  Enabling this option is frequently the
	      cause of instability. Used only when the DRI is enabled.
	      The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "BusType" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Used to replace previous ForcePCIMode option.  Should only be
	      used when driver's bus detection is incorrect or you want to
	      force a AGP card to PCI mode. Should NEVER force a PCI card to
	      AGP bus.
	      PCI    -- PCI bus
	      AGP    -- AGP bus
	      PCIE   -- PCI Express (falls back to PCI at present)
	      (used only when DRI is enabled)
	      The default is 1mauto detect.0m

       1mOption "DDCMode" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Force to use the modes queried from the connected monitor.
	      The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "DisplayPriority" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Used to prevent flickering or tearing problem caused by display
	      buffer underflow.
	      AUTO   -- Driver calculated (default).
	      BIOS   -- Remain unchanged from BIOS setting.
			Use this if the calculation is not correct
			for your card.
	      HIGH   -- Force to the highest priority.
			Use this if you have problem with above options.
			This might affect performance slightly.
	      The default value is 1mAUTO.0m

       1mOption "MonitorLayout" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      This option is used to overwrite the detected monitor types.
	      This is only required when driver makes a false detection.  The
	      possible monitor types are:
	      NONE   -- Not connected
	      CRT    -- Analog CRT monitor
	      TMDS   -- Desktop flat panel
	      LVDS   -- Laptop flat panel
	      This option can be used in following format:
	      Option "MonitorLayout" "[type on primary], [type on secondary]"
	      For example, Option "MonitorLayout" "CRT, TMDS"

	      Primary/Secondary head for dual-head cards:
	      (when only one port is used, it will be treated as the primary
	      regardless)
	      1mPrimary head:0m
	      DVI port on DVI+VGA cards
	      LCD output on laptops
	      Internal TMDS port on DVI+DVI cards
	      1mSecondary head:0m
	      VGA port on DVI+VGA cards
	      VGA port on laptops
	      External TMDS port on DVI+DVI cards

	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "MergedFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This enables merged framebuffer mode.  In this mode you have a
	      single shared framebuffer with two viewports looking into it.
	      It is similar to Xinerama, but has some advantages.  It is
	      faster than Xinerama, the DRI works on both heads, and it sup-
	      ports clone modes.
	      Merged framebuffer mode provides two linked viewports looking
	      into a single large shared framebuffer.  The size of the frame-
	      buffer is determined by the 1mVirtual 22mkeyword defined on the
	      1mScreen 22msection of your XF86Config file.  It works just like reg-
	      ular virtual desktop except you have two viewports looking into
	      it instead of one.
	      For example, if you wanted a desktop composed of two 1024x768
	      viewports looking into a single desktop you would create a vir-
	      tual desktop of 2048x768 (left/right) or 1024x1536
	      (above/below), e.g.,
	      1mVirtual 2048 768 22mor 1mVirtual 1024 15360m
	      The virtual desktop can be larger than the size of the viewports
	      looking into it.	In this case the linked viewports will scroll
	      around in the virtual desktop.  Viewports with different sizes
	      are also supported (e.g., one that is 1024x768 and one that is
	      640x480).	 In this case the smaller viewport will scroll rela-
	      tive to the larger one such that none of the virtual desktop is
	      inaccessible.  If you do not define a virtual desktop the driver
	      will create one based on the orientation of the heads and size
	      of the largest defined mode in the display section that is sup-
	      ported on each head.
	      The relation of the viewports in specified by the 1mCRT2Position0m
	      Option.  The options are 1mClone 22m, 1mLeftOf 22m, 1mRightOf 22m, 1mAbove 22m, and
	      1mBelow.	22mMergedFB is enabled by default if a monitor is detected
	      on each output.  If no position is given it defaults to clone
	      mode (the old clone options are now deprecated, also, the option
	      OverlayOnCRTC2 has been replaced by the Xv attribute
	      XV_SWITCHCRT; the overlay can be switched to CRT1 or CRT2 on the
	      fly in clone mode).
	      The maximum framebuffer size that the 2D acceleration engine can
	      handle is 8192x8192.  The maximum framebuffer size that the 3D
	      engine can handle is 2048x2048.
	      1mNote: 22mPage flipping does not work well in certain configurations
	      with MergedFB.  If you see rendering errors or other strange
	      behavior, disable page flipping. Also MergedFB is not compatible
	      with the 1mUseFBDev 22moption.
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "CRT2HSync" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the horizontal sync range for the secondary  monitor.	 It is
	      not required if a DDC-capable monitor is connected.
	      For example, Option "CRT2HSync" "30.0-86.0"
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "CRT2VRefresh" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the vertical refresh range for the secondary monitor.	 It is
	      not required if a DDC-capable monitor is connected.
	      For example, Option "CRT2VRefresh" "50.0-120.0"
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "CRT2Position" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the relationship of CRT2 relative to CRT1. Valid options
	      are: 1mClone 22m, 1mLeftOf 22m, 1mRightOf 22m, 1mAbove 22m, and 1mBelow0m
	      For example, Option "CRT2Position" "RightOf"
	      This option also supports an offset.  This is most useful when
	      1mMergedNonRectangular 22mis enabled.  For example if you want CRT2
	      to be offset 100 pixels down from the start of CRT1, you'd type:
	      Option "CRT2Position" "LeftOf 100"
	      The offset is vertical for LeftOf and RightOf and horizontal for
	      Above and Below.	Offsets can be positive or negative.
	      The default value is 1mClone.0m

       1mOption "MetaModes" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      MetaModes are mode combinations for CRT1 and CRT2.  If you are
	      using merged frame buffer mode and want to change modes (CTRL-
	      ALT-+/-), these define which modes will be switched to on CRT1
	      and CRT2.	 The MetaModes are defined as CRT1Mode-CRT2Mode
	      (800x600-1024x768).  Modes listed individually (800x600) define
	      clone modes, that way you can mix clone modes with non-clone
	      modes.  Also some programs require "standard" modes.  If you
	      want to add clone modes of different refreshes or sizes to the
	      mix, they are defined as CRT1Mode+CRT2Mode (800x600+1024x768).
	      Note:  Any mode you use in the MetaModes must be defined in the
	      1mScreen 22msection of your XF86Config file.  Modes not defined there
	      will be ignored when the MetaModes are parsed since the driver
	      uses them to make sure the monitors can handle those modes.  If
	      you do not define a MetaMode the driver will create one based on
	      the orientation of the heads and size of the largest defined
	      mode in the display section that is supported on each head.
	      1mModes 1024x768 800x600 640x4800m
	      For example, Option "MetaModes" "1024x768-1024x768
	      800x600-1024x768 640x480-800x600 800x600"
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "MergedXinerama" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Since merged framebuffer mode does not use Xinerama, apps are
	      not able to intelligently place windows.	Merged framebuffer
	      mode provides its own pseudo-Xinerama.  This allows Xinerama
	      compliant applications to place windows appropriately.  There
	      are some caveats.	 Since merged framebuffer mode is able to
	      change relative screen sizes and orientations on the fly, as
	      well has having overlapping viewports, pseudo-Xinerama, might
	      not always provide the right hints.  Also many Xinerama compli-
	      ant applications only query Xinerama once at startup; if the
	      information changes, they might not be aware of the change.  If
	      you are already using Xinerama (e.g., a single head card and a
	      dualhead card providing three heads), pseudo-Xinerama will be
	      disabled.
	      This option allows you turn off the driver provided pseudo-Xin-
	      erama extension.
	      The default value is 1mTRUE.0m

       1mOption "MergedXineramaCRT2IsScreen0" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      By default the pseudo-Xinerama provided by the driver makes the
	      left-most or bottom head Xinerama screen 0.  Certain Xinerama-
	      aware applications do special things with screen 0.  To change
	      that behavior, use this option.
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "MergedDPI" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      The driver will attempt to figure out an appropriate DPI based
	      on the DDC information and the orientation of the heads when in
	      merged framebuffer mode.	If this value does not suit you, you
	      can manually set the DPI using this option.
	      For example, Option "MergedDPI" "100 100"
	      The default value is 1mundefined.0m

       1mOption "MergedNonRectangular" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      If you are using MergedFB with two modes of different sizes,
	      turn this option on to keep the smaller head from scrolling
	      within the larger virtual desktop and to keep the mouse from
	      moving into that area.  Applications that are not Xinerama aware
	      can potentially end up stranded in this area.
	      The default value is 1mFALSE.0m

       1mOption "ColorTiling" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Frame buffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode.
	      Tiled mode can provide significant performance benefits with 3D
	      applications, for 2D it shouldn't matter much. Tiling will be
	      disabled if the virtual x resolution exceeds 2048 (3968 for R300
	      and above), if option 1mUseFBDev 22mis used, or (if DRI is enabled)
	      the drm module is too old.
	      If this option is enabled, a new dri driver is required for
	      direct rendering too.
	      Color tiling will be automatically disabled in interlaced or
	      doublescan screen modes.
	      The default value is 1mon.0m

       1mOption "IgnoreEDID" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Do not use EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used
	      for monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option.
	      The default value is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "PanelSize" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Should only be used when driver cannot detect the correct panel
	      size.  Apply to both desktop (TMDS) and laptop (LVDS) digital
	      panels.  When a valid panel size is specified, the timings col-
	      lected from DDC and BIOS will not be used. If you have a panel
	      with timings different from that of a standard VESA mode, you
	      have to provide this information through the Modeline.
	      For example, Option "PanelSize" "1400x1050"
	      The default value is 1mnone.0m

       1mOption "PanelOff" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable panel output.
	      The default value is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "EnablePageFlip" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable page flipping for 3D acceleration. This will increase
	      performance but not work correctly in some rare cases, hence the
	      default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "ForceMinDotClock" "4m22mfrequency24m1m"0m
	      Override minimum dot clock. Some Radeon BIOSes report a minimum
	      dot clock unsuitable (too high) for use with television sets
	      even when they actually can produce lower dot clocks. If this is
	      the case you can override the value here.	 1mNote that using this0m
	      1moption might damage your hardware.  22mYou have been warned. The
	      1mfrequency 22mparameter may be specified as a float value with stan-
	      dard suffixes like "k", "kHz", "M", "MHz".

       1mOption "DepthBits" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Precision in bits per pixel of the shared depth buffer used for
	      3D acceleration.	Valid values are 16 and 24. When this is 24,
	      there will also be a hardware accelerated stencil buffer, but
	      the combined depth/stencil buffer will take up twice as much
	      video RAM as when it's 16.  Default: 1mThe same as the screen0m
	      1mdepth.0m

       1mOption "DMAForXv" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Try or don't try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will
	      reduce CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but might
	      cause instabilities.  Default: 1mon.0m

       1mOption "SubPixelOrder" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Force subpixel order to specified order.	Subpixel order is used
	      for subpixel decimation on flat panels.
	      NONE   -- No subpixel (CRT like displays)
	      RGB    -- in horizontal RGB order (most flat panels)
	      BGR    -- in horizontal BGR order (some flat panels)

	      This option is intended to be used in following cases:
	      1. The default subpixel order is incorrect for your panel.
	      2. Enable subpixel decimation on analog panels.
	      3. Adjust to one display type in dual-head clone mode setup.
	      4. Get better performance with Render acceleration on digital
	      panels (use NONE setting).
	      The default is 1mNONE 22mfor CRT, 1mRGB 22mfor digital panels

       1mOption "DynamicClocks" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable dynamic clock scaling.  The on-chip clocks will scale
	      dynamically based on usage. This can help reduce heat and
	      increase battery life by reducing power usage.  Some users
	      report reduced 3D performance with this enabled.	The default is
	      1moff.0m

       1mOption "BIOSHotkeys" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable BIOS hotkey output switching. This allows the BIOS to
	      toggle outputs using hotkeys (e.g., fn-f7, etc.).	 Since the
	      driver does not support ACPI, there is no way to validate modes
	      on an output switch and the BIOS can potentially change things
	      behind the driver's back.	 The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "ReverseDDC" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      When BIOS connector informations aren't available, use this
	      option to reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use this
	      if the X serve obviously detects the wrong display for each con-
	      nector. This is typically needed on the Radeon 9600 cards bun-
	      dled with Apple G5s. The default is 1moff.0m

       1mOption "LVDSProbePLL" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      When BIOS panel informations aren't available (like on Power-
	      Books), it might still be necessary to use the firmware provided
	      PLL values for the panel or flickering will happen. This option
	      will force probing of the current value programmed in the chip
	      when X is launched in that case.	This is only useful for LVDS
	      panels (laptop internal panels).	The default is 1mon.0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mchips 22mis an XFree86 driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.
       The majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are supported by
       this driver. In general the limitation on the capabilities of this
       driver are determined by the chipset on which it is run. Where possi-
       ble, this driver provides full acceleration and supports the following
       depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an 8+16 overlay
       mode. All visual types are supported for depth 1, 4 and 8 and both
       TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported where possible. Multi-
       head configurations are supported on PCI or AGP buses.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mchips 22mdriver supports video processors on most of the bus types
       currently available.  The chipsets supported fall into one of three
       architectural classes. A 1mbasic 22marchitecture, the 1mWinGine 22marchitecture
       and the newer 1mHiQV 22marchitecture.

       1mBasic Architecture0m

       The supported chipsets are 1mct65520, ct65525, ct65530, ct65535, ct65540,0m
       1mct65545, ct65546 22mand 1mct655480m

       Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15,
       16 and 24 are supported only on the 1m65540, 65545, 65546 22mand 1m655480m
       chipsets. The driver is accelerated when used with the 1m65545, 65546 22mor
       1m65548 22mchipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.

       1mWingine Architecture0m

       The supported chipsets are 1mct64200 22mand 1mct643000m

       Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on both chipsets, while depths
       15, 16 and 24 are supported only on the 1m64300 22mchipsets. The driver is
       accelerated when used with the 1m64300 22mchipsets, however the DirectColor
       visual is not available.

       1mHiQV Architecture0m

       The supported chipsets are 1mct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554, ct690000m
       and 1mct690300m

       Color depths 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and 8+16 are supported on all
       chipsets.  The DirectColor visual is supported on all color depths
       except the 8+16 overlay mode. Full acceleration is supplied for all
       chipsets.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "ct65520", "ct65525", "ct65530", "ct65535", "ct65540", "ct65545",
	   "ct65546", "ct65548", "ct65550", "ct65554", "ct65555", "ct68554",
	   "ct69000", "ct69030", "ct64200", "ct64300".

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chipsets.  But maybe overridden with the 1mVideoRam 22mentry in the config
       file 1m"Device" 22msection.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported, on one or more of the sup-
       ported chipsets:

	      bus.  Default: off.

       1mOption "Crt2Memory" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      In a dual-head mode (69030 only) this option selects the amount
	      of memory to set aside for the second head. If not specified,
	      half the memory is used.	Default: off.

       1mOption "DualRefresh" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      The 69030 supports independent refresh rates on its two display
	      channels.	 This mode of operations uses additional memory band-
	      width and thus limits the maximum colour depth and refresh rate
	      that can be achieved, and so is off by default.  Using this
	      option forces the use of an independent refresh rate on the two
	      screens.	Default: off.

	      1mChipRev HWcursor NoAccel Rotate ShadowFB0m

       1mcirrus_alpine module:0m
	      1mChipRev HWcursor MemCFG1 MemCFG2 MMIO NoAccel Rotate ShadowFB0m

       1mVideoRam0m
	      If VideoRam is specified, that setting is respected and memory
	      is not probed.




       1mOption "Clocks"0m
	      1mClocks 22mline may not be specified for Cirrus chips.

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor.	Hardware cursor sizes of 32
	      and 64 are supported in the "Alpine" module.  Hardware cursor
	      size of 64 is supported in the "Laguna" module.  Default: on for
	      7548, 7555/6; otherwise off.

       1mOption "MemCFG1" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m

       1mOption "MemCFG2" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      May configure memory on non-primary cards.  "Alpine" module does
	      not yet know how to configure memory.  Use options MemCFG1 and
	      MemCFG2 to set registers SR0F and SR17 before trying to count
	      ram size.	 The 754x supports MMIO for the BitBlt engine but not
	      for the VGA registers.  The 754x may have difficulty with 2 256K
	      X 16 DRAMs (1024) or 4 512K X 8 DRAMs (2048).  The 7555/6
	      assumes 2048.  Default: memory automatically detected.

       1mOption "MMIO" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      By default, MMIO is used if we have a separate IOAddress and not
	      in monochrome mode (1 bpp).  When MMIO is not used, RAC IO flags
	      RAC_COLORMAP, RAC_CURSOR, RAC_VIEWPORT, and RAC_FB are set.
	      Default: on

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Acceleration can not be used in
	      less than 8 bpp.	Default: Acceleration disabled for 5436, 5480,
	      7548; otherwise enabled.

       1mOption "PciRetry" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.	 This mode is
	      unaccelerated.  This mode forces use of the shadow framebuffer
	      layer.  Screen depth must be less than 8 bpp with "Alpine" mod-
	      ule.  HW cursor is disabled with 1mRotate.  22mDefault: no rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  This
	      mode is unaccelerated.  Screen depth must be less than 8 bpp
	      with "Alpine" module.  Default: off.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mcyrix 22mis an XFree86 driver for the Cyrix MediaGX (now Natsemi Geode)
       series of processors when using the built in video.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mcyrix 22mdriver supports the MediaGX, MediaGXi and MediaGXm proces-
       sors, as well as the Natsemi 'Geode' branded processors. It supports
       the CS5510, CS5520, CS5530 and CS5530A companion chips. The driver sup-
       ports 4, 8, 15 and 16 bit deep displays with video compression and
       acceleration.

       The MediaGX run length compresses its shared framebuffer, for the best
       performance on a MediaGX machine pick backgrounds that compress well
       horizonally.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This

	      Cyrix based tablet PC systems. This mode is currently unacceler-
	      ated.  Default: no rotation.

1mBUGS0m
       This driver has not been tested on the original 5510 hardware for some
       considerable time.

       8bit mode does not currently work on the CS5510 with external RAMDAC.

       The 5530A video overlay facility is not currently supported.

       XFree86 uses the MediaGX 'SoftVGA' interface. On a small number of
       boards this is buggy and may result in strange illegal instruction
       traps.

       Hardware cursors are not currently supported.

       1mEndSection0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mfbdev 22mis an XFree86 driver for framebuffer devices.	 This is a non-
       accelerated driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported: 8,
       15, 16, 24.  All visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor
       visual is supported for the other depths.  Multi-head configurations
       are supported.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mfbdev 22mdriver supports all hardware where a framebuffer driver is
       available.  fbdev uses the os-specific submodule fbdevhw(4) to talk to
       the kernel device driver.  Currently a fbdevhw module is available for
       linux.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen sec-
       tion of the config file.	 The 1mfbdev 22mdriver can pick up the currently
       used video mode from the framebuffer driver and will use it if there
       are no video modes configured.

       For PCI boards you might have to add a BusID line to the Device sec-
       tion.  See above for a sample line.  You can use "XFree86 -scanpci" to
       figure out the correct values.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "fbdev" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      The framebuffer device to use. Default: /dev/fb0.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      on.

       1mOption "Rotate" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Enable rotation of the display. The supported values are "CW"
	      (clockwise, 90 degrees), "UD" (upside down, 180 degrees) and
	      "CCW" (counter clockwise, 270 degrees). Implies use of the
	      shadow framebuffer layer.	  Default: off.

       glide - Glide video driver

1mSYNOPSIS0m

	 1mDriver "glide"0m
	 ...

1mREAD THIS IF NOTHING ELSE0m
       This driver has a special requirement that needs to be fulfilled before
       it will work: You need Glide installed and you need to make a link for
       the libglide2x.so file. Read the second paragraph in the description
       below to find out how.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mglide 22mis an XFree86 driver for Glide capable video boards (such as 3Dfx
       Voodoo boards). This driver is mainly for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 boards,
       later boards from 3Dfx have 2D built-in and you should preferably use a
       driver separate for those boards or the fbdev(4) driver.	 This driver
       is a bit special because Voodoo 1 and 2 boards are very much NOT made
       for running 2D graphics. Therefore, this driver uses no hardware accel-
       eration (since there is no acceleration for 2D, only 3D). Instead it is
       implemented with the help of a "shadow" framebuffer that resides
       entirely in RAM. Selected portions of this shadow framebuffer are then
       copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this, the
       speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. But since the CPU is
       nowadays actually rather fast at moving data, we get very good speed
       anyway, especially since the whole shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.

       This driver requires that you have installed Glide. (Which can, at the
       time of this writing, be found at
       http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html). Also, you need to tell
       XFree86 where the libglide2x.so file is placed by making a soft link in
       the /usr/X11R6/lib/modules directory that points to the libglide2x.so
       file. For example (if your libglide2x.so file is in /usr/lib):

	 # ln -s /usr/lib/libglide2x.so /usr/X11R6/lib/modules

       If you have installed /dev/3dfx, the driver will be able to turn on the
       MTRR registers (through the glide library) if you have a CPU with such
       registers (see http://glide.xxedgexx.com/MTRR.html). This will speed up
       copying data to the Voodoo board by as much as 2.7 times and is very
       noticeable since this driver copies a lot of data... Highly recom-
       mended.

       This driver supports 16 and 24 bit color modes. The 24 bit color mode
       uses a 32 bit framebuffer (it has no support for 24 bit packed-pixel
       framebuffers). Notice that the Voodoo boards can only display 16 bit
       color, but the shadow framebuffer can be run in 24 bit color. The point
       of supporting 24 bit mode is that this enables you to run in a multi-
       head configuration with Xinerama together with another board that runs
       in real 24 bit color mode. (All boards must run the same color depth
       when you use Xinerama).

       Resolutions supported are: 640x480, 800x600, 960x720, 1024x768,
       1280x1024 and 1600x1200. Note that not all modes will work on all
       Voodoo boards. It seems that Voodoo 2 boards support no higher than
       1024x768 and Voodoo 1 boards can go to 800x600. If you see a message
       like this in the output from the server:

	 (EE) GLIDE(0): grSstWinOpen returned ...

       Then you are probably trying to use a resolution that is supported by
       the driver but not supported by the hardware.

       Refresh rates supported are: 60Hz, 75Hz and 85Hz. The refresh rate used
       is derived from the normal mode line according to the following table:

       Mode-line refresh rate	   Used refresh rate

	  0-74 Hz		     60 Hz

	 74-84 Hz		     75 Hz

	 84-   Hz		     85 Hz

       Thus, if you use a modeline that for example has a 70Hz refresh rate
       you will only get a 60Hz refresh rate in actuality.

       Selecting which Voodoo board to use with the driver is done by using an
       option called "GlideDevice" in the "Device" section. (If you don't have
       this option present then the first board found will be selected for
       that Device section). For example: To use the first Voodoo board, use a
       "Device" section like this, for example:

       Section "Device"
	  Identifier  "Voodoo"
	  Driver      "glide"
	  Option      "dpms" "on"
	  Option      "GlideDevice" "0"
       EndSection

       And if you have more than one Voodoo board, add another "Device" sec-
       tion with a GlideDevice option with value 1, and so on. (You can use
       more than one Voodoo board, but SLI configured boards will be treated
       as a single board.)

       Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported.

       Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available. The "standby" and
       "suspend" modes are just painting the screen black. The "off" mode
       turns the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.

       This driver does not support a virtual screen size different from the
       display size.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mglide 22mdriver supports any board that can be used with Glide (such
       as 3Dfx Voodoo boards)

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "OnAtExit" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      If true, will leave the Voodoo board on when the server exits.
	      Useful in a multihead setup when only the Voodoo board is con-
	      nected to a second monitor and you don't want that monitor to
	      lose signal when you quit the server. Put this option in the
	      Device section.  Default: off.

       1mOption "GlideDevice" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Selects which Voodoo board to use. (Or boards, in an SLI config-
	      uration).	 The value should be 0 for the first board, 1 for the
	      second and so on.	 If it is not present, the first Voodoo board
	      found will be selected.  Put this option in the Device section.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       Here is an example of a part of an XF86Config file that uses a multi-
       head configuration with two monitors. The first monitor is driven by
       the fbdev video driver and the second monitor is driven by the glide
       driver.

       EndSection

       If you use this configuration file and start the server with the +xin-
       erama command line option, the two monitors will be showing a single
       large area where windows can be moved between monitors and overlap from
       one monitor to the other. Starting the X server with the Xinerama
       extension can be done for example like this:

       $ xinit -- +xinerama

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mglint 22mis an XFree86 driver for 3Dlabs & Texas Instruments GLINT/Perme-
       dia based video cards. The driver is rather fully accelerated, and pro-
       vides support for the following framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (may give bad
       results with FBDev support), 16, 24 (32 bpp recommended, 24 bpp has
       problems), 30, and an 8+24 overlay mode.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mglint 22mdriver supports 3Dlabs (GLINT MX, GLINT 500TX, GLINT 300SX,
       GLINT GAMMA, GLINT DELTA, GLINT GAMMA2, Permedia, Permedia 2, Permedia
       2v, Permedia 3, R3, R4) and Texas Instruments (Permedia, Permedia 2)
       chips.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "ti_pm2", "ti_pm", "r4", "pm3", "pm2v", "pm2", "pm", "300sx",
	   "500tx", "mx", "gamma", "gamma2", "delta"

       The driver will try to auto-detect the amount of video memory present
       for all chips.  If it's not detected correctly, the actual amount of
       video memory should be specified with a 1mVideoRam 22mentry in the config
       file 1m"Device" 22msection.

       Additionally, you may need to specify the bus ID of your card with a
       1mBusID 22mentry in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection, especially with FBDev
       support.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "UseFlatPanel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable the FlatPanel feature on the Permedia3.  Default: off.

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the SW cursor.	Default: off.  This option
	      disables the 1mHWCursor 22moption and vice versa.

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "Overlay"0m
	      Enable 8+24 overlay mode.	 Only appropriate for depth 24, 32
	      bpp.  (1mNote: 22mThis hasn't been tested with FBDev support and
	      probably won't work.)  Recognized values are: "8,24", "24,8".
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "PciRetry" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable PCI retries.  (1mNote: 22mThis doesn't work with
	      Permedia2 based cards for Amigas.)  Default: off.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  (1mNote:0m
	      This disables hardware acceleration.)  Default: off.

       1mOption "UseFBDev" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of an OS-specific fb interface (which is
	      not supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4) for further informa-
	      tion.  Default: off.

       1mOption "BlockWrite" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable block writes for the various Permedia 2 chips.
	      This improves acceleration in general, but disables it for some
	      special cases.  Default: off.

       1mOption "FireGL3000" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      If you have a card of the same name, turn this on.  Default:
	      off.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mi810 22mis an XFree86 driver for Intel integrated graphics chipsets.  The
       driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24.	 All visual types are sup-
       ported in depth 8.  For the i810/i815 other depths support the True-
       Color and DirectColor visuals.  For the 830M and later, only the True-
       Color visual is supported for depths greater than 8.  The driver sup-
       ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct Rendering Infrastructure
       (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for
       the 830M and later.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       1mi810 22msupports the i810, i810-DC100, i810e, i815, 830M, 845G, 852GM,
       855GM, 865G, 915G and 915GM chipsets.


1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The Intel 8xx family of integrated graphics chipsets has a unified mem-
       ory architecture and uses system memory for video ram.  For the i810
       and i815 familiy of chipset, operating system support for allocating
       system memory for video use is required in order to use this driver.
       For the 830M and later, this is required in order for the driver to use
       more video ram than has been pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS.
       This is usually achieved with an "agpgart" or "agp" kernel driver.
       Linux, and recent versions of FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD have such
       kernel drivers available.

       By default 8 Megabytes of system memory are used for graphics.  For the
       830M and later, the default is 8 Megabytes when DRI is not enabled and
       32 Megabytes with DRI is enabled.  This amount may be changed with the
       1mVideoRam 22mentry in the config file 1mDevice 22msection.  It may be set to any
       reasonable value up to 64MB for older chipsets or 128MB for newer
       chipets.	 It is advisable to check the XFree86 log file to check if any
       features have been disabled because of insufficient video memory.  In
       particular, DRI support or tiling mode may be disabled with insuffi-
       cient video memory.  Either of these being disabled will reduce perfor-
       mance for 3D applications.  Note however, that increasing this value
       too much will reduce the amount of system memory available for other
       applications.

       The driver makes use of the video BIOS to program video modes for the
       830M and later.	This limits the video modes that can be used to those
       provided by the video BIOS, and to those that will fit into the amount
       of video memory that the video BIOS is aware of.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable software cursor.  Default: software cursor is
	      disable and a hardware cursor is used for configurations where
	      the hardware cursor is available.

       1mOption "ColorKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
	      Default: undefined.

       1mOption "CacheLines" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory
	      used for 2D acceleration and video.  Decreasing this amount
	      leaves more for 3D textures.  Increasing it can improve 2D per-
	      formance at the expense of 3D performance.  Default: depends on
	      the resolution, depth, and available video memory.  The driver
	      attempts to allocate at least enough to hold two DVD-sized YUV
	      buffers by default.  The default used for a specific configura-
	      tion can be found by examining the XFree86 log file.

       1mOption "DRI" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable DRI support.  Default: DRI is enabled for con-
	      figurations where it is supported.


       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported for the i810 and i815
       chipsets:

       1mOption "DDC" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable DDC support.  Default: enabled.

       1mOption "Dac6Bit" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.	 Default:
	      8-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.

       1mOption "XvMCSurfaces" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option enables XvMC.	 The integer parameter specifies the
	      number of surfaces to use.  Valid values are 6 and 7.  Default:
	      XvMC is disabled.


       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported for the 830M and later
       chipsets:

       1mOption "VBERestore" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the use of VBE save/restore for saving and
	      restoring the initial text mode.	This is disabled by default
	      because it causes lockups on some platforms.  However, there are
	      some cases where it must enabled for the correct restoration of
	      the initial video mode.  If you are having a problem with that,
	      try enabling this option.	 Default: Disabled.

       1mOption "VideoKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This is the same as the 1m"ColorKey" 22moption described above.  It
	      is provided for compatibility with most other drivers.

       1mOption "XVideo" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable XVideo support.	 Default: XVideo is enabled
	      for configurations where it is supported.

       1mOption "MonitorLayout" "4m22manystr24m1m"0m
	      Allow different monitor configurations. e.g. "CRT,LFP" will con-
	      figure a CRT on Pipe A and an LFP on Pipe B. Regardless of the
	      primary heads' pipe it is always configured as
	      "<PIPEA>,<PIPEB>".  Additionally you can add different configu-
	      rations such as "CRT+DFP,LFP" which would put a digital flat
	      panel and a CRT on pipe A, and a local flat panel on pipe B.
	      For single pipe configurations you can just specify the monitors
	      types on Pipe A, such as "CRT+DFP" which will enable the CRT and
	      DFP on Pipe A.  Valid monitors are CRT, LFP, DFP, TV, CRT2,
	      LFP2, DFP2, TV2 and NONE.	 NOTE: Some configurations of monitor
	      types may fail, this depends on the Video BIOS and system con-
	      figuration.  Default: Not configured, and will use the current
	      head's pipe and monitor.

       1mOption "Clone" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable Clone mode on pipe B. This will setup the second head as
	      a complete mirror of the monitor attached to pipe A.  NOTE:
	      Video overlay functions will not work on the second head in this
	      mode.  If you require this, then use the MonitorLayout above and
	      do (as an example) "CRT+DFP,NONE" to configure both a CRT and
	      DFP on Pipe A to achieve local mirroring and disable the use of
	      this option.  Default: Clone mode on pipe B is disabled.

       1mOption "CloneRefresh" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      When the Clone option is specified we can drive the second moni-
	      tor at a different refresh rate than the primary.	 Default:
	      60Hz.

       1mOption "CheckDevices" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      On mobile platforms it's desirable to monitor the device status
	      and switch the outputs accordingly. For example, when the lid is
	      opened or closed, or when using hotkeys without ACPI support. By
	      default this option is on for mobile platforms and is not avail-
	      able on desktop systems.	Default: enabled.

       1mOption "FixedPipe" "4m22manystr24m1m"0m
	      When using a dual pipe system, it may be preferable to fix the
	      primary pipe such that if you boot up on an external screen you
	      may want the internal flat panel to be the primary. Using this
	      option will allow this.  Options are A or B.  Default: disabled
	      (uses current pipe as primary).

       1mOption "DisplayInfo" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      It has been found that a certain BIOS call can lockup the
	      Xserver because of a problem in the Video BIOS. The log file
	      will identify if you are suffering from this problem and tell
	      you to turn this option off.  Default: enabled

       1mOption "DevicePresence" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Tell the driver to perform an active detect of the currently
	      connected monitors. This option is useful if the monitor was not
	      connected when the machine has booted, but unfortunately it
	      doesn't always work and is extremely dependent upon the Video
	      BIOS.  Default: disabled

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the desktop 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
	      This option forces the ShadowFB option on, and disables acceler-
	      ation.  Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  This
	      option disables acceleration.  Default: off.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mmga 22mis an XFree86 driver for Matrox video cards.  The driver is fully
       accelerated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
       8, 15, 16, 24, and an 8+24 overlay mode.	 All visual types are sup-
       ported for depth 8, and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are sup-
       ported for the other depths except 8+24 mode which supports Pseudo-
       Color, GrayScale and TrueColor.	Multi-card configurations are sup-
       ported.	XVideo is supported on G200 and newer systems, with either
       1mTexturedVideo 22mor video overlay.  The second head of dual-head cards is
       supported for the G450 and G550.	 Support for the second head on G400
       cards requires a binary-only "mga_hal" module that is available from
       Matrox <http://www.matrox.com>, and may be on the CD supplied with the
       card.  That module also provides various other enhancements, and may be
       necessary to use the DVI (digital) output on the G550 (and other
       cards).

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mmga 22mdriver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the following
       Matrox chips:

       1mMGA2064W    22mMillennium (original)

       1mMGA1064SG   22mMystique

       1mMGA2164W    22mMillennium II

       1mG1000m

       1mG200	     22mMillennium G200 and Mystique G200

       1mG4000m

       1mG4500m

       1mG5500m

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "mga2064w", "mga1064sg", "mga2164w", "mga2164w agp", "mgag100",
	   "mgag200", "mgag200 pci", "mgag400", "mgag550".

       The G450 is Chipset "mgag400" with ChipRev 0x80.

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chips except the Millennium II.	In the Millennium II case it defaults
       to 4096 kBytes.	When using a Millennium II, the actual amount of video
       memory should be specified with a 1mVideoRam 22mentry in the config file
       1m"Device" 22msection.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ColorKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the colormap index used for the transparency key for the
	      depth 8 plane when operating in 8+24 overlay mode.  The value
	      must be in the range 2-255.  Default: 255.

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor.	Default: on.

       1mOption "MGASDRAM" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Specify whether G100, G200 or G400 cards have SDRAM.  The driver
	      attempts to auto-detect this based on the card's PCI subsystem
	      ID.  This option may be used to override that auto-detection.
	      The mga driver is not able to auto-detect the presence of of
	      SDRAM on secondary heads in multihead configurations so this
	      option will often need to be specified in multihead configura-
	      tions.  Default: auto-detected.

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "NoHal" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable loading the "mga_hal" module.  Default: the
	      module is loaded when available and when using hardware that it
	      supports.

       1mOption "OverclockMem"0m
	      Set clocks to values used by some commercial X-Servers (G100,
	      G200 and G400 only).  Default: off.

       1mOption "Overlay" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      Enable 8+24 overlay mode.	 Only appropriate for depth 24.	 Rec-
	      ognized values are: "8,24", "24,8". Default: off.	 (1mNote: 22mthe
	      G100 is unaccelerated in the 8+24 overlay mode due to a missing
	      hardware feature.)

       1mOption "PciRetry" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.	 This mode is
	      unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "SyncOnGreen" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable combining the sync signals with the green sig-
	      nal.  Default: off.

       1mOption "UseFBDev" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of on OS-specific fb interface (and is not
	      supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4) for further information.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "VideoKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
	      Default: undefined.

       1mOption "TexturedVideo" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This has XvImage support use the texture engine rather than the
	      video overlay.  This option is only supported by the G200 and
	      G400, and only in 16 and 32 bits per pixel.  Default: off.

       The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24 for all chipsets except the
       NM2070 which does not support depth 24.	All depths are accelerated
       except for depth 24 which is only accelerated on NM2200 and newer mod-
       els.  All visuals are supported in depth 8.  TrueColor and DirectColor
       visuals are supported in the other depths.

	      disable and a hardware cursor is used.

       1mOption "PCIBurst" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable PCI burst modes.  Default: enabled.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.	 This mode is
	      unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "OverlayMem" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Reserve the given amount of memory (in bytes) for the XVideo
	      overlay.	On boards with limited memory, display of large XVideo
	      buffers might fail due to insufficient available memory.	Using
	      this option solves the problem at the expense of reducing the
	      memory available for other operations.  For full-resolution
	      DVDs, 829440 bytes (720x576x2) are necessary.

       1mNote0m
       On some laptops using the 2160 chipset (MagicGraph 128XD) the following
       options are needed to avoid a lock-up of the graphic engine:

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory
       present for all chips.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor.	Default: on.

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "UseFBDev" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of an OS-specific fb interface (and is not
	      supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4) for further information.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "CrtcNumber" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Many graphics cards with NVIDIA chips have two video outputs.
	      The driver attempts to autodetect which one the monitor is con-
	      nected to.  In the case that autodetection picks the wrong one,
	      this option may be used to force usage of a particular output.
	      The options are "0" or "1".  Default: autodetected.

       1mOption "FlatPanel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      The driver usually can autodetect the presence of a digital flat
	      panel.  In the case that this fails, this option can be used to
	      force the driver to treat the attached device as a digital flat
	      panel.  With this driver, a digital flat panel will work only if
	      it was POSTed by the BIOS, that is, the computer must have
	      booted to the panel.  If you have a dual head card you may also
	      need to set the option CrtcNumber described above.  Default:
	      autodetected.

       1mOption "FPDither" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Many digital flat panels (particularly ones on laptops) have
	      only 6 bits per component color resolution.  This option tells
	      the driver to dither from 8 bits per component to 6 before the
	      flat panel truncates it.	Default: off.

       1mOption "FPScale" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Supported only on GeForce4 and newer chips, this option tells to
	      the driver to scale lower resolutions up to the flat panel's
	      native resolution.  Default: on.


       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.	 This mode is
	      unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

	      Note: The Resize and Rotate extension will be disabled if the
	      Rotate option is used.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      off.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mrendition 22mis an XFree86 driver for Rendition/Micron based video cards.
       The driver supports following framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (Verite V1000
       only), 16 and 24. Acceleration and multi-head configurations are not
       supported yet, but are work in progress.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mrendition 22mdriver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the fol-
       lowing Rendition/Micron chips:

       1mV1000	     22mVerite V1000 based cards.

       1mV2100	     22mVerite V2100 based cards. Diamond Stealth II S220 is the
		   only known such card.

       1mV2200	     22mVerite V2200 based cards.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "v1000", "v2x00".

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chips. If the amount of memory is detected incorrectly, the actual
       amount of video memory should be specified with a 1mVideoRam 22mentry in the
       config file 1m"Device" 22msection.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disables use of the hardware cursor. Default: use HW-cursor.

       1mOption "OverclockMem" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Increases the Mem/Sys clock to 125MHz/60MHz from standard
	      110MHz/50MHz.  Default: Not overclocked.

       1mOption "DacSpeed" "4m22mMHz24m1m"0m
	      Run the memory at a higher clock. Useful on some cards with dis-
	      play glitches at higher resolutions. But adds the risk to damage
	      the hardware. Use with caution.

       1mOption "FramebufferWC" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      If writecombine is disabled in BIOS, and you add this option in
	      configuration file, then the driver will try to request write-
	      combined access to the framebuffer. This can drastically
	      increase the performance on unaccelerated server. Requires that
	      "MTRR"-support is compiled into the OS-kernel.  Default: Dis-
	      abled for V1000, enabled for V2100/V2200.

       1mOption "NoDDC" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable probing of DDC-information from your monitor. This
	      information is not used yet and is only there for informational
	      purposes. This might change before final XFree86 4.0 release.
	      Safe to disable if you experience problems during startup of X-
	      server.  Default: Probe DDC.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      If this option is enabled, the driver will cause the CPU to do
	      each drawing operation first into a shadow frame buffer in sys-
	      tem virtual memory and then copy the result into video memory.
	      If this option is not active, the CPU will draw directly into
	      video memory.  Enabling this option is beneficial for those sys-
	      tems where reading from video memory is, on average, slower than
	      the corresponding read/modify/write operation in system virtual
	      memory.  This is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters, and,
	      so, this option is enabled by default unless acceleration is
	      enabled.	Default: Enabled unless acceleration is used.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.	 This mode is
	      unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.



	      1mNotes  22mFor the moment the driver defaults to not request write-
	      combine for any chipset as there has been indications of prob-
	      lems with it. Use 1mOption "MTRR" 22mto let the driver request write-
	      combining of memory access on the video board.

       1mOption "HWCursor" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor.	Default: on.

       1mOption "SWCursor" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      Inverse of "HWCursor".  Default: off.


       The following display 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShadowFB" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      Use shadow framebuffer.  Disables HW acceleration.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "Rotate" "22mcw 1m| 22mccw1m"0m
	      Rotate the screen CW - clockwise or CCW - counter clockwise.
	      Disables HW Acceleration and HW Cursor, uses ShadowFB.  Default:
	      no rotation.

       1mOption "XVideo" ["22mboolean1m"]0m
	      Disable XVideo support by using the off option.  This changes
	      FIFO settings which prevent screen noise for high-res modes.
	      Default: on


       The following video memory 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "slow_edodram"0m
	      Switch the standard ViRGE to 2-cycle edo mode. Try this if you
	      encounter pixel corruption on the ViRGE. Using this option will
	      cause a large decrease in performance.  Default: off.

       1mOption "fpm_vram"0m
	      Switch the ViRGE/VX to fast page mode vram mode.	Default: off.

       1mOption "slow_dram 22m| 1mfast_dram"0m
	      Change Trio 3D and 3D/2X memory options.	Default: Use BIOS
	      defaults.

       1mOption "early_ras_precharge 22m| 1mlate_ras_precharge"0m
	      adjust memory parameters.	 One of these will us the same set-
	      tings as your video card defaults, and using neither in the con-
	      fig file does the same.  Default: none.

       1mOption "set_mclk" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      sets the memory clock, where 4minteger24m is in kHz, and 4minteger24m <=
	      100000.  Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at
	      server start.

       1mOption "set_refclk" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      sets the ref clock for ViRGE MX, where 4minteger24m is in kHz.
	      Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at server
	      start.



       The following acceleration and graphics engine 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "NoAccel"0m
	      Disable acceleration.  Very useful for determining if the driver
	      has problems with drawing and acceleration routines.  This is
	      the first option to try if your server runs but you see graphic
	      corruption on the screen.	 Using it decreases performance, as it
	      uses software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
	      can accelerate with hardware.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       1mOption "fifo_aggressive 22m| 1mfifo_moderate 22m| 1mfifo_conservative"0m
	      alter the settings for the threshold at which the pixel FIFO
	      takes over the internal memory bus to refill itself. The smaller
	      this threshold, the better the acceleration performance of the
	      card. You may try the fastest setting (1mfifo_aggressive22m) and move
	      down if you encounter pixel corruption.  The optimal setting
	      will probably depend on dot-clock and on color depth. Note that
	      specifying any of these options will also alter other memory
	      settings which may increase performance, so trying 1mfifo_conser-0m
	      1mvative 22mwill in most cases be a slight benefit (this uses the
	      chip defaults).  If pixel corruption or transient streaking is
	      observed during drawing operations then removing any fifo
	      options is recommended.  Default: none.


       The following PCI bus 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "pci_burst" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      will enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few
	      broken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "pci_retry" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      will allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program the ViRGE
	      registers.  1mpci_burst 22mmust be enabled for this to work.  This
	      will increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
	      because the driver does not have to poll the ViRGE before send-
	      ing it commands to make sure it is ready. It should work on most
	      recent PCI chipsets.  Default: off.

       The following ViRGE MX LCD 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "lcd_center"0m

       1mOption "set_lcdclk" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      allows setting the clock for a ViRGE MX LCD display.  4minteger24m is
	      in Hz.  Default: use probed value.


       The following additional 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShowCache" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory.	 A development
	      debug option.  Default: off.

       1mOption "mx_cr3a_fix" ["4m22mboolean24m1m"]0m
	      Enable or disable a cr3a fix added for ViRGE MX.	Default: on.

1mKNOWN BUGS0m
       The VideoRam generic driver parameter is presently ignored by the
       s3virge driver.	On PPC this is reported to cause problems for 2M
       cards, because they may autodetect as 4M.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      These two options interact to specify hardware or software cur-
	      sor.  If the SWCursor option is specified, any HWCursor setting
	      is ignored.  Thus, either "HWCursor off" or "SWCursor on" will
	      force the use of the software cursor.  On Savage/MX and Sav-
	      age/IX chips which are connected to LCDs, a software cursor will
	      be forced, because the Savage hardware cursor does not correctly
	      track the automatic panel expansion feature.  Default: hardware
	      cursor.

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the desktop 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
	      This option forces the ShadowFB option on, and disables acceler-
	      ation.  Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  This
	      option disables acceleration.  Default: off.

       1mOption "LCDClock" "4m22mfrequency24m1m"0m
	      Override the maximum dot clock.  Some LCD panels produce incor-
	      rect results if they are driven at too fast of a frequency.  If
	      UseBIOS is on, the BIOS will usually restrict the clock to the
	      correct range.  If not, it might be necessary to override it
	      here.  The 1mfrequency 22mparameter may be specified as an integer in
	      Hz (135750000), or with standard suffixes like "k", "kHz", "M",
	      or "MHz" (as in 135.75MHz).

       1mOption "UseBIOS" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the video BIOS to change modes.	Ordi-
	      narily, the 1msavage 22mdriver tries to use the video BIOS to do mode
	      switches.	 This generally produces the best results with the
	      mobile chips (/MX and /IX), since the BIOS knows how to handle
	      the critical but unusual timing requirements of the various LCD
	      panels supported by the chip.  To do this, the driver searches
	      through the BIOS mode list, looking for the mode which most
	      closely matches the XF86Config mode line.	 Some purists find
	      this scheme objectionable.  If you would rather have the 1msavage0m
	      driver use your mode line timing exactly, turn off the UseBios
	      option.  Default: on (use the BIOS).

       1mOption "ShadowStatus" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enables the use of a shadow status register.  There is a chip
	      bug in the Savage graphics engine that can cause a bus lock when
	      reading the engine status register under heavy load, such as
	      when scrolling text or dragging windows.	The bug affects about
	      4% of all Savage users.  If your system hangs regularly while
	      scrolling text or dragging windows, try turning this option on.
	      This uses an alternate method of reading the engine status which
	      is slightly more expensive, but avoids the problem.  Default:
	      off (use normal status register).

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1msiliconmotion 22mis an XFree86 driver for Silicon Motion based video
       cards.  The driver is fully accelerated, and provides support for the
       following framebuffer depths: 8, 16, and 24.  All visual types are sup-
       ported for depth 8, and TrueColor visuals are supported for the other
       depths.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1msiliconmotion 22mdriver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the
       following Silicon Motion chips:

       1mLynx	     22mSM910

       1mLynxE	     22mSM810

       1mLynx3DM     22mSM720

       1mCougar3DR   22mSM730

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.  All
       options names are case and white space insensitive when parsed by the
       server, for example,  "lynxe" and "LynxE" are equivalent.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following 1mChipSet0m
       names may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device" 22msection,
       and will override the auto-detection:

	   "lynx", "lynxe", "lynx3d", "lynxem", "lynxem+", "lynx3dm",
	   "cougar3dr".


       The following Cursor 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor.	Default: on.

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Inverse of "HWCursor".  Default: off.


       The following display 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Use shadow framebuffer.  Default: off.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the screen CW - clockwise or CCW - counter clockwise.
	      Uses ShadowFB.  Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "VideoKey" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the video color key.	Default: a little off full blue.

       1mOption "ByteSwap" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Turn on byte swapping for capturing using SMI demo board.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "Interlaced" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Turn on interlaced video capturing.  Default: off.

       1mOption "UseBIOS" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Use the BIOS to set the modes. This is used for custom panel
	      timings.	Default: on.

       1mOption "ZoomOnLCD" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Allow changing resolution on LCD (Ctrl-Alt-Plus and Ctrl-Alt-
	      Minus).  Default: off.


       The following video memory 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "set_mclk" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      sets the memory clock, where 4minteger24m is in kHz, and 4minteger24m <=
	      100000.  Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at
	      server start.



       The following acceleration and graphics engine 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "NoAccel"0m
	      Disable acceleration.  Very useful for determining if the driver
	      has problems with drawing and acceleration routines.  This is
	      the first option to try if your server runs but you see graphic
	      corruption on the screen.	 Using it decreases performance, as it
	      uses software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
	      can accelerate with hardware.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       1mOption "fifo_aggressive"0m

       1mOption "fifo_moderate"0m

       1mOption "fifo_conservative"0m
	      alter the settings for the threshold at which the pixel FIFO
	      takes over the internal memory bus to refill itself. The smaller
	      this threshold, the better the acceleration performance of the
	      card. You may try the fastest setting (1mfifo_aggressive22m) and move
	      down if you encounter pixel corruption.  The optimal setting
	      will probably depend on dot-clock and on color depth. Note that
	      specifying any of these options will also alter other memory
	      settings which may increase performance, so trying 1mfifo_conser-0m
	      1mvative 22mwill in most cases be a slight benefit (this uses the
	      chip defaults).  If pixel corruption or transient streaking is
	      observed during drawing operations then removing any fifo
	      options is recommended.  Default: none.


       The following PCI bus 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "pci_burst" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      will enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few
	      broken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance.  Default:
	      off.

       1mOption "pci_retry" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      will allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program the ViRGE
	      registers.  1mpci_burst 22mmust be enabled for this to work.  This
	      will increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
	      because the driver does not have to poll the ViRGE before send-
	      ing it commands to make sure it is ready. It should work on most
	      recent PCI chipsets.  Default: off.


       The following additional 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShowCache" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory.	 A development
	      debug option.  Default: off.

       4m1.24m 4mFor24m 4mall24m 4msupported24m 4mchipsets0m

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported on all chipsets:

       1mOption "NoAccel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable or enable 2D acceleration. Default: acceleration is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "HWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable the HW cursor. Default: HWCursor is on.

       1mOption "SWCursor" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      The opposite of HWCursor. Default: SWCursor is off.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CW"0m
	      Rotate the display clockwise. This mode is unaccelerated, and
	      uses the Shadow Frame Buffer layer. Using this option disables
	      the Resize and Rotate extension (RandR).	Default: no rotation.

       1mOption "Rotate" "CCW"0m
	      Rotate the display counterclockwise. This mode is unaccelerated,
	      and uses the Shadow Frame Buffer layer. Using this option dis-
	      ables the Resize and Rotate extension (RandR).  Default: no
	      rotation.

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      Shadow framebuffer is off.

       1mOption "CRT1Gamma" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable gamma correction.  Default: Gamma correction
	      is on.

       4m2.24m 4mOld24m 4mseries24m 4mspecific24m 4minformation0m

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       these chips, but in the case of the 6326, it will limit the memory size
       to 4MB. This is because the 6326's 2D engine can only address 4MB. The
       remaining memory seems to be intended for 3D texture data, since only
       the 3D engine can address RAM above 4MB. However, you can override this
       limitation using the 1m"VideoRAM" 22moption in the Device section if your
       board has more than 4MB and you need to use it. However, 2D accelera-
       tion, Xvideo and the HWCursor will be disabled in this case.

       The driver will also auto-detect the maximum dotclock and DAC speed.
       If you have problems getting high resolutions because of dot clock lim-
       itations, try using the 1m"DacSpeed" 22moption, also in the Device section.
       However, this is not recommended for the 6326. For this chip, the
       driver has two built-in modes for high resolutions which you should use
       instead. These are named 1m"SIS1280x1024-75" 22mand 1m"SIS1600x1200-60" 22mand
       they will be added to the list of default modes. To use these modes,
       just place them in your Screen section. Example:

       1mModes "SIS1600x1200-60" "SIS1280x1024x75" "1024x768" ...0m

       Of these modes, 1280x1024 is only available at 8, 15 and 16bpp.
       1600x1200 is available at 8bpp only.

       TV support for the 6326

       TV output is supported for the 6326. The driver will auto detect a TV
       connected and in this case add the following modes to the list of
       default modes: "PAL800x600", "PAL800x600U", "PAL720x540", "PAL640x480",
       "NTSC640x480", "NTSC640x480U" and "NTSC640x400".	 Use these modes like
       the hi-res modes described above.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported on the old series:

       1mOption "TurboQueue" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable TurboQueue mode.  Default: off for SIS530/620,
	      on for the others

       1mOption "FastVram" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable FastVram mode.	Enabling this sets the video
	      RAM timing to one cycle per read operation instead of two
	      cycles. Disabling this will set two cycles for read and write
	      operations. Leaving this option out uses the default, which
	      varies depending on the chipset.

       1mOption "NoHostBus" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      (SiS5597/5598 only). Disable CPU-to-VGA host bus support. This
	      speeds up CPU to video RAM transfers. Default: Host bus is
	      enabled.

       1mOption "NoXVideo" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable XV (XVideo) extension support. Default: XVideo is on.

       1mOption "NoYV12" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable YV12 Xv support. This might me required due to hardware
	      bugs in some chipsets. Disabling YV12 support forces Xv-aware
	      applications to use YUV2 or XShm for video output.  Default:
	      YV12 support is on.

       1mOption "TVStandard" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      (6326 only) Valid parameters are 1mPAL 22mor 1mNTSC.  22mThe default is
	      set by a jumper on the card.

       1mOption "TVXPosOffset" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      (6326 only) This option allows tuning the horizontal position of
	      the image for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0

       1mOption "TVYPosOffset" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      (6326 only) This option allows tuning the vertical position of
	      the image for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0

       1mOption "SIS6326TVEnableYFilter" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      (6326 only) This option allows enabling/disabling the Y (chroma)
	      filter for TV output.

       1mOption "SIS6326TVAntiFlicker" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      (6326 only) This option allow enabling/disabling the anti
	      flicker facility for TV output. Possible parameters are 1mOFF,0m
	      1mLOW, MED, HIGH 22mor 1mADAPTIVE.  22mBy experience, 1mADAPTIVE 22myields the
	      best results, hence it is the default.

       The 300 and 315/330 series feature two CRT controllers and very often
       come with a video bridge for controlling LCD and TV output. Here-
       inafter, the term 1mCRT1 22mrefers to the VGA output of the chip, and 1mCRT20m
       refers to either LCD, TV or secondary VGA. Due to timing reasons, only
       one CRT2 output can be active at the same time. But this limitation
       does not apply to using CRT1 and CRT2 at the same time which makes it
       possible to run the driver in dual head mode.

       The driver supports the following video bridges:

       1mSiS301 SiS301B(-DH) SiS301C SiS301LV SiS302(E)LV0m

       Instead of a video bridge, some machines have a 1mLVDS 22mtransmitter to
       control LCD panels, and a 1mChrontel 7005 22mor 1m7019 22mfor TV output. All
       these are supported as well.

       About TV output

       On the SiS301 and the Chrontel 7005, only resolutions up to 800x600 are
       supported. On all others, resolutions up to 1024x768 are supported.
       However, due to a hardware bug, Xvideo might be distorted on SiS video
       bridges if running NTSC or PAL-M at 1024x768.

       About XVideo support

       XVideo is supported on all chipsets of both families. However, there
       are some differences in hardware features which cause limitations.  The
       300 series as well as the SiS55x, M650, 651, 661FX, M661FX, and 741
       support two video overlays. The SiS315/H/PRO, 650/740 and 330 support
       only one such overlay. On chips with two overlays, one overlay is used
       for CRT1, the other for CRT2. On the other chipsets, the option 1m"XvOn-0m
       1mCRT2" 22mcan be used to select the desired output channel.

       About Merged Framebuffer support

       This mode is strongly recommended over Xinerama. Please see
       http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed information.

       About dual-head support

       Dual head mode has some limitations as regards color depth and resolu-
       tion. Due to memory bandwidth limits, CRT1 might have a reduced maximum
       refresh rate if running on higher resolutions than 1280x1024.

       Colordepth 8 is not supported when running in dual head mode.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported on the 300 and 315/330
       series:

       1mOption "NoXVideo" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Disable XV (XVideo) extension support.  Default: XVideo is on.

       1mOption "XvOnCRT2" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      On chipsets with only one video overlay, this option can used to
	      bind the overlay to CRT1 ( if a monitor is detected and if this
	      option is either unset or set to 1mfalse 22m) or CRT2 ( if a CRT2
	      device is detected or forced, and if this option is set to 1mtrue0m
	      ). If either only CRT1 or CRT2 is detected, the driver decides
	      automatically. In Merged Framebuffer mode, this option is
	      ignored.	Default: overlay is used on CRT1

       1mOption "ForceCRT1" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Force CRT1 to be on of off. If a monitor is connected, it will
	      be detected during server start. However, some old monitors are
	      not detected correctly. In such cases, you may set this option
	      to 1mon 22min order to make the driver initialize CRT1 anyway.  If
	      this option is set to 1moff 22m, the driver will switch off CRT1.
	      Default: auto-detect

       1mOption "ForceCRT2Type" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Force display type to one of: 1mNONE 22m, 1mTV 22m, 1mSVIDEO 22m, 1mCOMPOSITE 22m,
	      1mSVIDEO+COMPOSITE 22m, 1mSCART 22m, 1mLCD 22m, 1mVGA 22m; 1mNONE 22mwill disable CRT2.
	      The SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SVIDEO+COMPOSITE and SCART parameters are
	      for SiS video bridges only and can be used to force the driver
	      to use a specific TV output connector (if present).  Default:
	      auto detect.

       1mOption "CRT2Gamma" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable gamma correction for CRT2. Only supported for
	      SiS video bridges. Default: Gamma correction for CRT2 is on.

       1mOption "TVStandard" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Force the TV standard to either 1mPAL 22mor 1mNTSC.  22mOn some machines
	      with 630, 730 and the 315/330 series, 1mPALM 22m, 1mPALN 22mand 1mNTSCJ 22mare
	      supported as well. Default: BIOS setting.

       1mOption "TVXPosOffset" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option allows tuning the horizontal position of the image
	      for TV output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the
	      Chrontel 7019. Default: 0

       1mOption "TVYPosOffset" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option allows tuning the vertical position of the image for
	      TV output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the
	      Chrontel 7019. Default: 0

       1mOption "SISTVXScale" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option selects the horizontal zooming level for TV output.
	      The range is from -16 to 16. Only supported on SiS video
	      bridges. Default: 0

       1mOption "SISTVYScale" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option selects the vertical zooming level for TV output in
	      the following modes: 640x480, 800x600. On the 315/330 series,
	      also 720x480, 720x576 and 768x576. The range is from -4 to 3.
	      Only supported on SiS video bridges. Default: 0

       1mOption "CHTVOverscan" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      On machines with a Chrontel TV encoder, this can be used to
	      force the TV mode to overscan or underscan.  1mon 22mmeans overscan,
	      1moff 22mmeans underscan.	 Default: BIOS setting.

       1mOption "CHTVSuperOverscan" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      On machines with a Chrontel 7005 TV encoder, this option enables
	      a super-overscan mode. This is only supported if the TV standard
	      is PAL. Super overscan will produce an image on the TV which is
	      larger than the viewable area.

       The driver supports many more options. Please see http://www.winis-
       chhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for more information.

       DRI is supported on the 300 series only. On Linux, DRI requires the
       kernel's SiS framebuffer driver ( 1msisfb 22m) and some other modules which
       come with either the kernel or the X server.

       Sisfb takes care of memory management for texture data. In order to
       prevent the X Server and sisfb from overwriting each other's data,
       sisfb reserves an amount of video memory for the X driver. This amount
       can either be selected using sisfb's mem parameter, or auto-selected
       depending on the amount of total video RAM available.

       Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as a complete frame-
       buffer driver. If you start sisfb with a valid mode (ie you gain a
       graphical console), the X driver can communicate with sisfb and doesn't
       require any manual configuration for finding out about the video memory
       it is allowed to use.  However, if you are running a 2.4 series Linux
       kernel and use sisfb for video memory management only, ie you started
       sisfb with mode=none and still have a text mode console, there is no
       communication between sisfb and the X driver. For this purpose, the

       1mOption "MaxXFBMem" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m

       exists. This option must be set to the same value as given to sisfb
       through its "mem" parameter, ie the amount of memory to use for X in
       kilobytes.

       If you started sisfb without the mem argument, sisfb will reserve

       12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available,

       8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available,

       4096KB in all other cases.

       If you intend to use DRI, I recommend setting the total video memory in
       the BIOS to 64MB in order to at least overcome the lack of memory swap
       functions.

       1mOption "DRI" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This option allows enabling or disabling DRI. By default, DRI is
	      on.

       1mOption "AGPSize" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      This option allows selecting the amount of AGP memory to be used
	      for DRI.	The amount is to be specified in megabyte, the default
	      is 8.

1mKNOWN BUGS0m
       none.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mvesa 22mis an XFree86 driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive
       most VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the basic stan-
       dard VESA core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports
       depths 8, 15 16 and 24.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mvesa 22mdriver supports most VESA-compatible video cards.	There are
       some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the presence of VESA-compatible hardware.  The
       1mChipSet 22mname may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device"0m
       section, and will override the auto-detection:

	   "vesa"

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      on.

	      This option is recommended for performance reasons.

       1mOption "VBEBigEndian" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      This 1mOption 22mis only acted upon on big-endian systems.  Normally,
	      the driver will disallow colour depths and framebuffer bpp's
	      that cannot be supported through simple byte-swapping of pixels.
	      This option exists to override this behaviour should the
	      adapter's BIOS be intelligent enough to detect host endianness.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mvga 22mis an XFree86 driver for generic VGA video cards.  It can drive
       most VGA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the basic stan-
       dard VGA core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports
       depths 1, 4 and 8.  All relevant visual types are supported at each
       depth.  Multi-head configurations are supported in combination with
       some other drivers, but only when the 1mvga 22mdriver is driving the primary
       head.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       The 1mvga 22mdriver supports most VGA-compatible video cards.  There are
       some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details.	 This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the presence of VGA-compatible hardware.	 The
       1mChipSet 22mname may optionally be specified in the config file 1m"Device"0m
       section, and will override the auto-detection:

	   "generic"

       The driver will only use 64k of video memory for depth 1 and depth 8
       operation, and 256k of video memory for depth 4 (this is the standard
       VGA limit).

       When operating at depth 8, only a single built-in 320x200 video mode is
       available.  At other depths there is more flexibility regarding mode
       choice.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "ShadowFB" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
	      off.

	      This option is recommended for performance reasons when running
	      at depths 1 and 4, especially when using modern PCI-based hard-
	      ware.  It is required when using those depths in a multi-head
	      configuration where one or more of the other screens is operat-
	      ing at a different depth.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mkbd_mode 22m[ -a -u ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mKbd_mode24m resets the PC console keyboard to a rational state.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options are supported:

       1m-a	 22mSet the keyboard so that ASCII characters are read from the
	       console.

       1m-u	 22mSet the keyboard so that undecoded keyboard values are read
	       from the console.

1mEXAMPLES0m
       If the server crashes or otherwise fails to put the keyboard back in
       ascii mode when it exits, it can leave your keyboard dead.  If you are
       able to login remotely, you can reset it typing:

	    kbd_mode -a


       Conversely, changing the keyboard to ascii mode while the server is
       running will make the keyboard appear to be dead while the the mouse
       continues to work.  Again, if you are able to login remotely, you can
       reset it typing:

	    kbd_mode -u

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-l	 22mProbe the PCI buses and print a line for each detected device.
	       Each line contains the bus location (bus:device:function), chip
	       vendor/device, card (subsystem) vendor/card, revision, class
	       and header type.	 All values printed are in hexadecimal.

       1m-r 4m22mPCI-ID0m
	       Read the PCI configuration space register at 4moffset24m for the PCI
	       device at bus location 4mPCI-ID24m.  4mPCI-ID24m should be given in the
	       form bus:device:function, with each value in hexadecimal.  By
	       default, a 32-bit register is read.

       4mScanpci24m is a utility that can be used to scan PCI buses and report
       information about the configuration space settings for each PCI device.
       On most platforms, 4mscanpci24m can only be run by the root user.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-v	 22mPrint the configuration space information for each device in a
	       verbose format.	Without this option, only a brief description
	       is printed for each device.

       1m-x	 22mShow hexadecimal dump of the first 64 bytes of each PCI
	       device's configuration space.  For CardBus bridges, the first
	       128 bytes are dumped instead.  This option can be repeated to
	       dump all 256 or 4096 bytes, but doing so might cause 1mscanpci0m
	       (or the system) to crash because some devices cannot tolerate
	       reads of undefined portions of their configuration space.

       1m-1	 22mUse PCI config type 1.

       1m-2	 22mUse PCI config type 2.

       1m-f	 22mUsed in conjunction with the above two options, this forces the
	       specified configuration type to be used for config space
	       access.

       1m-O	 22mUse the OS's PCI config space access mechanism to access the
	       PCI config space (when available).

       1m-V 4m22mn24m	 Set the verbosity level to 4mn24m for the internal PCI scanner.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mcalcomp 22mis an XFree86 input driver for Calcomp devices.

       The 1mcalcomp 22mdriver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
       as the X server's core pointer.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       This driver supports the Calcomp binary format used by the Drawing
       Board II and III series.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.	 This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       Both the 3 button stylus and the 4- or 16 button lens cursors can be
       used without changing the configuration file. Support for pressure sen-
       sitivity has not been tested, so the solid-tip stylus will probably not
       work.

       This device supports the following entries:

	       1mOption 4m22m"Device"24m 4m"path"0m
		   sets the path to the special file which represents the
		   serial line where the tablet is plugged. This option is
		   mandatory.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Cursor"24m 4m"Stylus"|"Puck"0m
		   this option is supported for backward compatibility only,
		   but it should not be necessary.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DeviceName"24m 4m"name"0m
		   sets the name of the X device. Some user-space programs may
		   require a fixed name, e.g. TABLET,  to recognize the digi-
		   tizer.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Mode"24m 4m"Relative"|"Absolute"0m
		   sets the mode of the device. Currently only Absolute mode
		   is supported.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Pressure"24m 4m"on"0m
		   enables pressure reporting if your tablet supports it. This
		   option is untested and may not work.

	       1mOption 4m22m"AlwaysCore"24m 4m"on"0m
		   enables the sharing of the core pointer. When this feature
		   is enabled, the device will take control of the core
		   pointer (and thus will emit core events) and at the same
		   time will be able, when asked so, to report extended
		   events.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MinX"24m 4m"number"0m
		   X coordinate of the bottom left corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MinY"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Y coordinate of the bottom left corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MaxX"24m 4m"Inumber"0m
		   X coordinate of the top right corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MaxY"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Y coordinate of the top right corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DebugLevel"24m 4mnumber0m
		   sets the level of debugging info reported.

       covers configuration details specific to this driver.  For better
       understanding please read also the 1mCTS 22mand various 1mIRT 22mmanuals which
       are available in "pdf" format from Citron web page 1mwww.citron.de 22mor
       directly from Citron.



       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "Device" "4m22mdevpath24m1m"0m
	      Specify the device path for the citron touch.  Valid devices
	      are:

		   /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, ....	 This option is mandatory.

	      It's important to specify the right device Note: com1 ->
	      /dev/ttyS0, com2 -> /dev/ttyS1 ....


       1mOption "ScreenNumber" "4m22mscreennumber24m1m"0m
	      sets the 4mscreennumber24m for the 4mcitron24m InputDevice.

	      4mDefault:24m ScreenNumber: "0"


       1mOption "MinX, MinY" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      These are the minimum X and Y values for the 4mcitron24m input
	      device.

	      Note: MinX, MinY must be less than MaxX, MaxY.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "65535"

	      4mDefault:24m MinX: "0"  MinY: "0"



       1mOption "MaxX, MaxY" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      These are the maximum X and Y values for the 4mcitron24m input
	      device.

	      Note: MaxX, MaxY must be greater than MinX, MinY.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "65535"

	      4mDefault:24m MaxX: "65535"  MaxY: "65535"



       1mOption "ButtonNumber" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4mbutton24m 4mnumber24m that is returned
	      within the xf86PostButton event message

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "255"

	      4mDefault:24m "1"


       1mOption "ButtonThreshold" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4mbutton24m 4mthreshold.24m  It changes
	      the pressure sensitivity of the touch. A higher number corre-
	      sponds to a higher pressure.

	      Note: This feature is only available with pressure sensitive
	      hardware.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "255"

	      4mDefault:24m "20"


       1mSleep-Mode0m
	      If the IRT is in 4mDoze-Mode24m and Touch Zone is not interrupted for
	      another certain span of time, the so-called 4mSleep-Mode24m is acti-
	      vated. The 4mSleep-Mode24m decreases the scan rate of the beams even
	      further than the 4mDoze-Mode24m does (see below). This way the life
	      expectancy of the beams is prolonged and the power consumption
	      of the IRT is reduced.  As soon as an interruption of the Touch
	      Zone is detected, the 4mSleep-Mode24m is deactivated and the Touch
	      Zone will again be scanned with the maximum speed. With the
	      Sleep-Mode activated, depending on the set scan rate the IRT's
	      response time can be considerably longer as in normal operation.
	      If, for example, a scan rate of 500 ms / scan is set, it may
	      last up to a half of a second until the IRT detects the inter-
	      ruption and deactivates the 4mSleep-Mode.0m



       1mOption "SleepMode" "4m22mmode24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4msleep-mode24m of the touch.
	      Determines the behaviour of the Sleep-Mode.

	      1m0x000m
	       No message at either activation or deactivation

	      1m0x010m
	       Message at activation

	      1m0x020m
	       Message at deactivation

	      1m0x030m
	       Message at activation and deactivation

	      1m0x10 22mGP_OUT output set according to the Sleep-Mode status

	      4mValues:24m "0" "1" "2" "3" "16"

	      4mDefault:24m "0"


       1mOption "SleepTime" "4m22mtime24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4msleep-time24m of the touch. It is
	      the activation time in seconds ("0" = immediately activated,
	      "65535" = always deactivated).

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "65535" [s]

	      4mDefault:24m "65535" => deactivated


       1mOption "SleepScan" "4m22mscan24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4mscan-time24m of the touch. This
	      is the time interval between two scan operations while in Sleep-
	      Mode. The time interval is set in steps of milliseconds.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "65535" [ms]

	      4mDefault:24m "500"


       1mOption "PWMAdjSrc" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m

       1mOption "PWMAdjDst" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      These parameters are used to adjust the brightness of different
	      backlight inverters. At the moment 2 backlight inverters are
	      used: 0=TDK  1=AC. If you want a AC backlight inverter to behave
	      like an AC type you have to set 4mPWMAdjSrc24m to 0 (TDK) and 4mPWMAd-0m
	      4mjDst24m to 1 (AC).

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "1"

	      4mDefault:24m "-1" (no adjustment)


       1mOption "PWMActive" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value determines the mark-to-space ratio of the 4mPWM24m output
	      while in normal operation (sleep-mode not active).  Higher val-
	      ues result in longer pulse widths. This output signal can be
	      used in conjunction with the 4mCitron24m 4mAWBI24m to do backlight-dimming
	      via the touch.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "255"

	      4mDefault:24m "255" (max. brightness)


       1mOption "PWMSleep" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value determines the mark-to-space ratio of the 4mPWM24m output
	      while in sleep-mode (-> 4mSleepMode,24m 4mSleepScan,24m 4mSleepTime24m ) opera-
	      tion (sleep-mode active).	 Higher values result in longer pulse
	      widths.

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "255"

	      4mDefault:24m "255" (max. brightness)


       1mOption "PWMFreq" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value determines the 4mPWM24m frequency in Hertz

	      4mRange:24m "39" - "9803"

	      4mDefault:24m "9803" (max. frequency)


       1mOption "ClickMode" "4m22mmode24m1m"0m
	      With mode one can select between 5 4mClickModes0m

	      4m"1"24m 4m=24m 4mClickMode24m 4mEnter0m

	      With this mode every interruption of the infrared beams will
	      activate a ButtonPress event and after the interruption a But-
	      tonRelease event will be sent.

	      4m"2"24m 4m=24m 4mClickMode24m 4mDual0m

	      With this mode every interruption will sent a Proximity event
	      and every second interruption a ButtonPress event. With the
	      release of the interruption (while one interruption is still
	      active) a ButtonRelease event will be sent.

	      4m"3"24m 4m=24m 4mClickMode24m 4mDual24m 4mExit0m

	      With this mode every interruption will sent a ProximityIn event
	      and every second interruption a ButtonPress event. With the
	      release of the interruption (while one interruption is still
	      active) no ButtonRelease event will be sent. Only if all inter-
	      ruptions are released a ButtonRelease followed by a ProximityOut
	      event will be sent.

	      4m"4"24m 4m=24m 4mClickMode24m 4mZPress0m

	      With this mode every interruption will sent a ProximityIn event.
	      Only if a certain pressure is exceeded a ButtonPress event will
	      occur. If the pressure falls below a certain limit a ButtonRe-
	      lease event will be sent.	 After also the interruption is
	      released a ProximityOut event is generated.

	      4m"5"24m 4m=24m 4mClickMode24m 4mZPress24m 4mExit0m

	      This mode is similar to "Clickmode Dual Exit".  The first inter-
	      ruption of the beams will sent a ProximityIn event. Only if a
	      certain pressure is exceeded a ButtonPress event will occur. If
	      the pressure falls below a certain limit no ButtonRelease event
	      will be sent.  After the interruption is also released a Button-
	      Release followed by a ProximityOut event is generated.

	      4mRange:24m "1" - "5"

	      4mDefault:24m "1" (ClickMode Enter)


       1mOption "Origin" "4m22mvalue24m1m"0m
	      This value sets the coordinates origin to one of the four cor-
	      ners of the screen.  The following values are accepted: "0"

	      4mRange:24m "0" - "3"

	      4mDefault:24m "0" (TOPLEFT)


       1mDoze-Mode0m
	      If for a certain span of time the Touch Zone is not interrupted,
	      the so-called Doze-Mode is automatically activated. The acti-
	      vated Doze-Mode slightly decreases the scan rate of the beams.
	      This way the power consumption of the IRT is reduced. As soon as
	      an interruption of the Touch Zone is detected, the Doze-Mode is
	      deactivated and the Touch Zone will again be scanned with the
	      maximum speed.


       1mOption "DozeMode" "4m22mmode24m1m"0m
	      This value is responsible for the 4mdoze-mode24m of the touch.

	      Determines the behaviour of the Doze-Mode.

	      0x00 No message at either activation or deactivation

	      0x01 Message at activation

	      0x02 Message at deactivation

	      0x03 Message at activation and deactivation

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mfpit 22mis an XFree86 input driver for Fujitsu Stylistic Tablet PCs.

       The 1mfpit 22mdriver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used as
       the X server's core pointer.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       This driver supports the touchscreen of the Stylistic LT and (with spe-
       cial options) of the Stylistic 500, 1000 and 2300.

       Under Linux the Fujitsus serial port is not, by default, detected.
       Therefore the following must be added to one of your start-up scripts.
       (Either one of the X scripts, or to rc.local or similar).


       1msetserial /dev/ttyS3 autoconfig0m

       1msetserial /dev/ttyS3 IRQ 15 baud_base 115200 port 0xfce80m

       This driver now supports Stylistic 3400 (and possibly other passive-pen
       systems) with a special 4m"Passive"24m paramter. Try this serial configura-
       tion for the 3400:


       1msetserial /dev/ttyS3 autoconfig0m

       1msetserial /dev/ttyS3 uart 16450 irq 5 port 0xfd680m


1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5x) for general configuration details and
       for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The device supports the following options:

	       1mOption 4m22m"MaximumXPosition"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Sets the maximum X position, use this to callibrate your
		   touchscreen's right hand edge.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MinimumXPosition"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Sets the minimum X position, use this to callibrate your
		   touchscreen's left hand edge.

	       1mOption 4m22m"MaximumYPosition"24m 4m"number"0m

	       1mOption 4m22m"MinimumYPosition"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Same as for X axis, but for Y axis.

	       1mOption 4m22m"InvertX"0m

	       1mOption 4m22m"InvertY"0m
		   Invert the specified axis.

	       1mOption 4m22m"SwapXY"0m
		   Swap the X and Y axis.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Rotate"24m 4m"CW"0m
		   1mOption 4m22m"Rotate"24m 4m"CWW"24m Manipulate the invert and swap
		   options to match screen rotations.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DeviceName"24m 4m"name"0m
		   1mOption 4m22m"DeviceName"24m 4m"name"24m sets the name of the X device.

	       1mOption 4m22m"AlwaysCore"24m 4m"on"0m
		   enables the sharing of the core pointer. When this feature
		   is enabled, the device will take control of the core
		   pointer (and thus will emit core events) and at the same
		   time will be able, when asked so, to report extended
		   events.  You can use the last available integer feedback to
		   control this feature. When the value of the feedback is
		   zero, the feature is disabled. The feature is enabled for
		   any other value.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DebugLevel"24m 4mnumber0m
		   sets the level of debugging info reported.

	       1mOption 4m22m"BaudRate"24m 4m"38400"24m1m, 4m22m"19200"24m 1mor 4m22m"9600"24m 1m(default)0m
		   changes the serial link speed.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Passive"0m
		   decodes the passive pen.

       Example, for Stylistic LT setup is:
       1mSection "InputDevice"0m
	 1mIdentifier "4m22mmouse024m1m"0m
	 1mDriver "fpit"0m
	 1mOption "Device"   "4m22m/dev/ttyS324m1m"0m
       1mEndSection0m

       And for other Stylistic devices try:
       1mSection "InputDevice"0m
	 1mIdentifier "4m22mmouse024m1m"0m
	 1mDriver "fpit"0m
	 1mOption "Device"   "4m22m/dev/ttyS324m1m"0m

		   sets the minimum and maximum values returned for the abso-
		   lute X,Y axis of the pen tablet. These values default to
		   0-8000 for X and 0-6000 for Y. It should generally be safe
		   to leave these values untouched.

	       1mOption 4m22m"PressMin24m 4m"int"0m

	       1mOption 4m22m"PressMax24m 4m"int"0m
		   sets the minimum and maximum values returned for the pres-
		   sure sensitive tip. These values default to 0-127. It
		   should generally be safe to leave these values untouched.

	       1mOption 4m22m"PressDiv"24m 4m"int"0m
		   sets the divider for the returned pressure value. This
		   option will allow you to return a smaller set of values for
		   the pressure sensitive tip allowing for finer control. The
		   returned value is computed as follows:

		   4mX24m 4m/24m 4mPressDiv24m 4m=24m 4mreturned24m 4mvalue0m
			  where X equals the value read from the tablet.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mkbd 22mis an XFree86 input driver for keyboards.  The driver supports the
       standard OS-provided keyboard interface, but these are currently only
       available to this driver module for Linux and BSD.  This driver is
       experimental, but will soon replace the built-in 1mkeyboard 22mdriver.

       The 1mkbd 22mdriver functions as a keyboard input device, and may be used as
       the X server's core keyboard.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.	 This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "Device" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Specify the keyboard device.  Default: the OS's default console
	      keyboard input source.

       1mOption "Protocol" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Specify the keyboard protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

		   Standard, Xqueue.

	      Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.	 Default:
	      "Standard".

       1mOption "AutoRepeat" "4m22mdelay24m 4mrate24m1m"0m
	      sets the auto repeat behaviour for the keyboard.	This is not
	      implemented on all platforms.  4mdelay24m is the time in milliseconds
	      before a key starts repeating.  4mrate24m is the number of times a
	      key repeats per second.  Default: "500 30".

       1mOption "XLeds" "4m22mledlist24m1m"0m
	      makes the keyboard LEDs specified in 4mledlist24m available for
	      client use instead of their traditional function (Scroll Lock,
	      Caps Lock and Num Lock).	The numbers in the list are in the
	      range 1 to 3.  Default: empty list.

       1mOption "XkbRules" "4m22mrules24m1m"0m
	      specifies which XKB rules file to use for interpreting the 1mXkb-0m
	      1mModel22m, 1mXkbLayout22m, 1mXkbVariant22m, and 1mXkbOptions 22msettings.  Default:
	      "xfree86" for most platforms, but "xfree98" for the Japanese
	      PC-98 platforms.

       1mOption "XkbModel" "4m22mmodelname24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: "pc101" for
	      most platforms, but "pc98" for the Japanese PC-98 platforms, and
	      "pc101_sol8x86" for Solaris 8 on x86.

       1mOption "XkbLayout" "4m22mlayoutname24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard layout name.  This is usually the
	      country or language type of the keyboard.	 Default: "us" for
	      most platforms, but "nec/jp" for the Japanese PC-98 platforms.

       1mOption "XkbVariant" "4m22mvariants24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard variant components.  These can be
	      used to enhance the keyboard layout details.  Default: not set.

       1mOption "XkbOptions" "4m22moptions24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard option components.  These can be used
	      to enhance the keyboard behaviour.  Default: not set.

       Some other XKB-related options are available, but they are incompatible
       with the ones listed above and are not recommended, so they are not
       documented here.

	      PC-98 platforms.

       1mOption "XkbModel" "4m22mmodelname24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: "pc101" for
	      most platforms, but "pc98" for the Japanese PC-98 platforms, and
	      "pc101_sol8x86" for Solaris 8 on x86.

       1mOption "XkbLayout" "4m22mlayoutname24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard layout name.  This is usually the
	      country or language type of the keyboard.	 Default: "us" for
	      most platforms, but "nec/jp" for the Japanese PC-98 platforms.

       1mOption "XkbVariant" "4m22mvariants24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard variant components.  These can be
	      used to enhance the keyboard layout details.  Default: not set.

       1mOption "XkbOptions" "4m22moptions24m1m"0m
	      specifies the XKB keyboard option components.  These can be used
	      to enhance the keyboard behaviour.  Default: not set.

       Some other XKB-related options are available, but they are incompatible
       with the ones listed above and are not recommended, so they are not
       documented here.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mmouse 22mis an XFree86 input driver for mice.	The driver supports most
       available mouse types and interfaces.  USB mice are only supported on
       some OSs, and the level of support for PS/2 mice depends on the OS.

       The 1mmouse 22mdriver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
       as the X server's core pointer.	Multiple mice are supported by multi-
       ple instances of this driver.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       There is a detailed list of hardware that the 1mmouse 22mdriver supports in
       the 4mREADME.mouse24m document.	This can be found in
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/, or online at http://www.xfree86.org/cur-
       rent/mouse.html.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.	 This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver can auto-detect the mouse type on some platforms  On some
       platforms this is limited to plug and play serial mice, and on some the
       auto-detection works for any mouse that the OS's kernel driver sup-
       ports.  On others, it is always necessary to specify the mouse protocol
       in the config file.  The 4mREADME.mouse24m document contains some detailed
       information about this.

       The following driver 1mOptions 22mare supported:

       1mOption "Protocol" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Specify the mouse protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

		   Auto, Microsoft, MouseSystems, MMSeries, Logitech, Mouse-
		   Man, MMHitTab, GlidePoint, IntelliMouse, ThinkingMouse,
		   ValuMouseScroll, AceCad, PS/2, ImPS/2, ExplorerPS/2, Think-
		   ingMousePS/2, MouseManPlusPS/2, GlidePointPS/2, Net-
		   MousePS/2, NetScrollPS/2, BusMouse, SysMouse, WSMouse, USB,
		   Xqueue.

	      Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.	 The "Auto"
	      platform specifies that protocol auto-detection should be
	      attempted.  There is no default protocol setting, and specifying
	      this option is mandatory.

       1mOption "Device" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Specifies the device through which the mouse can be accessed.  A
	      common setting is "/dev/mouse", which is often a symbolic link
	      to the real device.  This option is mandatory, and there is no
	      default setting.

       1mOption "Buttons" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Specifies the number of mouse buttons.  In cases where the num-
	      ber of buttons cannot be auto-detected, the default value is 3.
	      The maximum value is 24.

       1mOption "Emulate3Buttons" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable the emulation of the third (middle) mouse button
	      for mice which only have two physical buttons.  The third button
	      is emulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously.  Default:
	      off

       1mOption "Emulate3Timeout" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) that the driver waits before
	      deciding if two buttons where pressed "simultaneously" when 3
	      button emulation is enabled.  Default: 50.

       1mOption "ChordMiddle" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable handling of mice that send left+right events when
	      the middle button is used.  Default: off.

       1mOption "EmulateWheel" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable "wheel" emulation.	 Wheel emulation means emulat-
	      ing button press/release events when the mouse is moved while a
	      specific real button is pressed.	Wheel button events (typically
	      buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for scrolling.	Wheel emula-
	      tion is useful for getting wheel-like behaviour with trackballs.
	      It can also be useful for mice with 4 or more buttons but no
	      wheel.  See the description of the 1mEmulateWheelButton22m, 1mEmulate-0m
	      1mWheelInertia22m, 1mXAxisMapping22m, and 1mYAxisMapping 22moptions below.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "EmulateWheelButton" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Specifies which button must be held down to enable wheel emula-
	      tion mode.  While this button is down, X and/or Y pointer move-
	      ment will generate button press/release events as specified for
	      the 1mXAxisMapping 22mand 1mYAxisMapping 22msettings.  Default: 4.

       1mOption "EmulateWheelInertia" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Specifies how far (in pixels) the pointer must move to generate
	      button press/release events in wheel emulation mode.  Default:
	      50.

       1mOption "XAxisMapping" "4m22mN124m 4mN224m1m"0m
	      Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the X direction
	      in wheel emulation mode.	Button number 4mN124m is mapped to the neg-
	      ative X axis motion and button number 4mN224m is mapped to the posi-
	      tive X axis motion.  Default: no mapping.

       1mOption "YAxisMapping" "4m22mN124m 4mN224m1m"0m
	      Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the Y direction
	      in wheel emulation mode.	Button number 4mN124m is mapped to the neg-
	      ative Y axis motion and button number 4mN224m is mapped to the posi-
	      tive Y axis motion.  Default: "4 5".

       1mOption "ZAxisMapping" "X"0m

       1mOption "ZAxisMapping" "Y"0m

       1mOption "ZAxisMapping" "4m22mN124m 4mN224m1m"0m

       1mOption "ZAxisMapping" "4m22mN124m 4mN224m 4mN324m 4mN424m1m"0m
	      Set the mapping for the Z axis (wheel) motion to buttons or
	      another axis (1mX 22mor 1mY22m).	Button number 4mN124m is mapped to the nega-
	      tive Z axis motion and button number 4mN224m is mapped to the posi-
	      tive Z axis motion.  For mice with two wheels, four button num-
	      bers can be specified, with the negative and positive motion of
	      the second wheel mapped respectively to buttons number 4mN324m and
	      4mN424m.	Default: no mapping.

       1mOption "FlipXY" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable swapping the X and Y axes.	 This transformation
	      is applied after the 1mInvX22m, 1mInvY 22mand 1mAngleOffset 22mtransformations.
	      Default: off.

       1mOption "InvX" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Invert the X axis.  Default: off.

       1mOption "InvY" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Invert the Y axis.  Default: off.

       1mOption "AngleOffset" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Specify a clockwise angular offset (in degrees) to apply to the
	      pointer motion.  This transformation is applied before the
	      1mFlipXY22m, 1mInvX 22mand 1mInvY 22mtransformations.  Default: 0.

       1mOption "SampleRate" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Sets the number of motion/button events the mouse sends per sec-
	      ond.  Setting this is only supported for some mice, including
	      some Logitech mice and some PS/2 mice on some platforms.
	      Default: whatever the mouse is already set to.

       1mOption "Resolution" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Sets the resolution of the device in counts per inch.  Setting
	      this is only supported for some mice, including some PS/2 mice
	      on some platforms.  Default: whatever the mouse is already set
	      to.

       1mOption "DragLockButtons" "4m22mL124m 4mB224m 4mL324m 4mB424m1m"0m
	      Sets "drag lock buttons" that simulate holding a button down, so
	      that low dexterity people do not have to hold a button down at
	      the same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur in
	      pairs, with the lock button number occurring first, followed by
	      the button number that is the target of the lock button.

       1mOption "DragLockButtons" "4m22mM124m1m"0m
	      Sets a "master drag lock button" that acts as a "Meta Key" indi-
	      cating that the next button pressed is to be "drag locked".

       1mOption "ClearDTR" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable clearing the DTR line on the serial port used by
	      the mouse.  Some dual-protocol mice require the DTR line to be
	      cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.  This option is
	      for serial mice only.  Default: off.

       1mOption "ClearRTS" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Enable/disable clearing the RTS line on the serial port used by
	      the mouse.  Some dual-protocol mice require the RTS line to be
	      cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.  This option is
	      for serial mice only.  Default: off.

       1mOption "BaudRate" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the baud rate to use for communicating with a serial mouse.
	      This option should rarely be required because the default is
	      correct for almost all situations.  Valid values include: 300,
	      1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200.  Default: 1200.

       There are some other options that may be used to control various param-
       eters for serial port communication, but they are not documented here
       because the driver sets them correctly for each mouse protocol type.

       1mOption "MinX" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the left hand X value from the touchscreen, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxX" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the right hand X value from the touchscreen, for calibra-
	      tion.

       1mOption "MinY" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the top Y value from the touchscreen, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxY" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the bottom Y value from the touchscreen, for calibration.

       1mOption "Screen" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      The screen to attach to the touchscreen when running with multi-
	      ple screens.  The default is screen 0.

       1mOption "Device" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      The serial port that is attached to the touchscreen interface.
	      On the Palmax PD1000 and PD1100 this is ttyS0.

       1mOption "DeviceName" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the X11 device name for the touchscreen. This defaults to
	      TOUCHSCREEN.

       1mOption "PortraitMode" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the display orientation. The default is "landscape" but you
	      can rotate the screen clockwise ("portrait") or anticlockwise
	      ("portraitCCW").

       1mOption "SwapXY" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Swap the X and Y values on the display. The default is false.

       1mOption "TapButton" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Set the touchscreen tap to act as mouse button 1. This allows
	      single handed operation except when using the menu buttons. The
	      default is false.

1mBUGS0m
       The driver has been tested on the Palmax systems, the defaults reflect
       the Palmax hardware and should work out of the box. No testing has been
       done on other systems using the same digitizer.

       Support for a double-tap menu button option would be nice.

       The smoothing algorithm would benefit from real mathematics.

       XFree86 needs a nice calibration tool.

       UR-98 - UR98 (TR88L803) head tracker driver

	 1mIdentifier "4m22midevname24m1m"0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mUR-98 22mis an XFree86 input driver for the Union Reality UR-F98 head-
       tracker.

       The 1mUR-98 22mdriver functions as a pointer input device, and can be used
       either as an additional input device or as the X server's core pointer.
       The driver provides support for the three axes, throttle and four but-
       tons of the controller. If mapped as the core pointer the headtracker
       provides headtracking to try and place the mouse cursor where you look.
       As a secondary input device the unit can be used for gaming, for exam-
       ple to provide the look up/down and the turn in quake, and with the Z
       axis bound to ack/forward to provide movement control.

       The default mapping maps left-right movement to X, up-down movement to
       Y and near/far movement to the Z axis. The throttle is mapped as the
       fourth axis by default but can also be mapped as button 5.

       For use in "head only" mode the Z axis can be mapped as a button. This
       allows the user to select objects with head/neck movement alone but
       takes some practice to use well.


1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       Union Reality UR-98. While this is a joystick driver the behaviour is
       absolute so this driver is not useful for true joystick interfaces.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.	 This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver 1moptions 22mare supported

       1mOption "MinX" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the left hand X value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxX" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the right hand X value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MinY" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the top Y value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxY" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the bottom Y value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MinZ" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the nearest Z value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxZ" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the furthest Z value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MinT" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the low throttle value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "MaxT" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      Set the high throttle value from the headgear, for calibration.

       1mOption "Screen" "4m22minteger24m1m"0m
	      The screen to attach to the headgear when running with multiple
	      screens.	The default is screen 0.

       1mOption "Device" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      The joystick port that is attached to the headgear interface.
	      This is usually /dev/input/js0. The digital port is not sup-
	      ported due to lack of documentation.

       1mOption "DeviceName" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the X11 device name for the headgear. This defaults to HEAD.

       1mOption "PortraitMode" "4m22mstring24m1m"0m
	      Set the display orientation. The default is "landscape" but you
	      can rotate the screen clockwise ("portrait") or anticlockwise
	      ("portraitCCW").

       1mOption "SwapXY" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Swap the X and Y values on the display. The default is false.

       1mOption "Button5" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Map the throttle as a button instead of axis 4. For some gaming
	      applications this can be more useful. The default is to map the
	      throttle as axis 4.

       1mOption "HeadButton" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Map the Z axis as button 1. This defaults to false.

       1mOption "HeadThresh" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Set the distance that is held to be mouse down.

       1mOption "HeadLock" "4m22mboolean24m1m"0m
	      Set the range of depth around the mouse down point where mouse x
	      and y movement is locked out. Set to zero to disable.

1mBUGS0m
       The "HeadButton" option is currently not implemented.

       The hardware or kernel driver has some idiosyncracies. Notably on ker-
       nel initialization the interface occasionally gets into a state where
       the readings rapidly cycle left-right-left-right or top-bottom-top-bot-
       tom.  In those cases it seems to be necessary to unload the driver,
       unplug, replug and reload the joystick drivers. Once it initializes
       sanely it remains sane.

       If the device refuses to work check the gray/black cables are plugged
       into the right ports on the unit. Be careful about this as crossing the
       cables can lead to the device failing with a nasty burning electronics
       smell. The author writes from direct experience.

       This driver is currently Linux specific.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mwacom 22mis an XFree86 input driver for Wacom devices.

       The 1mwacom 22mdriver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
       as the X server's core pointer.

1mSUPPORTED HARDWARE0m
       This driver supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols.	 Preliminary
       support is available for USB devices on some Linux platforms.

1mCONFIGURATION DETAILS0m
       Please refer to XF86Config(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.	 This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. It can be useful
       to define multiple devices with different active zones. Each device
       supports the following entries:

	       1mOption 4m22m"Type"24m 4m"stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"0m
		   sets the type of tool the device represent. This option is
		   mandatory.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Device"24m 4m"path"0m
		   sets the path to the special file which represents serial
		   line where the tablet is plugged.  You have to specify it
		   for each subsection with the same value if you want to have
		   multiple devices with the same tablet.  This option is
		   mandatory.

	       1mOption 4m22m"USB"24m 4m"on"0m
		   tells the driver to dialog with the tablet the USB way.
		   This option is only available on some Linux platforms.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DeviceName"24m 4m"name"0m
		   sets the name of the X device.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Suppress"24m 4m"Inumber"0m
		   sets the position increment under which not to transmit
		   coordinates.	 This entry must be specified only in the
		   first Wacom subsection if you have multiple devices for one
		   tablet. If you don't specify this entry, the default value
		   is computed to

	       1mOption 4m22m"Mode"24m 4m"Relative"|"Absolute"0m
		   sets the mode of the device.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Tilt"24m 4m"on"0m
		   enables tilt report if your tablet supports it (ROM version
		   1.4 and above).  If this is enabled, multiple devices at
		   the same time will not be reported.

	       1mOption 4m22m"HistorySize"24m 4m"number"0m
		   sets the motion history size. By default the value is zero.

	       1mOption 4m22m"AlwaysCore"24m 4m"on"0m
		   enables the sharing of the core pointer. When this feature
		   is enabled, the device will take control of the core
		   pointer (and thus will emit core events) and at the same
		   time will be able, when asked so, to report extended
		   events.  You can use the last available integer feedback to
		   control this feature. When the value of the feedback is
		   zero, the feature is disabled. The feature is enabled for
		   any other value.

	       1mOption 4m22m"TopX"24m 4m"number"0m
		   X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"TopY"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"BottomX"24m 4m"Inumber"0m
		   X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"BottomY"24m 4m"number"0m
		   Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.

	       1mOption 4m22m"KeepShape"24m 4m"on"0m
		   When this option is enabled, the active zone	 begins
		   according to TopX and TopY.	The bottom corner is adjusted
		   to keep the ratio width/height of the active zone the same
		   as the screen while maximizing the area described by TopX,
		   TopY, BottomX, BottomY.

	       1mOption 4m22m"DebugLevel"24m 4mnumber0m
		   sets the level of debugging info reported.

	       1mOption 4m22m"BaudRate"24m 4m"38400"24m1m, 4m22m"19200"24m 1mor 4m22m"9600"24m 1m(default)0m
		   changes the serial link speed. This option is only avail-
		   able for wacom V models (Intuos).

	       1mOption 4m22m"Serial"24m 4m"number"0m
		   sets the serial number associated with the physical device.
		   This allows to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e.
		   multiple pens). This option is only available on wacom V
		   devices (Intuos). To see which serial number belongs to a
		   device, you have to set the DebugLevel to 6 and watch the
		   output of the X server.

	       1mOption 4m22m"Threshold"24m 4m"number"0m
		   sets the pressure threshold used to generate a button 1
		   events of stylus devices for some models of tablets (Intuos
		   and Graphire).

XDARWIN(1)							    XDARWIN(1)



1mNAME0m
       XDarwin - X window system server for Darwin operating system

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXDarwin 22m[ options ] ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXDarwin24m is the X window server for Mac OS X and the Darwin operating
       system provided by the XFree86 Project. This version of 4mXDarwin24m can
       only be started from the Darwin text console. The Mac OS X Aqua GUI, if
       present, must be shut down.  4mXDarwin24m uses IOKit services to access the
       display framebuffer, mouse and keyboard and to provide a layer of hard-
       ware abstraction.  4mXDarwin24m will normally be started by the 4mxdm(1)24m dis-
       play manager or by a script that runs the program 4mxinit(1)24m.


1mOPTIONS0m
       In addition to the normal server options described in the 4mXserver(1)0m
       manual page, 4mXDarwin24m accepts the following command line switches:

       1m-fakebuttons0m
	       Emulates a 3 button mouse using modifier keys. By default, the
	       Command modifier is used to emulate button 2 and Option is used
	       for button 3. Thus, clicking the first mouse button while hold-
	       ing down Command will act like clicking button 2. Holding down
	       Option will simulate button 3.

       1m-nofakebuttons0m
	       Do not emulate a 3 button mouse. This is the default.

       1m-fakemouse2 4m22mmodifiers0m
	       Change the modifier keys used to emulate the second mouse but-
	       ton. By default, Command is used to emulate the second button.
	       Any combination of the following modifier names may be used:
	       Shift, Option, Control, Command, Fn. For example, 1m-fakemouse20m
	       1m"Option,Shift" 22mwill set holding Option, Shift and clicking on
	       button one as equivalent to clicking the second mouse button.

       1m-fakemouse3 4m22mmodifiers0m
	       Change the modifier keys used to emulate the third mouse but-
	       ton. By default, Option is used to emulate the third button.
	       Any combination of the following modifier names may be used:
	       Shift, Option, Control, Command, Fn. For example, 1m-fakemouse30m
	       1m"Control,Shift" 22mwill set holding Control, Shift and clicking on
	       button one as equivalent to clicking the third mouse button.

       1m-keymap 4m22mfile0m
	       On startup 4mXDarwin24m translates a Darwin keymapping into an X
	       keymap.	The default is to read this keymapping from
	       USA.keymapping. With this option the keymapping will be read
	       from 4mfile24m instead. If the file's path is not specified, it will
	       be searched for in Library/Keyboards/ underneath the following
	       directories (in order): ~, /, /Network, /System.

       1m-nokeymap0m
	       On startup 4mXDarwin24m translates a Darwin keymapping into an X
	       keymap.	With this option XDarwin queries the kernel for the
	       current keymapping instead of reading it from a file. This will
	       often fail on newer kernels.

       1m-size 4m22mwidth24m 4mheight0m
	       Sets the screen resolution for the X server to use.

       1m-depth 4m22mdepth0m
	       Specifies the color bit depth to use. Currently only 8, 15, and
	       24 color bits per pixel are supported.

       1m-refresh 4m22mrate0m
	       Gives the refresh rate to use in Hz. For LCD displays this
	       should be 0.


       1m-showconfig0m
	       Print out the server version and patchlevel.

       1m-version0m
	       Same as 1m-showconfig22m.

1mBUGS0m
       4mXDarwin24m and this man page still have many limitations. Some of the more
       obvious ones are:
       - The display mode cannot be changed once the X server has started.
       - A screen saver is not supported.


1mAUTHORS0m
       XFree86 was originally ported to Mac OS X Server by John Carmack. Dave
       Zarzycki used this as the basis of his port of XFree86 4.0 to Darwin
       1.0.  Torrey T. Lyons improved and integrated this code into the
       XFree86 Project's mainline for the 4.0.2 release.

       The following members of the XonX Team contributed to the following
       releases (in alphabetical order):

1mKEY MAPPING DESCRIPTION0m
       The following sections describe, in complete detail, the format of a
       raw key mapping resource, as well as the format of the 4m.keymapping24m file
       which encapsulates one or more raw mappings.

1mTypes and Data0m
       The following type definitions are employed throughout this discussion:

	      typedef unsigned char byte;
	      typedef unsigned short word;
	      typedef unsigned long dword;

       Additionally, the type definition `4mnumber24m' is used generically to indi-
       cate a numeric value.  The actual size of the `4mnumber24m' type may be one
       or two bytes depending upon how the data is stored in the key map.
       Although most key maps use byte-sized numeric values, word-sized values
       are also allowed.

       Multi-byte values in a key mapping file are stored in big-endian byte
       order.

1mKey Mapping File and Device Mapping0m
       A key mapping file begins with a magic-number and continues with a
       variable number of device-specific key mappings.

	      struct KeyMappingFile {
		  char magic_number[4];	   // `KYM1'
		  DeviceMapping maps[...]; // Variable number of maps
	      };

	      struct DeviceMapping {
		  dword interface;  // Interface type
		  dword handler_id; // Interface subtype
		  dword map_size;   // Byte count of `map' (below)
		  KeyMapping map;
	      };

       The value of `interface' represents a family of keyboard device types
       (such as Intel PC, ADB, NeXT, Sun Type5, etc.), and is generally speci-
       fied as one of the constant values NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ADB,
       NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ACE, etc., which are are defined in IOHID-
       Types.h on MacOS/X and Darwin, and in ev_types.h on MacOS/X Server,
       OpenStep, and NextStep.

       The value of `handler_id' represents a specific keyboard layout within
       the much broader `interface' family.  For instance, for a 101-key Intel
       PC keyboard (of type NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ACE) the `handler_id' is
       '0', whereas for a 102-key keyboard it is `1'.

       Together, `interface' and `handler_id' identify the exact keyboard
       hardware to which this mapping applies.	Programs which display a
       visual representation of a keyboard layout, match `interface' and `han-
       dler_id' from the 4m.keymapping24m file against the `interface' and `han-
       dler_id' values found in each 4m.keyboard24m file.

1mKey Mapping0m
       A key mapping completely defines the relationship of all scan codes
       with their associated functionality.  A 4mKeyMapping24m structure is embed-
       ded within the 4mDeviceMapping24m structure in a 4mKeyMappingFile24m.  The key
       mapping currently in use by the WindowServer and AppKit is also repre-
       sented by a 4mKeyMapping24m structure, and can be referred to directly by
       calling NXGetKeyMapping() and accessing the `mapping' data member of
       the returned 4mNXKeyMapping24m structure.

	      struct KeyMapping {
		  word number_size;	      // 0=1 byte, non-zero=2 bytes
		  number num_modifier_groups; // Modifier groups
		  ModifierGroup modifier_groups[...];
		  number num_scan_codes;      // Scan groups
		  ScanGroup scan_table[...];
		  number num_sequence_lists;  // Sequence lists
		  Sequence sequence_lists[...];
		  number num_special_keys;    // Special keys
		  SpecialKey special_key[...];
	      };

       The `number_size' flag determines the size, in bytes, of all remaining
       numeric values (denoted by the type definition `4mnumber24m') within the key
       mapping.	 If its value is zero, then numbers are represented by a sin-
       gle byte.  If it is non-zero, then numbers are represented by a word
       (two bytes).

1mModifier Group0m
       A modifier group defines all scan codes which map to a particular type
       of modifier, such as 4mshift24m, 4mcontrol24m, etc.

	      enum Modifier {
		  ALPHALOCK = 0,
		  SHIFT,
		  CONTROL,
		  ALTERNATE,
		  COMMAND,
		  KEYPAD,
		  HELP
	      };

	      struct ModifierGroup {
		  number modifier;	  // A Modifier constant
		  number num_scan_codes;
		  number scan_codes[...]; // Variable number of scan codes
	      };

       The scan_codes[] array contains a list of all scan codes which map to
       the specified modifier.	The 4mshift24m, 4mcommand24m, and 4malternate24m modifiers
       are frequently mapped to two different scan codes, apiece, since these
       modifiers often appear on both the left and right sides of the key-
       board.

1mScan Group0m
       There is one 4mScanGroup24m for each scan code generated by the given key-
       board.  This number is given by KeyMapping::num_scan_codes.  The first
       scan group represents hardware scan code 0, the second represents scan
       code 1, etc.

	      enum ModifierMask {
		  ALPHALOCK_MASK       = 1 << 0,
		  SHIFT_MASK	       = 1 << 1,
		  CONTROL_MASK	       = 1 << 2,
		  ALTERNATE_MASK       = 1 << 3,
		  CARRIAGE_RETURN_MASK = 1 << 4
	      };
	      #define NOT_BOUND 0xff

	      struct ScanGroup {
		  number mask;
		  Character characters[...];
	      };

       For each scan code, `mask' defines which modifier combinations generate
       characters.  If `mask' is NOT_BOUND (0xff) then then this scan code
       does not generate any characters ever, and its characters[] array is
       zero length.  Otherwise, the characters[] array contains one 4mCharacter0m
       record for each modifier combination.

       The number of records in characters[] is determined by computing (1 <<
       bits_set_in_mask).  In other words, if mask is zero, then zero bits are
       set, so characters[] contains only one record.  If `mask' is
       (SHIFT_MASK | CONTROL_MASK), then two bits are set, so characters[]
       contains four records.

       The first record always represents the character which is generated by
       that key when no modifiers are active.  The remaining records represent
       characters generated by the various modifier combinations.  Using the
       example with the 4mshift24m and 4mcontrol24m masks set, record two would repre-
       sent the character with the 4mshift24m modifier active; record three, the
       4mcontrol24m modifier active; and record four, both the 4mshift24m and 4mcontrol0m
       modifiers active.

       As a special case, ALPHALOCK_MASK implies SHIFT_MASK, though only
       ALPHALOCK_MASK appears in `mask'.  In this case the same character is
       generated for both the 4mshift24m and 4malpha-lock24m modifiers, but only needs
       to appear once in the characters[] array.

       CARRIAGE_RETURN_MASK does not actually refer to a modifier key.
       Instead, it is used to distinguish the scan code which is given the
       special pseudo-designation of 4mcarriage24m 4mreturn24m key.  Typically, this
       mask appears solo in a 4mScanGroup24m record and only the two 4mCharacter0m
       records for control-M and control-C follow.  This flag may be a throw-
       back to an earlier time or may be specially interpreted by the low-
       level keyboard driver, but its purpose is otherwise enigmatic.

1mCharacter0m
       Each 4mCharacter24m record indicates the character generated when this key
       is pressed, as well as the character set which contains the character.
       Well known character sets are `ASCII' and `Symbol'.  The character set
       can also be one of the meta values FUNCTION_KEY or KEY_SEQUENCE.	 If it
       is FUNCTION_KEY then `char_code' represents a generally well-known
       function key such as those enumerated by 4mFunctionKey.24m  If the character
       set is KEY_SEQUENCE then `char_code' represents is a zero-base index
       into KeyMapping::sequence_lists[].

	      enum CharacterSet {
		  ASCII	       = 0x00,
		  SYMBOL       = 0x01,
		  ...
		  FUNCTION_KEY = 0xfe,
		  KEY_SEQUENCE = 0xff
	      };

	      struct Character {
		  number set;	    // CharacterSet of generated character
		  number char_code; // Actual character generated
	      };

	      enum FunctionKey {
		  F1 = 0x20, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12,
		  INSERT, DELETE, HOME, END, PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN, PRINT_SCREEN,
		  SCROLL_LOCK, PAUSE, SYS_REQUEST, BREAK, RESET, STOP, MENU,
		  USER, SYSTEM, PRINT, CLEAR_LINE, CLEAR_DISPLAY, INSERT_LINE,
		  DELETE_LINE, INSERT_CHAR, DELETE_CHAR, PREV, NEXT, SELECT
	      };

1mSequence0m
       When Character::set contains the meta value KEY_SEQUENCE, the scan code
       is bound to a sequence of keys rather than a single character.  A
       sequence is a series of modifiers and characters which are automati-
       cally generated when the associated key is depressed.

	      #define MODIFIER_KEY 0xff

	      struct Sequence {
		  number num_chars;
		  Character characters[...];
	      };

       Each generated 4mCharacter24m is represented as previously described, with
       the exception that MODIFIER_KEY may appear in place of KEY_SEQUENCE.
       When the value of Character::set is MODIFIER_KEY then Charac-
       ter::char_code represents a modifier key rather than an actual charac-
       ter.  If the modifier represented by `char_code' is non-zero, then it
       indicates that the associated modifier key has been depressed.  In this
       case, the value is one of the constants enumerated by 4mModifier24m (SHIFT,
       CONTROL, ALTERNATE, etc.).  If the value is zero then it means that the
       modifier keys have been released.

1mSpecial Key0m
       A special key is one which is scanned directly by the Mach kernel
       rather than by the WindowServer.	 In general, events are not generated
       for special keys.

	      enum SpecialKeyType {
		  VOLUME_UP = 0,
		  VOLUME_DOWN,
		  BRIGHTNESS_UP,
		  BRIGHTNESS_DOWN,
		  ALPHA_LOCK,
		  HELP,
		  POWER,
		  SECONDARY_ARROW_UP,
		  SECONDARY_ARROW_DOWN
	      };

	      struct SpecialKey {
		  number type;	    // A SpecialKeyType constant
		  number scan_code; // Actual scan code
	      };

1mOUTPUT0m
       What follows is an explanation and description of the various pieces of
       information emitted by 4mdumpkeymap.0m

       For a more thorough discussion of any particular piece of information
       described here, refer to the detailed description of the internal lay-
       out of a key mapping provided by the 4mKey24m 4mMapping24m 4mDescription24m section
       above.

1mConventions0m
       Depending upon context, some numeric values are displayed in decimal
       notation, whereas others are displayed in hexadecimal notation.	Hexa-
       decimal numbers are denoted by a `0x' prefix (for instance, `0x7b'),
       except when explicitly noted otherwise.

1mKey Mapping Source0m
       The first piece of information presented about a particular key mapping
       is the source from which the data was gleaned.  For a 4m.keymapping24m file,
       the title `KEYMAP FILE' is emitted along with the path and name of the
       file in question.  For the key mapping currently in use by the Win-
       dowServer and AppKit, the title `ACTIVE KEYMAP' is emitted instead.

1mDevice Information0m
       Each 4m.keymapping24m file may contain one or more raw key mappings.  For
       example, a file which maps keys to a Dvorak-style layout might contain
       raw mappings for Intel PC, ADB, NeXT, and Sun Type5 keyboards.

       For each raw mapping, the following information is emitted:


	      · The title `KEYMAP' along with the mapping's relative position
		     in the 4m.keymapping24m file.

	      · The `interface' identifier.

	      · The `handler_id' sub-identifier.

	      · The size of the raw mapping resource counted in bytes.

       The `interface' and `handler_id' values, taken together, define a spe-
       cific keyboard device.  A 4m.keyboard24m file, which describes the visual
       layout of a keyboard, also contains `interface' and `handler_id' iden-
       tifiers.	 The 4m.keyboard24m file corresponding to a particular key mapping
       can be found by matching the `interface' and `handler_id' values from
       each resource.

1mModifiers0m
       Each mapping may contain zero or more modifier records which associate
       hardware scan codes with modifier descriptions such as 4mshift,24m 4mcontrol,0m
       4malternate,24m etc.  The title `MODIFIERS' is printed along with the count
       of modifier records which follow.  For each modifier record, the modi-
       fier's name is printed along with a list of scan codes, in hexadecimal
       format, which generate that modifier value.  For example:

	      MODIFIERS [4]
	      alternate: 0x1d 0x60
	      control: 0x3a
	      keypad: 0x52 0x53 ... 0x63 0x62
	      shift: 0x2a 0x36

1mCharacters0m
       Each mapping may contain zero or more character records which associate
       hardware scan codes with the actual characters generated by those scan
       codes in the presence or absence of various modifier combinations.  The
       title `CHARACTERS' is printed along with the count of character records
       which follow.  Here is a highly abbreviated example:

	      CHARACTERS [9]
	      scan 0x00: -AC-L	"a" "A" "^A" "^A" ca c7 "^A" "^A"
	      scan 0x07: -AC-L	"x" "X" "^X" "^X" 01/b4 01/ce "^X" "^X"
	      scan 0x0a: ---S-	"<" ">"
	      scan 0x13: -ACS-	"2" "@" "^@" "^@" b2 b3 "^@" "^@"
	      scan 0x24: R----	"^M" "^C"
	      scan 0x3e: -----	[F4]
	      scan 0x4a: -----	[page up]
	      scan 0x60: -----	{seq#3}
	      scan 0x68: not-bound

       For each record, the hexadecimal value of the hardware scan code is
       printed, followed by a list of modifier flag combinations and the
       actual characters generated by this scan code with and without modi-
       fiers applied.

       The modifier flags field is composed of a combination of single letter
       representations of the various modifier types.  The letters stand for:

	      L - alpha-lock
	      S - shift
	      C - control
	      A - alternate
	      R - carriage-return

       As a special case, the 4malpha-lock24m flag also implies the 4mshift24m flag, so
       these two flags never appear together in the same record.

       The combination of modifier flags determines the meaning and number of
       fields which follow.  The first field after the modifier flags always
       represents the character that will be generated if no modifier keys are
       depressed.  The remaining fields represent characters generated by the
       various modifier combinations.  The order of the fields follows this
       general pattern:


	      · The character generated by this scan code when no modifiers
		     are in effect is listed first.

	      · If the `L' or `S' flag is active, then the shifted character
		     generated by this scan code is listed next.

	      · If the `C' flag is active, then the control-character gener-
		     ated by this scan code is listed next.  Furthermore, if
		     the `L' or `S' flag is also active, then the shifted con-
		     trol-character is listed after that.

	      · If the `A' flag is active, then the alternate-character gener-
		     ated by this scan code is listed next.  Furthermore, if
		     the `L' or `S' flag is active, then the shifted alter-
		     nate-character is listed after that.  If the `C' flag is
		     also active, then the alternate-control-character is
		     listed next.  Finally, if the `C' and `L' or `C' and `S'
		     flags are also active, then the shifted alternate-con-
		     trol-character is listed.

       The `R' flag does not actually refer to a modifier key.	Instead, it is
       used to distinguish the scan code which is given the special pseudo-
       designation of 4mcarriage24m 4mreturn24m key.  Typically, this mask appears solo
       and only the two fields for control-M and control-C follow.  This flag
       may be a throwback to an earlier time or may be specially interpreted
       by the low-level keyboard driver, but its purpose is otherwise enig-
       matic.

       Recalling the example from above, the following fields can be identi-
       fied:

	      scan 0x00: -AC-L	"a" "A" "^A" "^A" ca c7 "^A" "^A"


	      · Lower-case `a' is generated when no modifiers are active.

	      · Upper-case `A' is generated when 4mshift24m or 4malpha-lock24m are
		     active.

	      · Control-A is generated when 4mcontrol24m is active.

	      · Control-A is generated when 4mcontrol24m and 4mshift24m are active.

	      · The character represented by the hexadecimal code 0xca is gen-
		     erated when 4malternate24m is active.

	      · The character represented by 0xc7 is generated when 4malternate0m
		     and 4mshift24m (or 4malpha-lock24m) are active.

	      · Control-A is generated when 4malternate24m and 4mcontrol24m are active.

	      · Control-A is generated when 4malternate,24m 4mcontrol24m and 4mshift24m (or
		     4malpha-lock24m) are active.

       The notation used to represent a particular generated character varies.


	      · Printable ASCII characters are quoted, as in "x" or "X".

	      · Control-characters are quoted and prefixed with `^', as in
		     "^X".

	      · Characters with values greater than 127 (0x7f) are displayed
		     as hexadecimal values without the `0x' prefix.

	      · Characters in a non-ASCII character set (such as `Symbol') are
		     displayed as two hexadecimal numbers separated by a
		     slash, as in `01/4a'.  The first number is the character
		     set's identification code (such as `01' for the `Symbol'
		     set), and the second number is the value of the generated
		     character.

	      · Non-printing special function characters are displayed with
		     the function's common name enclosed in brackets, as in
		     `[page up]' or `[F4]'.

	      · If the binding represents a key sequence rather than a single
		     character, then the sequence's identification number is
		     enclosed in braces, as in `{seq#3}'.

       Recalling a few examples from above, the following interpretations can
       be made:

	      scan 0x07: -AC-L	"x" "X" "^X" "^X" 01/b4 01/ce "^X" "^X"
	      scan 0x3e: -----	[F4]
	      scan 0x4a: -----	[page up]
	      scan 0x60: -----	{seq#3}


	      · "x" and "X" are printable ASCII characters.

	      · "^X" is a control-character.

	      · `01/b4' and `01/ce' represent the character codes 0xb4 and
		     0xce in the `Symbol' character set.

	      · Scan code 0x3e generates function-key `F4', and scan code 0x4a
		     generates function-key `page up'.

	      · Scan code 0x60 is bound to key sequence #3.

       Finally, if a scan code is not bound to any characters, then it is
       annotated with the label `not-bound', as with example scan code 0x68
       from above.

1mSequences0m
       A scan code (modified and unmodified) can be bound to a key sequence
       rather than generating a single character or acting as a modifier.
       When it is bound to a key sequence, a series of character invocations
       and modifier actions are automatically generated rather than a single
       keystroke.

       Each mapping may contain zero or more key sequence records.  The title
       `SEQUENCES' is printed along with the count of sequence records which
       follow.	For example:

	      SEQUENCES [3]
	      sequence 0: "f" "o" "o"
	      sequence 1: {alternate} "b" "a" "r" {unmodify}
	      sequence 2: [home] "b" "a" "z"

       The notation used to represent the sequence of generated characters is
       identical to the notation already described in the 4mCharacters24m section
       above, with the exception that modifier actions may be interposed
       between generated characters.  Such modifier actions are represented by
       the modifier's name enclosed in braces.	The special name `{unmodify}'
       indicates the release of the modifier keys.

       Thus, the sequences in the above example can be interpreted as follows:


	      · Sequence #0 generates `foo'.

	      · Sequence #1 invokes the 4malternate24m modifier, generates `bar',
		     and then releases 4malternate.0m

	      · Sequence #2 invokes the 4mhome24m key and then generates `baz'.	 In
		     a text editor, this would probably result in `baz' being
		     prepended to the line of text on which the cursor
		     resides.


1mSpecial Keys0m
       Certain keyboards feature keys which perform some type of special pur-
       pose function rather than generating a character or acting as a modi-
       fier.  For instance, Apple keyboards often contain a 4mpower24m key, and
       NeXT keyboards have historically featured screen brightness and volume
       control keys.

       Each mapping may contain zero or more special-key records which asso-
       ciate hardware scan codes with such special purpose functions.  The
       title `SPECIALS' is printed along with the count of records which fol-
       low.  For each record, the special function's name is printed along
       with a list of scan codes, in hexadecimal format, which are bound to
       that function.  For example:

	      SPECIALS [6]
	      alpha-lock: 0x39
	      brightness-down: 0x79
	      brightness-up: 0x74
	      power: 0x7f
	      sound-down: 0x77
	      sound-up: 0x73

	      A key mapping file which precisely defines the relationship of
	      all hardware-specific keyboard scan-codes with their associated
	      functionality.

       *.keyboard
	      A file describing the physical layout of keys on a particular
	      type of keyboard.	 Each `key' token in this file defines the
	      position and shape of the key on the keyboard, as well as the
	      associated scan code which that key generates.  A 4m.keymapping0m
	      file, on the other hand, defines the characters which are gener-
	      ated by a particular scan code depending upon the state of the
	      various modifier keys (such as 4mshift,24m 4mcontrol,24m etc.).  The
	      `interface' and `handler_id' values from a 4m.keymapping24m file are
	      matched against those in each 4m.keyboard24m file in order to asso-
	      ciate a particular 4m.keyboard24m file with a key mapping.  Various
	      GUI programs use the 4m.keyboard24m file to display a visual repre-
	      sentation of a keyboard for the user.  Since these files are
	      just plain text, they can be easily viewed and interpreted with-
	      out the aid of a specialized program, thus 4mdumpkeymap24m leaves
	      these files alone.

1mDIGANOSTICS0m
       The following diagnostic messages may be issued to the standard error
       stream.

       Unrecognized option.
	      An unrecognized option was specified on the command-line.
	      Invoke 4mdumpkeymap24m with the 1m--help 22moption to view a list of valid
	      options.

       Insufficient data in keymapping data stream.
	      The key mapping file or data stream is corrupt.  Either the file
	      has been incorrectly truncated or a field, such as those which
	      indicates the number of variable records which follow, contains
	      a corrupt value.

       The following diagnostic messages have significance only when trying to
       print 4m.keymapping24m files mentioned on the command-line.

       Bad magic number.
	      The mentioned file is not a 4m.keymapping24m file.  The file's con-
	      tent does not start with the string `KYM1'.

       Unable to open key mapping file.
	      The call to fopen() failed; probably because the specified path
	      is invalid or 4mdumpkeymap24m does not have permission to read the
	      file.

       Unable to determine key mapping file size.
	      The call to fstat() failed, thus memory can not be allocated for
	      loading the file.

       Unable to read key mapping file.
	      The call to fread() failed.

       The following diagnostic messages have significance only when trying to
       print the currently active key mapping when no 4m.keymapping24m files have
       been mentioned on the command-line.

       Unable to open event status driver.
	      The call to NXOpenEventStatus() failed.

       Bad key mapping length.
	      The call to NXKeyMappingLength() returned a bogus value.

       Unable to get current key mapping.
	      The call to NXGetKeyMapping() failed.

       The following diagnostic messages have significance only when using
       4mdumpkeymap24m on a non-Apple/NeXT platform.

       Must specify at least one .keymapping file.
	      No 4m.keymapping24m files were mentioned on the command-line.  On
	      non-Apple/NeXT platforms, there is no concept of a currently
	      active 4m.keymapping24m file, so at least one file must be mentioned
	      on the command-line.

       Oz Technologies.



Xvesa(1)							      Xvesa(1)



1mNAME0m
       Xvesa - VESA Bios Extensions tiny X server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXvesa 22m[4m:display24m] [4moption24m...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mXvesa 22mis a generic X server for Linux on the x86 platform.	1mXvesa0m
       doesn't know about any particular hardware, and sets the video mode by
       running the video BIOS in VM86 mode.  1mXvesa 22mcan use both standard VGA
       BIOS modes and any modes advertised by a VESA BIOS if available.

       1mXvesa 22mruns untrusted code with full privileges, and is therefore a
       fairly insecure X server.  1mThe Xvesa server should only be used in0m
       1mtrusted environments.0m

1mOPTIONS0m
       Besides the normal TinyX server's options (see TinyX(1)), 1mXvesa 22maccepts
       the following command line switches:

       1m-mode 4m22mn24m specifies the VESA video mode to use.	This option overrides
	       any 1m-screen 22moptions.

       1m-listmodes0m
	       list all supported video modes.	If 1m-force 22mwas specified before
	       1m-listmodes22m, lists all the modes that your BIOS claims to sup-
	       port, even those that the 1mXvesa 22mserver won't be able to use.

       1m-force	 22mdisable some sanity checks and use the specified mode even if
	       the BIOS claims not to support it.

       1m-shadow 22muse a shadow framebuffer even if it is not strictly necessary.
	       This may dramatically improve performance on some hardware.

       1m-nolinear0m
	       don't use a linear framebuffer even if one is available.	 You
	       don't want to use this option.

       1m-swaprgb0m
	       pass RGB values in the order that works on broken BIOSes.  Use
	       this if the colours are wrong in PseudoColor and 16 colour
	       modes.

       1m-map-holes0m
	       use a contiguous (hole-less) memory map.	 This fixes a segmen-
	       tation violation with some rare BIOSes that violate the VESA
	       specification, but may cause slightly higher memory usage on
	       systems that over-commit memory.

       1m-verbose0m
	       emit diagnostic messages during BIOS initialization and tear-
	       down.

1mKEYBOARD0m
       Multiple key presses recognized directly by 1mXvesa 22mare:

       1mCtrl+Alt+Backspace0m
	       Immediately kill the server.

       1mCtrl+Alt+F1...F120m
	       Switch to virtual console 1 through 12.

       support for standard VGA BIOS modes and is especially proud of 320x200
       16 colour mode.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mXFree86-DGA 22mextension is an X server extension for allowing client
       programs direct access to the video frame buffer.  This is a brief
       description of the programming interface for version 2.0 of the
       1mXFree86-DGA 22mextension.

       1mXFree86-DGA 22mis not intended as a direct rendering API, but rather, as a
       mechanism to "get the X Server out of the way" so that some other
       direct rendering API can have full access to the hardware.  With this
       in mind, DGA does provide clients some direct access to the hardware
       without requiring a separate rendering API, but this access is limited
       to direct linear framebuffer access.

       Most of the reasons for the 1mXFree86-DGA 22mextension's existence are now
       better served in other ways.  Further development of this extension is
       not expected, and it may be deprecated in a future release.  The fea-
       tures that continue to be useful will either be provided through other
       existing mechanisms, or through an extension that address those needs
       more specifically.  Discussion of these issue is encouraged in the
       XFree86 developer forum <4mdevel@xfree86.org24m>.

       1mXFree86-DGA 22mis initialized by passing a number corresponding to a valid
       4mXDGAMode24m to 1mXDGASetMode22m().  Clients can get a list of valid modes from
       1mXDGAQueryModes22m().  Each 4mXDGAMode24m corresponds to a different framebuffer
       layout.

       1mXDGAQueryModes22m() returns a pointer to an array of 4mXDGAMode24ms which are
       valid for the given screen.  4mnum24m is the number of elements in the
       array.  The returned array can be freed with XFree(3).  The 4mXDGAMode0m
       structure is as follows:

       typedef struct {
	  int num;
	  char *name;
	  float verticalRefresh;
	  int flags;
	  int imageWidth;
	  int imageHeight;
	  int pixmapWidth;
	  int pixmapHeight;
	  int bytesPerScanline;
	  int byteOrder;
	  int depth;
	  int bitsPerPixel;
	  unsigned long redMask;
	  unsigned long greenMask;
	  unsigned long blueMask;
	  short visualClass;
	  int viewportWidth;
	  int viewportHeight;
	  int xViewportStep;
	  int yViewportStep;
	  int maxViewportX;
	  int maxViewportY;
	  int viewportFlags;
	  int reserved1;
	  int reserved2;
       } XDGAMode;

       4mnum24m	    A unique identifying number (4mnum24m > 0) for the mode.  This is
	       the number referenced when initializing the mode.

       4mname24m    The name of the corresponding modeline as given in the XF86Con-
	       fig file.

       4mverticalRefresh0m
	       The vertical refresh rate for the modeline (in Hz).

       4mflags24m   Any of the following may be OR'd together:

	       1mXDGAConcurrentAccess0m
		   Indicates that concurrent client/server access to the
		   framebuffer is possible.  If this flag is not set it is
		   very important to call 1mXDGASync22m() before directly accessing
		   the framebuffer if a call to 1mXDGAFillRectangle22m(), 1mXDGACopy-0m
		   1mArea22m() or 1mXDGACopyTransparentArea22m() or any Xlib rendering
		   function has been made prior to such accesses.

	       1mXDGASolidFillRect0m
		   Indicates that 1mXDGAFillRectangle22m() is supported.

	       1mXDGABlitRect0m
		   Indicates that 1mXDGACopyArea22m() is supported.

	       1mXDGABlitTransRect0m
		   Indicates that 1mXDGACopyTransparentArea22m() is supported.

	       1mXDGAPixmap0m
		   Indicates that a Pixmap will be returned when the mode is
		   initialized.	 This means that rendering with Xlib is possi-
		   ble for this mode.

	       1mXDGAInterlaced0m

	       1mXDGADoublescan0m
		   Indicates that the mode is an interlaced or doublescan
		   mode.

       4mimageWidth0m

       4mimageHeight0m
	       The width and height of the framebuffer area accessible by the
	       client.	This rectangle is always justified to the upper left-
	       hand corner.

       4mpixmapWidth0m

       4mpixmapHeight0m
	       The width and height of the framebuffer area accessible by
	       Xlib.  This rectangle is always justified to the upper left-
	       hand corner.  These fields are only valid if the 1mXDGAPixmap0m
	       flag is set in the 4mflags24m field.

       4mbytesPerScanline0m
	       The pitch of the framebuffer in bytes.

       4mbyteOrder0m
	       1mMSBFirst 22mor 1mLSBFirst22m.

       4mdepth24m   The number of bits in each pixel which contain usable data.

       4mbitsPerPixel0m
	       The number of bits taken up by each pixel.

       4mredMask0m

       4mgreenMask0m

       4mblueMask0m
	       The RGB masks.  These do not apply to color-indexed modes.

       4mvisualClass0m
	       1mTrueColor22m, 1mPseudoColor22m, 1mDirectColor22m, etc.

       4mviewportWidth0m

       4mviewportHeight0m
	       The dimensions of the portion of the framebuffer which will be
	       displayed on the screen.

       4mxViewPortStep0m

       4myViewPortStep0m
	       The granularity of the x,y viewport positioning possible with
	       the 1mXDGASetViewport22m() function.

       4mmaxViewportX0m

       4mmaxViewportY0m
	       The maximum x and y positions possible with the 1mXDGASetView-0m
	       1mport22m() function.

       4mviewportFlags0m
	       Any of the following may be OR'd together

	       1mXDGAFlipRetrace0m
		   Indicates that the hardware can switch viewports during the
		   vertical retrace.

	       1mXDGAFlipImmediate0m
		   Indicates that the hardware can switch viewports immedi-
		   ately without waiting for the vertical retrace.

       1mXDGASetMode22m() initialises the 4mXDGAMode24m corresponding to 4mnum24m.  To exit
       DGA mode and return to normal server operation, call 1mXDGASetMode22m() with
       4mnum24m set to zero.  1mXDGASetMode22m() returns a pointer to an 4mXDGADevice24m if
       successful.  The XDGADevice can be freed with XFree(3).	The 4mXDGADevice0m
       structure is as follows:

       typedef struct {
	  XDGAMode mode;
	  unsigned char *data;
	  Pixmap pixmap;
       } XDGADevice;

       4mmode24m    The 4mXDGAMode24m structure, identical to the information returned
	       by 1mXDGAQueryModes22m().

       4mdata24m    If direct framebuffer access is desired and possible, this
	       field will contain a pointer to the mapped framebuffer memory.
	       Generally, this field will be zero unless a call to 1mXDGAOpen-0m
	       1mFramebuffer22m() is made prior to initialization of the mode.

       4mpixmap24m  If the mode supports Xlib rendering as indicated by 1mXDGAPixmap0m
	       in the 4mflags24m field, this will contain a Pixmap handle suitable
	       for passing as the drawable argument to Xlib functions.	This
	       field will be zero if Xlib rendering is not supported.

       1mXDGAQueryExtension22m() checks for the presence of the extension and
       returns the event and error bases.

       1mXDGAQueryVersion22m() returns the 1mXFree86-DGA 22mmajor and minor version num-
       bers.

       1mXDGAOpenFramebuffer22m() maps the framebuffer memory.	The client needs
       sufficient privileges to be able to do this.  1mXDGAOpenFramebuffer22m()
       should be called prior to initializing a DGA mode if direct framebuffer
       access is desired for that mode.	 1mXDGAOpenFramebuffer22m() does not need
       to be called if direct framebuffer access is not required.  If the
       framebuffer is opened,

       1mXDGACloseFramebuffer22m() should be called prior to client exit to unmap
       the memory.

       1mXDGAChangePixmapMode22m() can be used to change between two pixmap sizes
       in cases where a Pixmap is available for Xlib rendering.	 The following
       values for the 4mmode24m parameter are available:

	       1mXDGAPixmapModeLarge0m
		   The pixmap size is defined by the 4mpixmapWidth24m and
		   4mpixmapHeight24m fields in the 4mXDGAMode24m structure.  The 4mx24m and 4my0m
		   values are ignored in this case.

	       1mXDGAPixmapModeSmall0m
		   The pixmap size is defined by the 4mviewportWidth24m and 4mview-0m
		   4mportHeight24m fields in the 4mXDGAMode24m structure.  In this mode,
		   the 4mx24m and 4my24m values specify where in the framebuffer this
		   pixmap rectangle is located.	 It may be placed anywhere
		   within the Xlib renderable region described by the 4mpixmap-0m
		   4mWidth24m and 4mpixmapHeight24m fields in the 4mXDGAMode24m.  The 4mx24m and 4my0m
		   values returned are the resultant location of the pixmap
		   and may be different from the requested x,y location due to
		   platform specific alignment constraints.  All Xlib render-
		   ing is clipped to this pixmap rectangle.

       1mXDGASetViewport22m() sets the upper left-hand corner of the rectangle of
       framebuffer that is to be displayed on the screen.  Not all locations
       may be supported by the hardware and requested locations will be
       adjusted according to the 4mxViewPortStep24m and 4myViewPortStep24m fields in the
       4mXDGAMode24m.

       4mflags24m can be 1mXDGAFlipRetrace 22mor 1mXDGAFlipImmediate 22mto adjust the view-
       port location at the next vertical retrace or immediately.  Values
       other than the supported values advertised in the mode's 4mviewportFlags0m
       field will result in hardware-specific default behavior.	 1mXDGAFlipImme-0m
       1mdiate 22mwill block until the flip is completed.  1mXDGAFlipRetrace 22mwill
       generally NOT block so it is necessary to monitor the viewport status
       with 1mXDGAGetViewportStatus22m().  1mXDGAFlipImmediate 22mrequests during pend-
       ing 1mXDGAFlipRetrace 22mrequests will be ignored.

       1mXDGAGetViewportStatus22m() keeps track of the 1mXDGASetViewport22m() requests
       still pending.  The return value of the function will have consecutive
       bits set (LSB justified), each bit representing a pending viewport
       change.	For example:

	    while(XDGAGetViewportStatus(dpy, screen));

       waits for all pending viewport changes to finish.

	    while(0x2 & XDGAGetViewportStatus(dpy, screen));

       waits until all but the last viewport changes have completed.

       1mXDGACreateColormap22m() is similar to the Xlib function XCreateColormap(3)
       except that it takes an 4mXDGADevice24m as an argument instead of a Window
       and Visual.  Though XCreateColormap(3) may create usable colormaps in
       some cases, 1mXDGACreateColormap22m() is the preferred method for creating
       colormaps in DGA since there may not be an advertised visual compatible
       with the DGA device.

       1mXDGAInstallColormap22m() must be used to install colormaps in DGA mode.
       XInstallColormap(3) will not work.

       1mXDGASelectInput22m() enables DGA's own event mechanism.  This function is
       similar to XSelectInput(3), and all Xlib Key, Button and Motion masks
       are supported.  The following DGA events are defined:

       typedef struct {
	  int type;		/* ButtonPress or ButtonRelease + the DGA event base*/
	  unsigned long serial; /* # or last request processed by the server */
	  Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	  int screen;		/* The screen number the event came from */
	  Time time;		/* milliseconds */
	  unsigned int state;	/* key or button mask */
	  unsigned int button;	/* detail */
       } XDGAButtonEvent;

       typedef struct {
	  int type;		/* KeyPress or KeyRelease + the DGA event base*/
	  unsigned long serial; /* # or last request processed by the server */
	  Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	  int screen;		/* The screen number the event came from */
	  Time time;		/* milliseconds */
	  unsigned int state;	/* key or button mask */
	  unsigned int keycode; /* detail */
       } XDGAKeyEvent;

       typedef struct {
	  int type;		/* MotionNotify + the DGA event base*/
	  unsigned long serial; /* # or last request processed by the server */
	  Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	  int screen;		/* The screen number the event came from */
	  Time time;		/* milliseconds */
	  unsigned int state;	/* key or button mask */
	  int dx;		/* relative pointer motion */
	  int dy;		/* relative pointer motion */
       } XDGAMotionEvent;

       1mXDGAKeyEventToXKeyEvent22m() is a helper function to translate
       4mXDGAKeyEvent24ms into 4mXKeyEvent24ms suitable for use with XLookupKeysym(3).

       1mXDGAFillRectangle22m(), 1mXDGACopyArea22m(), and 1mXDGACopyTransparentArea22m() are
       included with some reservation since DGA is not intended as a rendering
       API.  These are merely convenience routines and are optionally sup-
       ported.	The associated flags will be set in the 4mXDGAMode24m's 4mflags24m field
       if these functions are supported.  These functions will be no-ops oth-
       erwise. they do not provide direct access to the hardware, but are sim-
       ply context-less operations performed by the server.

       1mXDGASync22m() blocks until all server rendering to the framebuffer com-
       pletes.	If Xlib or the 3 rendering functions above are used,
       1mXDGASync22m() must be called before the client directly accesses the
       framebuffer as the server rendering is asynchronous with the client and
       may have not completed.	This is especially important if the 1mXDGACon-0m
       1mcurrentAccess 22mflag is not set in the 4mXDGAMode24m's 4mflags24m field since con-
       current access by the server and client may result in a system lockup.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These functions provide an interface to the 4mXFree86-Misc24m extension
       which allows various server settings to be queried and changed dynami-
       cally.  Applications that use these functions must be linked with
       4m-lXxf86misc0m

   1mPOWER-SAVER FUNCTIONS0m
       The 4mXF86MiscGetSaver24m and 4mXF86MiscSetSaver24m functions have been removed.
       This functionality is now provided by the DPMS extension.

   1mMOUSE FUNCTIONS0m
       Mouse parameters can be queried using the function 4mXF86MiscGetMouseSet-0m
       4mtings24m.  The structure pointed to by its second argument is filled in
       with the current mouse settings.

       Not all fields are valid in all cases.  For example, when the protocol
       indicates a bus mouse (i.e. the type field has value 4mMTYPE_BUSMOUSE24m as
       defined in 4mxf86misc.h24m), then the value in the 4mbaudrate24m field should be
       ignored as it does not apply to bus mice.

       The 4msamplerate24m field contains the resolution in lines per inch when
       using the Hitachi tablet protocol.

       The device field of the structure points to dynamically allocated stor-
       age which should be freed by the caller.

       Any of the fields of the structure can be altered and then passed to
       the 4mXF86MiscSetMouseSettings24m function to change their value in the
       server, with the following restrictions:

	    1) The device can not be changed

	    2) The protocol can not be changed to or from Xqueue or OsMouse

	    3) The buttons field can not be changed

	    4) Invalid combinations of parameters are not allowed

       The server will generate an error if any of the above is attempted,
       except the first - the contents of the device field are simply ignored.

       A change of the protocol causes the device to be closed and reopened.
       Changes to the baud rate, sample rate, resolution or flags, when appli-
       cable to the selected protocol, also cause a reopen of the device.  A
       reopen can be forced by using the MF_REOPEN flag, except in the case of
       the OsMouse and Xqueue protocols which ignore all attempts to reopen
       the device.

   1mKEYBOARD FUNCTIONS0m
       The 4mXF86MiscGetKbdSettings24m function allows you to retrieve the current
       keyboard-related settings from the server.

       Using the 4mXF86MiscSetKbdSettings24m function, the keyboard autorepeat
       delay and rate can be set.  Requests to change the 4mtype24m and 4mservnumlock0m
       fields are ignored (except for checking for an invalid keyboard type).
       This is expected to change in a future release.

   1mOTHER FUNCTIONS0m
       Two functions, 4mXF86MiscQueryExtension24m and 4mXF86MiscQueryVersion24m, are
       provided which allow the client to query some information regarding the
       extension itself.

1mPREDEFINED VALUES0m
       The header file 4mX11/extensions/xf86misc.h24m contains definitions for

       1mMTYPE_22m*   Mouse protocols

       1mKTYPE_22m*   Keyboard types

       1mMF_22m*      Mouse flags

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These functions provide an interface to the server extension
       4mXFree86-VidModeExtension24m which allows the video modes to be queried and
       adjusted dynamically and mode switching to be controlled.  Applications
       that use these functions must be linked with 4m-lXxf86vm0m

   1mMODELINE FUNCTIONS0m
       The 4mXF86VidModeGetModeLine24m function is used to query the settings for
       the currently selected video mode.  The calling program should pass a
       pointer to a 4mXF86VidModeModeLine24m structure that it has already allo-
       cated.  The function fills in the fields of the structure.

       If there are any server private values (currently only applicable to
       the S3 server) the function will allocate storage for them.  Therefore,
       if the 4mprivsize24m field is non-zero, the calling program should call
       4mXfree(private)24m to free the storage.

       4mXF86VidModeGetAllModeLines24m returns the settings for all video modes.
       The calling program supplies the address of a pointer which will be set
       by the function to point to an array of 4mXF86VidModeModeInfo24m structures.
       The memory occupied by the array is dynamically allocated by the
       4mXF86VidModeGetAllModeLines24m function and should be freed by the caller.
       The first element of the array corresponds to the current video mode.

       The 4mXF86VidModeModModeLine24m function can be used to change the settings
       of the current video mode provided the requested settings are valid
       (e.g. they don't exceed the capabilities of the monitor).

       Modes can be deleted with the 4mXF86VidModeDeleteModeLine24m function.  The
       specified mode must match an existing mode.  To be considered a match,
       all of the fields of the given 4mXF86VidModeModeInfo24m structure must
       match, except the 4mprivsize24m and 4mprivate24m fields.	 If the mode to be
       deleted is the current mode, a mode switch to the next mode will occur
       first.  The last remaining mode can not be deleted.

       The validity of a mode can be checked with the 4mXF86VidModeValidateMode-0m
       4mLine24m function.  If the specified mode can be used by the server (i.e.
       meets all the constraints placed upon a mode by the combination of the
       server, card, and monitor) the function returns 4mMODE_OK24m, otherwise it
       returns a value indicating the reason why the mode is invalid (as
       defined in 4mxf86.h24m)

   1mMODE SWITCH FUNCTIONS0m
       When the function 4mXF86VidModeSwitchMode24m is called, the server will
       change the video mode to next (or previous) video mode. The 4mXF86VidMod-0m
       4meSwitchToMode24m function can be used to switch directly to the specified
       mode.  Matching is as specified in the description of the 4mXF86VidMod-0m
       4meAddModeLine24m function above.  The 4mXF86VidModeLockModeSwitch24m function
       can be used to allow or disallow mode switching whether the request to
       switch modes comes from a call to the 4mXF86VidModeSwitchMode24m or 4mXF86Vid-0m
       4mModeSwitchToMode24m functions or from one of the mode switch key
       sequences.

       Note: Because of the asynchronous nature of the X protocol, a call to
       4mXFlush24m is needed if the application wants to see the mode change imme-
       diately.	 To be informed of the execution status of the request, a cus-
       tom error handler should be installed using 4mXSetErrorHandler24m before
       calling the mode switching function.

   1mMONITOR FUNCTIONS0m
       Information known to the server about the monitor is returned by the
       4mXF86VidModeGetMonitor24m function.  The 4mhsync24m and 4mvsync24m fields each point
       to an array of 4mXF86VidModeSyncRange24m structures.  The arrays contain
       4mnhsync24m and 4mnvsync24m elements, respectively.  The 4mhi24m and 4mlow24m values will
       be equal if a discreate value was given in the 4mXF86Config24m file.

       The 4mvendor24m, 4mmodel24m, 4mhsync24m, and 4mvsync24m fields point to dynamically allo-
       cated storage that should be freed by the caller.

   1mVIEWPORT FUNCTIONS0m
       The 4mXF86VidModeGetViewPort24m and 4mXF86VidModeSetViewPort24m functions can be
       used to, respectively, query and change the location of the upper left
       corner of the viewport into the virtual screen.

   1mOTHER FUNCTIONS0m
       The 4mXF86VidModeQueryVersion24m function can be used to determine the ver-
       sion of the extension built into the server.

       The function 4mXF86VidModeQueryExtension24m returns the lowest numbered
       error and event values assigned to the extension.

1mBUGS0m
       The XF86VidModeSetClientVersion, XF86VidModeGetDotClocks, XF86VidMod-
       eGetGamma, XF86VidModeSetGamma, XF86VidModeSetGammaRamp, XF86VidMod-
       eGetGammaRamp, XF86VidModeGetGammaRampSize, and XF86VidModeGetPermis-
       sions functions need to be documented.  In the meantime, check the

1mNAME0m
       X - a portable, network-transparent window system

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       The X Window System is a network transparent window system which runs
       on a wide range of computing and graphics machines.  It should be rela-
       tively straightforward to build the X Consortium software distribution
       on most ANSI C and POSIX compliant systems.  Commercial implementations
       are also available for a wide range of platforms.

       The X Consortium requests that the following names be used when refer-
       ring to this software:

					  X
				   X Window System
				    X Version 11
			     X Window System, Version 11
					 X11

       4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m is a trademark of X Consortium, Inc.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       X Window System servers run on computers with bitmap displays.  The
       server distributes user input to and accepts output requests from vari-
       ous client programs through a variety of different interprocess commu-
       nication channels.  Although the most common case is for the client
       programs to be running on the same machine as the server, clients can
       be run transparently from other machines (including machines with dif-
       ferent architectures and operating systems) as well.

       X supports overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text and graphics
       operations, on both monochrome and color displays.  For a full explana-
       tion of the functions that are available, see the 4mXlib24m 4m-24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mX0m
       4mInterface24m manual, the 4mX24m 4mWindow24m 4mSystem24m 4mProtocol24m specification, the 4mX0m
       4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m-24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m manual, and various toolkit
       documents.

       The number of programs that use 4mX24m is quite large.  Programs provided in
       the core X Consortium distribution include: a terminal emulator, 4mxterm24m;
       a window manager, 4mtwm24m; a display manager, 4mxdm24m; a console redirect pro-

       Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits, etc. are
       included as user-contributed software in the X Consortium distribution,
       or are available using anonymous ftp on the Internet.  See your site
       administrator for details.

1mSTARTING UP0m
       There are two main ways of getting the X server and an initial set of
       client applications started.  The particular method used depends on
       what operating system you are running and whether or not you use other
       window systems in addition to X.

       4mxdm24m 1m(the X Display Manager)0m
	       If you want to always have X running on your display, your site
	       administrator can set your machine up to use the X Display Man-
	       ager 4mxdm24m.  This program is typically started by the system at
	       boot time and takes care of keeping the server running and get-
	       ting users logged in.  If you are running 4mxdm24m, you will see a
	       window on the screen welcoming you to the system and asking for
	       your username and password.  Simply type them in as you would
	       at a normal terminal, pressing the Return key after each.  If
	       you make a mistake, 4mxdm24m will display an error message and ask
	       you to try again.  After you have successfully logged in, 4mxdm0m
	       will start up your X environment.  By default, if you have an
	       executable file named 4m.xsession24m in your home directory, 4mxdm0m
	       will treat it as a program (or shell script) to run to start up
	       your initial clients (such as terminal emulators, clocks, a
	       window manager, user settings for things like the background,
	       the speed of the pointer, etc.).	 Your site administrator can
	       provide details.

       4mxinit24m 1m(run manually from the shell)0m
	       Sites that support more than one window system might choose to
	       use the 4mxinit24m program for starting X manually.  If this is true
	       for your machine, your site administrator will probably have
	       provided a program named "x11", "startx", or "xstart" that will
	       do site-specific initialization (such as loading convenient
	       default resources, running a window manager, displaying a
	       clock, and starting several terminal emulators) in a nice way.
	       If not, you can build such a script using the 4mxinit24m program.
	       This utility simply runs one user-specified program to start
	       the server, runs another to start up any desired clients, and
	       then waits for either to finish.	 Since either or both of the
	       user-specified programs may be a shell script, this gives sub-
	       stantial flexibility at the expense of a nice interface.	 For
	       this reason, 4mxinit24m is not intended for end users.

1mDISPLAY NAMES0m
       From the user's perspective, every X server has a 4mdisplay24m 4mname24m of the
       form:

			 4mhostname:displaynumber.screennumber0m

       This information is used by the application to determine how it should
       connect to the server and which screen it should use by default (on
       displays with multiple monitors):

       4mhostname0m
	       The 4mhostname24m specifies the name of the machine to which the
	       display is physically connected.	 If the hostname is not given,
	       the most efficient way of communicating to a server on the same
	       machine will be used.

       4mdisplaynumber0m
	       The phrase "display" is usually used to refer to collection of
	       monitors that share a common keyboard and pointer (mouse,
	       tablet, etc.).  Most workstations tend to only have one key-
	       board, and therefore, only one display.	Larger, multi-user
	       systems, however, frequently have several displays so that more
	       than one person can be doing graphics work at once.  To avoid
	       confusion, each display on a machine is assigned a 4mdisplay24m 4mnum-0m
	       4mber24m (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is
	       started.	 The display number must always be given in a display
	       name.

       4mscreennumber0m
	       Some displays share a single keyboard and pointer among two or
	       more monitors.  Since each monitor has its own set of windows,
	       each screen is assigned a 4mscreen24m 4mnumber24m (beginning at 0) when
	       the X server for that display is started.  If the screen number
	       is not given, screen 0 will be used.

       On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in your DISPLAY
       environment variable.  This variable is set automatically by the 4mxterm0m
       terminal emulator.  However, when you log into another machine on a
       network, you will need to set DISPLAY by hand to point to your display.
       For example,

	   % setenv DISPLAY myws:0
	   $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY
       The 4mxon24m script can be used to start an X program on a remote machine;
       it automatically sets the DISPLAY variable correctly.

       Finally, most X programs accept a command line option of 1m-display 4m22mdis-0m
       4mplayname24m to temporarily override the contents of DISPLAY.  This is most
       commonly used to pop windows on another person's screen or as part of a
       "remote shell" command to start an xterm pointing back to your display.
       For example,

	   % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0
	   % rsh big xterm -display myws:0 -ls </dev/null &

       X servers listen for connections on a variety of different communica-
       tions channels (network byte streams, shared memory, etc.).  Since
       there can be more than one way of contacting a given server, The 4mhost-0m
       4mname24m part of the display name is used to determine the type of channel
       (also called a transport layer) to be used.  X servers generally sup-
       port the following types of connections:

       4mlocal0m
	       The hostname part of the display name should be the empty
	       string.	For example:  4m:024m, 4m:124m, and 4m:0.124m.	The most efficient
	       local transport will be chosen.

       4mTCPIP0m
	       The hostname part of the display name should be the server
	       machine's IP address name.  Full Internet names, abbreviated
	       names, and IP addresses are all allowed.	 For example:
	       4mx.org:024m, 4mexpo:024m, 4m198.112.45.11:024m, 4mbigmachine:124m, and 4mhydra:0.124m.

       4mDECnet0m
	       The hostname part of the display name should be the server
	       machine's nodename, followed by two colons instead of one.  For
	       example:	 4mmyws::024m, 4mbig::124m, and 4mhydra::0.124m.


1mACCESS CONTROL0m
       An X server can use several types of access control.  Mechanisms pro-
       vided in Release 6 are:
	   Host Access			 Simple host-based access control.
	   MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1		 Shared plain-text "cookies".
	   XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1		 Secure DES based private-keys.
	   SUN-DES-1			 Based on Sun's secure rpc system.
	   MIT-KERBEROS-5		 Kerberos Version 5 user-to-user.

       4mXdm24m initializes access control for the server and also places autho-
       rization information in a file accessible to the user.  Normally, the
       list of hosts from which connections are always accepted should be
       empty, so that only clients with are explicitly authorized can connect
       to the display.	When you add entries to the host list (with 4mxhost24m),
       the server no longer performs any authorization on connections from
       those machines.	Be careful with this.

       The file from which 4mXlib24m extracts authorization data can be specified
       with the environment variable 1mXAUTHORITY22m, and defaults to the file
       1m.Xauthority 22min the home directory.	4mXdm24m uses 1m$HOME/.Xauthority 22mand will
       create it or merge in authorization records if it already exists when a
       user logs in.

       If you use several machines and share a common home directory across
       all of the machines by means of a network file system, you never really
       have to worry about authorization files, the system should work cor-
       rectly by default.  Otherwise, as the authorization files are machine-
       independent, you can simply copy the files to share them.  To manage
       authorization files, use 4mxauth24m.  This program allows you to extract
       records and insert them into other files.  Using this, you can send
       authorization to remote machines when you login, if the remote machine
       does not share a common home directory with your local machine.	Note
       that authorization information transmitted ``in the clear'' through a
       network file system or using 4mftp24m or 4mrcp24m can be ``stolen'' by a network
       eavesdropper, and as such may enable unauthorized access.  In many
       environments, this level of security is not a concern, but if it is,
       you need to know the exact semantics of the particular authorization
       data to know if this is actually a problem.

       For more information on access control, see the 4mXsecurity24m manual page.

1mGEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS0m
       One of the advantages of using window systems instead of hardwired ter-
       minals is that applications don't have to be restricted to a particular
       size or location on the screen.	Although the layout of windows on a
       display is controlled by the window manager that the user is running
       (described below), most X programs accept a command line argument of
       the form 1m-geometry 4m22mWIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF24m (where 4mWIDTH24m, 4mHEIGHT24m, 4mXOFF24m,
       and 4mYOFF24m are numbers) for specifying a preferred size and location for
       this application's main window.

       The 4mWIDTH24m and 4mHEIGHT24m parts of the geometry specification are usually
       measured in either pixels or characters, depending on the application.
       The 4mXOFF24m and 4mYOFF24m parts are measured in pixels and are used to specify
       the distance of the window from the left or right and top and bottom
       edges of the screen, respectively.  Both types of offsets are measured
       from the indicated edge of the screen to the corresponding edge of the
       window.	The X offset may be specified in the following ways:

       4m+XOFF24m   The left edge of the window is to be placed 4mXOFF24m pixels in from
	       the left edge of the screen (i.e., the X coordinate of the win-
	       dow's origin will be 4mXOFF24m).	 4mXOFF24m may be negative, in which
	       case the window's left edge will be off the screen.

       4m-XOFF24m   The right edge of the window is to be placed 4mXOFF24m pixels in
	       from the right edge of the screen.  4mXOFF24m may be negative, in
	       which case the window's right edge will be off the screen.

       The Y offset has similar meanings:

       4m+YOFF24m   The top edge of the window is to be 4mYOFF24m pixels below the top
	       edge of the screen (i.e., the Y coordinate of the window's ori-
	       gin will be 4mYOFF24m).	4mYOFF24m may be negative, in which case the
	       window's top edge will be off the screen.

       4m-YOFF24m   The bottom edge of the window is to be 4mYOFF24m pixels above the
	       bottom edge of the screen.  4mYOFF24m may be negative, in which case
	       the window's bottom edge will be off the screen.

       Offsets must be given as pairs; in other words, in order to specify
       either 4mXOFF24m or 4mYOFF24m both must be present.  Windows can be placed in the
       four corners of the screen using the following specifications:

       4m+0+024m    upper left hand corner.

       4m-0+024m    upper right hand corner.

       4m-0-024m    lower right hand corner.

       4m+0-024m    lower left hand corner.

       In the following examples, a terminal emulator is placed in roughly the
       center of the screen and a load average monitor, mailbox, and clock are
       placed in the upper right hand corner:

	   xterm -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &
	   xclock -geometry 48x48-0+0 &
	   xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &
	   xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &


1mWINDOW MANAGERS0m
       The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special programs
       called 4mwindow24m 4mmanagers24m.  Although many window managers will honor geom-
       etry specifications as given, others may choose to ignore them (requir-
       ing the user to explicitly draw the window's region on the screen with
       the pointer, for example).

       Since window managers are regular (albeit complex) client programs, a
       variety of different user interfaces can be built.  The X Consortium
       distribution comes with a window manager named 4mtwm24m which supports over-
       lapping windows, popup menus, point-and-click or click-to-type input
       models, title bars, nice icons (and an icon manager for those who don't
       like separate icon windows).

       See the user-contributed software in the X Consortium distribution for
       other popular window managers.

1mFONT NAMES0m
       Collections of characters for displaying text and symbols in X are
       known as 4mfonts24m.  A font typically contains images that share a common
       appearance and look nice together (for example, a single size, bold-
       ness, slant, and character set).	 Similarly, collections of fonts that
       are based on a common type face (the variations are usually called
       roman, bold, italic, bold italic, oblique, and bold oblique) are called
       4mfamilies24m.

       Fonts come in various sizes.  The X server supports 4mscalable24m fonts,
       meaning it is possible to create a font of arbitrary size from a single
       source for the font.  The server supports scaling from 4moutline24m fonts
       and 4mbitmap24m fonts.  Scaling from outline fonts usually produces signifi-
       cantly better results than scaling from bitmap fonts.

       An X server can obtain fonts from individual files stored in directo-
       ries in the file system, or from one or more font servers, or from a
       mixtures of directories and font servers.  The list of places the
       server looks when trying to find a font is controlled by its 4mfont24m 4mpath24m.
       Although most installations will choose to have the server start up
       with all of the commonly used font directories in the font path, the
       font path can be changed at any time with the 4mxset24m program.	 However,
       it is important to remember that the directory names are on the
       1mserver22m's machine, not on the application's.

       Bitmap font files are usually created by compiling a textual font
       description into binary form, using 4mbdftopcf24m.  Font databases are cre-
       ated by running the 4mmkfontdir24m program in the directory containing the
       source or compiled versions of the fonts.  Whenever fonts are added to
       a directory, 4mmkfontdir24m should be rerun so that the server can find the
       new fonts.  To make the server reread the font database, reset the font
       path with the 4mxset24m program.	 For example, to add a font to a private
       directory, the following commands could be used:

	   % cp newfont.pcf ~/myfonts
	   % mkfontdir ~/myfonts
	   % xset fp rehash

       The 4mxfontsel24m and 4mxlsfonts24m programs can be used to browse through the
       fonts available on a server.  Font names tend to be fairly long as they
       contain all of the information needed to uniquely identify individual
       fonts.  However, the X server supports wildcarding of font names, so
       the full specification

	   4m-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-10m

       might be abbreviated as:

	   4m-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-10m

       Because the shell also has special meanings for 4m*24m and 4m?24m, wildcarded
       font names should be quoted:

	   % xlsfonts -fn '-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*'

       The 4mxlsfonts24m program can be used to list all of the fonts that match a
       given pattern.  With no arguments, it lists all available fonts.	 This
       will usually list the same font at many different sizes.	 To see just
       the base scalable font names, try using one of the following patterns:

	   4m-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-0-0-*-0-*-*0m
	   4m-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-75-75-*-0-*-*0m
	   4m-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-100-100-*-0-*-*0m

       To convert one of the resulting names into a font at a specific size,
       replace one of the first two zeros with a nonzero value.	 The field
       containing the first zero is for the pixel size; replace it with a spe-
       cific height in pixels to name a font at that size.  Alternatively, the
       field containing the second zero is for the point size; replace it with
       a specific size in decipoints (there are 722.7 decipoints to the inch)
       to name a font at that size.  The last zero is an average width field,
       measured in tenths of pixels; some servers will anamorphically scale if
       this value is specified.

1mFONT SERVER NAMES0m
       One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that
       accepts TCP connections:

	   tcp/4mhostname24m:4mport0m
	   tcp/4mhostname24m:4mport24m/4mcataloguelist0m

       The 4mhostname24m specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the
       machine on which the font server is running.  The 4mport24m is the decimal
       TCP port on which the font server is listening for connections.	The
       4mcataloguelist24m specifies a list of catalogue names, with '+' as a sepa-
       rator.

       Examples: 4mtcp/x.org:710024m, 4mtcp/198.112.45.11:7100/all24m.

       One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that
       accepts DECnet connections:

	   decnet/4mnodename24m::font$4mobjname0m
	   decnet/4mnodename24m::font$4mobjname24m/4mcataloguelist0m

       The 4mnodename24m specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the
       machine on which the font server is running.  The 4mobjname24m is a normal,
       case-insensitive DECnet object name.  The 4mcataloguelist24m specifies a
       list of catalogue names, with '+' as a separator.

       Examples: 4mDECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT24m, 4mdecnet/44.70::font$special/sym-0m
       4mbols24m.

1mCOLOR NAMES0m
       Most applications provide ways of tailoring (usually through resources
       or command line arguments) the colors of various elements in the text
       and graphics they display.  A color can be specified either by an
       abstract color name, or by a numerical color specification.  The numer-
       ical specification can identify a color in either device-dependent
       (RGB) or device-independent terms.  Color strings are case-insensitive.

       X supports the use of abstract color names, for example, "red", "blue".
       A value for this abstract name is obtained by searching one or more
       color name databases.  4mXlib24m first searches zero or more client-side
       databases; the number, location, and content of these databases is
       implementation dependent.  If the name is not found, the color is
       looked up in the X server's database.  The text form of this database
       is commonly stored in the file 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt24m.

       A numerical color specification consists of a color space name and a
       set of values in the following syntax:

	   4m<color_space_name>24m:4m<value>/.../<value>0m

       An RGB Device specification is identified by the prefix "rgb:" and has
       the following syntax:

	   rgb:4m<red>/<green>/<blue>0m

	       4m<red>24m, 4m<green>24m, 4m<blue>24m := 4mh24m | 4mhh24m | 4mhhh24m | 4mhhhh0m
	       4mh24m := single hexadecimal digits
       Note that 4mh24m indicates the value scaled in 4 bits, 4mhh24m the value scaled
       in 8 bits, 4mhhh24m the value scaled in 12 bits, and 4mhhhh24m the value scaled
       in 16 bits, respectively.  These values are passed directly to the X
       server, and are assumed to be gamma corrected.

       The eight primary colors can be represented as:

	   black		rgb:0/0/0
	   red			rgb:ffff/0/0
	   green		rgb:0/ffff/0
	   blue			rgb:0/0/ffff
	   yellow		rgb:ffff/ffff/0
	   magenta		rgb:ffff/0/ffff
	   cyan			rgb:0/ffff/ffff
	   white		rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff

       For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB Device is sup-
       ported, but its continued use is not encouraged.	 The syntax is an ini-
       tial sharp sign character followed by a numeric specification, in one
       of the following formats:

	   #RGB			     (4 bits each)
	   #RRGGBB		     (8 bits each)
	   #RRRGGGBBB		     (12 bits each)
	   #RRRRGGGGBBBB	     (16 bits each)

       The R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal digits.  When fewer than
       16 bits each are specified, they represent the most-significant bits of
       the value (unlike the "rgb:" syntax, in which values are scaled).  For
       example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.

       An RGB intensity specification is identified by the prefix "rgbi:" and
       has the following syntax:

	   rgbi:4m<red>/<green>/<blue>0m

       The red, green, and blue are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0,
       inclusive.  They represent linear intensity values, with 1.0 indicating
       full intensity, 0.5 half intensity, and so on.  These values will be
       gamma corrected by 4mXlib24m before being sent to the X server.	The input
       format for these values is an optional sign, a string of numbers possi-
       bly containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent field contain-
       ing an E or e followed by a possibly signed integer string.

       The standard device-independent string specifications have the follow-
       ing syntax:

	   CIEXYZ:4m<X>/<Y>/<Z>24m	       (4mnone24m, 1, 4mnone24m)
	   CIEuvY:4m<u>/<v>/<Y>24m	       (~.6, ~.6, 1)
	   CIExyY:4m<x>/<y>/<Y>24m	       (~.75, ~.85, 1)
	   CIELab:4m<L>/<a>/<b>24m	       (100, 4mnone24m, 4mnone24m)
	   CIELuv:4m<L>/<u>/<v>24m	       (100, 4mnone24m, 4mnone24m)
	   TekHVC:4m<H>/<V>/<C>24m	       (360, 100, 100)

       All of the values (C, H, V, X, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y, x) are floating
       point values.  Some of the values are constrained to be between zero
       and some upper bound; the upper bounds are given in parentheses above.
       The syntax for these values is an optional '+' or '-' sign, a string of
       digits possibly containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent
       field consisting of an 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional '+' or '-'
       followed by a string of digits.

       For more information on device independent color, see the 4mXlib24m refer-
       ence manual.

1mKEYBOARDS0m
       The X keyboard model is broken into two layers:	server-specific codes
       (called 4mkeycodes24m) which represent the physical keys, and server-inde-
       pendent symbols (called 4mkeysyms24m) which represent the letters or words
       that appear on the keys.	 Two tables are kept in the server for con-
       verting keycodes to keysyms:

       4mmodifier24m 4mlist0m
	       Some keys (such as Shift, Control, and Caps Lock) are known as
	       4mmodifier24m and are used to select different symbols that are
	       attached to a single key (such as Shift-a generates a capital
	       A, and Control-l generates a control character ^L).  The server
	       keeps a list of keycodes corresponding to the various modifier
	       keys.  Whenever a key is pressed or released, the server gener-
	       ates an 4mevent24m that contains the keycode of the indicated key as
	       well as a mask that specifies which of the modifier keys are
	       currently pressed.  Most servers set up this list to initially
	       contain the various shift, control, and shift lock keys on the
	       keyboard.

       4mkeymap24m 4mtable0m
	       Applications translate event keycodes and modifier masks into
	       keysyms using a 4mkeysym24m 4mtable24m which contains one row for each
	       keycode and one column for various modifier states.  This table
	       is initialized by the server to correspond to normal typewriter
	       conventions.  The exact semantics of how the table is inter-
	       preted to produce keysyms depends on the particular program,
	       libraries, and language input method used, but the following
	       conventions for the first four keysyms in each row are gener-
	       ally adhered to:

       The first four elements of the list are split into two groups of
       keysyms.	 Group 1 contains the first and second keysyms; Group 2 con-
       tains the third and fourth keysyms.  Within each group, if the first
       element is alphabetic and the the second element is the special keysym
       4mNoSymbol24m, then the group is treated as equivalent to a group in which
       the first element is the lowercase letter and the second element is the
       uppercase letter.

       Switching between groups is controlled by the keysym named MODE SWITCH,
       by attaching that keysym to some key and attaching that key to any one
       of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5.  This modifier is called the
       ``group modifier.''  Group 1 is used when the group modifier is off,
       and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.

       Within a group, the modifier state determines which keysym to use.  The
       first keysym is used when the Shift and Lock modifiers are off.	The
       second keysym is used when the Shift modifier is on, when the Lock mod-
       ifier is on and the second keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when the
       Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as ShiftLock.  Otherwise, when
       the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as CapsLock, the state of
       the Shift modifier is applied first to select a keysym; but if that
       keysym is lowercase alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase keysym
       is used instead.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Most X programs attempt to use the same names for command line options
       and arguments.  All applications written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics
       automatically accept the following options:

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the name of the X server to use.

       1m-geometry 4m22mgeometry0m
	       This option specifies the initial size and location of the win-
	       dow.

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor24m1m, -background 4m22mcolor0m
	       Either option specifies the color to use for the window back-
	       ground.

       1m-bd 4m22mcolor24m1m, -bordercolor 4m22mcolor0m
	       Either option specifies the color to use for the window border.

       1m-bw 4m22mnumber24m1m, -borderwidth 4m22mnumber0m
	       Either option specifies the width in pixels of the window bor-
	       der.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor24m1m, -foreground 4m22mcolor0m
	       Either option specifies the color to use for text or graphics.

       1m-fn 4m22mfont24m1m, -font 4m22mfont0m
	       Either option specifies the font to use for displaying text.

       1m-iconic0m
	       This option indicates that the user would prefer that the
	       application's windows initially not be visible as if the win-
	       dows had be immediately iconified by the user.  Window managers
	       may choose not to honor the application's request.

       1m-name0m
	       This option specifies the name under which resources for the
	       application should be found.  This option is useful in shell
	       aliases to distinguish between invocations of an application,
	       without resorting to creating links to alter the executable
	       file name.

       1m-rv22m, 1m-reverse0m
	       Either option indicates that the program should simulate
	       reverse video if possible, often by swapping the foreground and
	       background colors.  Not all programs honor this or implement it
	       correctly.  It is usually only used on monochrome displays.

       1m+rv0m
	       This option indicates that the program should not simulate
	       reverse video.  This is used to override any defaults since
	       reverse video doesn't always work properly.

       1m-selectionTimeout0m
	       This option specifies the timeout in milliseconds within which
	       two communicating applications must respond to one another for
	       a selection request.

       1m-synchronous0m
	       This option indicates that requests to the X server should be
	       sent synchronously, instead of asynchronously.  Since 4mXlib24m nor-
	       mally buffers requests to the server, errors do not necessarily
	       get reported immediately after they occur.  This option turns
	       off the buffering so that the application can be debugged.  It
	       should never be used with a working program.

       1m-title 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the title to be used for this window.
	       This information is sometimes used by a window manager to pro-
	       vide some sort of header identifying the window.

       1m-xnllanguage 4m22mlanguage[_territory][.codeset]0m
	       This option specifies the language, territory, and codeset for
	       use in resolving resource and other filenames.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       This option specifies a resource name and value to override any
	       defaults.  It is also very useful for setting resources that
	       don't have explicit command line arguments.

1mRESOURCES0m
       To make the tailoring of applications to personal preferences easier, X
       provides a mechanism for storing default values for program resources
       (e.g. background color, window title, etc.)  Resources are specified as
       strings that are read in from various places when an application is
       run.  Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with each
       node in the hierarchy identified by a class and an instance name.  At
       the top level is the class and instance name of the application itself.
       By convention, the class name of the application is the same as the
       program name, but with  the first letter capitalized (e.g. 4mBitmap24m or
       4mEmacs24m) although some programs that begin with the letter ``x'' also
       capitalize the second letter for historical reasons.

       The precise syntax for resources is:

       ResourceLine	 = Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | <empty line>
       Comment		 = "!" {<any character except null or newline>}
       IncludeFile	 = "#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
       FileName		 = <valid filename for operating system>
       ResourceSpec	 = WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
       ResourceName	 = [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
       Binding		 = "." | "*"
       WhiteSpace	 = {<space> | <horizontal tab>}
       Component	 = "?" | ComponentName
       ComponentName	 = NameChar {NameChar}
       NameChar		 = "a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
       Value		 = {<any character except null or unescaped newline>}

       Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.	 Curly braces
       ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of the enclosed elements.
       Square brackets ([...]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
       Quotes ("...") are used around literal characters.

       IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line with the con-
       tents of the specified file.  The word "include" must be in lowercase.
       The filename is interpreted relative to the directory of the file in
       which the line occurs (for example, if the filename contains no direc-
       tory or contains a relative directory specification).

       If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two or more Binding
       characters, the sequence will be replaced with single "." character if
       the sequence contains only "." characters, otherwise the sequence will
       be replaced with a single "*" character.

       A resource database never contains more than one entry for a given
       ResourceName.  If a resource file contains multiple lines with the same
       ResourceName, the last line in the file is used.

       Any whitespace character before or after the name or colon in a
       ResourceSpec are ignored.  To allow a Value to begin with whitespace,
       the two-character sequence ``\4mspace24m'' (backslash followed by space) is
       recognized and replaced by a space character, and the two-character
       sequence ``\4mtab24m'' (backslash followed by horizontal tab) is recognized
       and replaced by a horizontal tab character.  To allow a Value to con-
       tain embedded newline characters, the two-character sequence ``\n'' is
       recognized and replaced by a newline character.	To allow a Value to be
       broken across multiple lines in a text file, the two-character sequence
       ``\4mnewline24m'' (backslash followed by newline) is recognized and removed
       from the value.	To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes,
       the four-character sequence ``\4mnnn24m'', where each 4mn24m is a digit character
       in the range of ``0''-``7'', is recognized and replaced with a single
       byte that contains the octal value specified by the sequence.  Finally,
       the two-character sequence ``\\'' is recognized and replaced with a
       single backslash.

       When an application looks for the value of a resource, it specifies a
       complete path in the hierarchy, with both class and instance names.
       However, resource values are usually given with only partially speci-
       fied names and classes, using pattern matching constructs.  An asterisk
       (*) is a loose binding and is used to represent any number of interven-
       ing components, including none.	A period (.) is a tight binding and is
       used to separate immediately adjacent components.  A question mark (?)
       is used to match any single component name or class.  A database entry
       cannot end in a loose binding; the final component (which cannot be
       "?") must be specified.	The lookup algorithm searches the resource
       database for the entry that most closely matches (is most specific for)
       the full name and class being queried.  When more than one database
       entry matches the full name and class, precedence rules are used to
       select just one.

       The full name and class are scanned from left to right (from highest
       level in the hierarchy to lowest), one component at a time.  At each
       level, the corresponding component and/or binding of each matching
       entry is determined, and these matching components and bindings are
       compared according to precedence rules.	Each of the rules is applied
       at each level, before moving to the next level, until a rule selects a
       single entry over all others.  The rules (in order of precedence) are:

       1.   An entry that contains a matching component (whether name, class,
	    or "?")  takes precedence over entries that elide the level (that
	    is, entries that match the level in a loose binding).

       2.   An entry with a matching name takes precedence over both entries
	    with a matching class and entries that match using "?".  An entry
	    with a matching class takes precedence over entries that match
	    using "?".

       3.   An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence over entries
	    preceded by a loose binding.

       Programs based on the X Tookit Intrinsics obtain resources from the
       following sources (other programs usually support some subset of these
       sources):

       1mRESOURCE_MANAGER root window property0m
	       Any global resources that should be available to clients on all
	       machines should be stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on
	       the root window of the first screen using the 4mxrdb24m program.
	       This is frequently taken care of when the user starts up X
	       through the display manager or 4mxinit24m.

       1mSCREEN_RESOURCES root window property0m
	       Any resources specific to a given screen (e.g. colors) that
	       should be available to clients on all machines should be stored
	       in the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of that
	       screen.	The 4mxrdb24m program will sort resources automatically and
	       place them in RESOURCE_MANAGER or SCREEN_RESOURCES, as appro-
	       priate.

       1mapplication-specific files0m
	       Directories named by the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCH-
	       PATH or the environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (which names a
	       single directory and should end with a '/' on POSIX systems),
	       plus directories in a standard place (usually under
	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/, but this can be overridden with the XFILE-
	       SEARCHPATH environment variable) are searched for for applica-
	       tion-specific resources.	 For example, application default
	       resources are usually kept in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/.
	       See the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m 4m-24m 4mC24m 4mLanguage24m 4mInterface24m manual for
	       details.

       1mXENVIRONMENT0m
	       Any user- and machine-specific resources may be specified by
	       setting the XENVIRONMENT environment variable to the name of a
	       resource file to be loaded by all applications.	If this vari-
	       able is not defined, a file named 4m$HOME24m/.Xdefaults-4mhostname24m is
	       looked for instead, where 4mhostname24m is the name of the host
	       where the application is executing.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       Resources can also be specified from the command line.  The
	       4mresourcestring24m is a single resource name and value as shown
	       above.  Note that if the string contains characters interpreted
	       by the shell (e.g., asterisk), they must be quoted.  Any number
	       of 1m-xrm 22marguments may be given on the command line.

       Program resources are organized into groups called 4mclasses24m, so that
       collections of individual resources (each of which are called
       4minstances24m) can be set all at once.	By convention, the instance name of
       a resource begins with a lowercase letter and class name with an upper
       case letter.  Multiple word resources are concatenated with the first
       letter of the succeeding words capitalized.  Applications written with
       the X Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the following resources:


       1mbackground (22mclass 1mBackground)0m
	       This resource specifies the color to use for the window back-
	       ground.


       1mborderWidth (22mclass 1mBorderWidth)0m
	       This resource specifies the width in pixels of the window bor-
	       der.


       1mborderColor (22mclass 1mBorderColor)0m
	       This resource specifies the color to use for the window border.

       Most applications using the X Toolkit Intrinsics also have the resource
       1mforeground 22m(class 1mForeground22m), specifying the color to use for text and
       graphics within the window.

       By combining class and instance specifications, application preferences
       can be set quickly and easily.  Users of color displays will frequently
       want to set Background and Foreground classes to particular defaults.
       Specific color instances such as text cursors can then be overridden
       without having to define all of the related resources.  For example,

	   bitmap*Dashed:  off
	   XTerm*cursorColor:  gold
	   XTerm*multiScroll:  on
	   XTerm*jumpScroll:  on
	   XTerm*reverseWrap:  on
	   XTerm*curses:  on
	   XTerm*Font:	6x10
	   XTerm*scrollBar: on
	   XTerm*scrollbar*thickness: 5
	   XTerm*multiClickTime: 500
	   XTerm*charClass:  33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48
	   XTerm*cutNewline: off
	   XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off
	   XTerm*titeInhibit:  on
	   XTerm*ttyModes:  intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u
	   XLoad*Background: gold
	   XLoad*Foreground: red
	   XLoad*highlight: black
	   XLoad*borderWidth: 0
	   emacs*Geometry:  80x65-0-0
	   emacs*Background:  rgb:5b/76/86
	   emacs*Foreground:  white
	   emacs*Cursor:  white
	   emacs*BorderColor:  white
	   emacs*Font:	6x10
	   xmag*geometry: -0-0
	   xmag*borderColor:  white

       If these resources were stored in a file called 4m.Xresources24m in your
       home directory, they could be added to any existing resources in the
       server with the following command:

	   % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources

       This is frequently how user-friendly startup scripts merge user-spe-
       cific defaults into any site-wide defaults.  All sites are encouraged
       to set up convenient ways of automatically loading resources. See the
       4mXlib24m manual section 4mResource24m 4mManager24m 4mFunctions24m for more information.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       1mDISPLAY0m
	      This is the only mandatory environment variable. It must point
	      to an X server. See section "Display Names" above.

       1mXAUTHORITY0m
	      This must point to a file that contains authorization data. The
	      default is 4m$HOME/.Xauthority24m. See 1mXsecurity22m(7), 1mxauth22m(1),
	      1mxdm22m(1), 1mXau22m(3).

       1mICEAUTHORITY0m
	      This must point to a file that contains authorization data. The
	      default is 4m$HOME/.ICEauthority24m.

       1mLC_ALL22m, 1mLC_CTYPE22m, 1mLANG0m
	      The first non-empty value among these three determines the cur-
	      rent locale's facet for character handling, and in particular
	      the default text encoding. See 1mlocale22m(7), 1msetlocale22m(3),
	      1mlocale22m(1).

       1mXMODIFIERS0m
	      This variable can be set to contain additional information
	      important for the current locale setting. Typically set to
	      4m@im=<input-method>24m to enable a particular input method. See
	      1mXSetLocaleModifiers22m(3).

       1mXLOCALEDIR0m
	      This must point to a directory containing the locale.alias file
	      and Compose and XLC_LOCALE file hierarchies for all locales. The
	      default value is 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale24m.

       1mXENVIRONMENT0m
	      This must point to a file containing X resources. The default is
	      4m$HOME/.Xdefaults-<hostname>24m. Unlike 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/Xre-0m
	      4msources24m, it is consulted each time an X application starts.

       1mXFILESEARCHPATH0m
	      This must contain a colon separated list of path templates,
	      where libXt will search for resource files. The default value
	      consists of

		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:\
		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:\
		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:\
		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:\
		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:\
		  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/%T/%N%S

	      A path template is transformed to a pathname by substituting:

		  %N => name (basename) being searched for
		  %T => type (dirname) being searched for
		  %S => suffix being searched for
		  %C => value of the resource "customization"
			(class "Customization")
		  %L => the locale name
		  %l => the locale's language (part before '_')
		  %t => the locale's territory (part after '_` but before '.')
		  %c => the locale's encoding (part after '.')

       1mXUSERFILESEARCHPATH0m
	      This must contain a colon separated list of path templates,
	      where libXt will search for user dependent resource files. The
	      default value is:

		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%L/%N%C:\
		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%l/%N%C:\
		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%N%C:\
		  $HOME/%N%C:\
		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%L/%N:\
		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%l/%N:\
		  $XAPPLRESDIR/%N:\
		  $HOME/%N

	      $XAPPLRESDIR defaults to 4m$HOME24m, see below.

	      A path template is transformed to a pathname by substituting:

		  %N => name (basename) being searched for
		  %T => type (dirname) being searched for
		  %S => suffix being searched for
		  %C => value of the resource "customization"
			(class "Customization")
		  %L => the locale name
		  %l => the locale's language (part before '_')
		  %t => the locale's territory (part after '_` but before '.')
		  %c => the locale's encoding (part after '.')

       1mXAPPLRESDIR0m
	      This must point to a base directory where the user stores his
	      application dependent resource files. The default value is
	      4m$HOME24m. Only used if XUSERFILESEARCHPATH is not set.

       1mXKEYSYMDB0m
	      This must point to a file containing nonstandard keysym defini-
	      tions.  The default value is 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB24m.

       1mXCMSDB 22mThis must point to a color name database file. The default value
	      is 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/Xcms.txt24m.

       1mXFT_CONFIG0m
	      This must point to a configuration file for the Xft library. The
	      default value is 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig24m.

       1mRESOURCE_NAME0m
	      This serves as main identifier for resources belonging to the
	      program being executed. It defaults to the basename of pathname
	      of the program.

       1mSESSION_MANAGER0m
	      Denotes the session manager the application should connect. See
	      1mxsm22m(1), 1mrstart22m(1).

       1mXF86BIGFONT_DISABLE0m
	      Setting this variable to a non-empty value disables the
	      XFree86-Bigfont extension. This extension is a mechanism to
	      reduce the memory consumption of big fonts by use of shared mem-
	      ory.

       1mXKB_FORCE0m
       1mXKB_DISABLE0m
       1mXKB_DEBUG0m
       1m_XKB_CHARSET0m
       1m_XKB_LOCALE_CHARSETS0m
       1m_XKB_OPTIONS_ENABLE0m
       1m_XKB_LATIN1_LOOKUP0m
       1m_XKB_CONSUME_LOOKUP_MODS0m
       1m_XKB_CONSUME_SHIFT_AND_LOCK0m
       1m_XKB_IGNORE_NEW_KEYBOARDS0m
       1m_XKB_CONTROL_FALLBACK0m
       1m_XKB_COMP_LED _XKB_COMP_FAIL_BEEP0m

	      These variables influence the X Keyboard Extension.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       A wide variety of error messages are generated from various programs.
       The default error handler in 4mXlib24m (also used by many toolkits) uses
       standard resources to construct diagnostic messages when errors occur.
       The defaults for these messages are usually stored in
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XErrorDB24m.  If this file is not present, error mes-
       sages will be rather terse and cryptic.

       When the X Toolkit Intrinsics encounter errors converting resource
       strings to the appropriate internal format, no error messages are usu-
       ally printed.  This is convenient when it is desirable to have one set
       of resources across a variety of displays (e.g. color vs. monochrome,
       lots of fonts vs. very few, etc.), although it can pose problems for
       trying to determine why an application might be failing.	 This behavior
       can be overridden by the setting the 4mStringConversionsWarning24m resource.

       To force the X Toolkit Intrinsics to always print string conversion
       error messages, the following resource should be placed in the file
       that gets loaded onto the RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the 4mxrdb24m pro-
       gram (frequently called 4m.Xresources24m or 4m.Xres24m in the user's home direc-
       tory):

	   *StringConversionWarnings: on

       To have conversion messages printed for just a particular application,
       the appropriate instance name can be placed before the asterisk:

	   xterm*StringConversionWarnings: on

1mNAME0m
       XStandards - X Consortium Standards and X Project Team Specifications

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       The major goal of the X Consortium was to promote cooperation within
       the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces
       at all layers in the X Window System environment.  The X Consortium
       produced standards - documents which defined network protocols, pro-
       gramming interfaces, and other aspects of the X environment.  These
       standards continue to exist in The Open Group's X Project Team
       releases.  The X Project Team produces specifications.  Like X Consor-
       tium Standards, these are documents which define network protocols,
       programming interfaces, and other aspects of the X environment.	Under
       the aegis of The Open Group, X Consortium standards, X Project Team
       specifications, and other specifications are the basis for portions of
       The Open Group's various CAE specifications.

       The status of various standards, specifications, and the software in
       the X11R6.4 distribution, is explained below.

1mSTANDARDS0m
       The following documents are X Consortium standards:

1mNON STANDARDS0m
       The X11R6.4 distribution contains 4msample24m implementations, not 4mreference0m
       implementations.	 Although much of the code is believed to be correct,
       the code should be assumed to be in error wherever it conflicts with
       the specification.

       The only X Consortium standards are the ones listed above.  No other
       documents, include files, or software in X11R6.4 carry special status
       within the X Consortium.	 For example, none of the following are stan-
       dards: internal interfaces of the sample server; the MIT-SHM extension;
       the Athena Widget Set; the Xmu library; the Xau library; the RGB data-
       base; the X Locale database; the fonts distributed with X11R6.4; the
       applications distributed with X11R6.4; the include files <X11/XWD-
       File.h>, <X11/Xfuncproto.h>, <X11/Xfuncs.h>, <X11/Xosdefs.h>,
       <X11/Xos.h>, <X11/Xos_r.h>, <X11/Xwinsock.h>, and <X11/Xthreads.h>; the
       bitmap files in <X11/bitmaps>.

       The Multi-Buffering extension was a draft standard of the X Consortium
       but has been superseded by DBE as a standard.


1mX REGISTRY0m
       The X Consortium maintained a registry of certain X-related items, to
       aid in avoiding conflicts and to aid in sharing of such items.

       The registry is published as part of the X Consortium software release.
       The latest version may also be available by sending a message to
       xstuff@x.org.  The message can have a subject line and no body, or a
       single-line body and no subject, in either case the line looking like:

       The X Registry and the names in it are not X Consortium standards.

1mNAME0m
       Xsecurity - X display access control

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       X provides mechanism for implementing many access control systems.  The
       sample implementation includes five mechanisms:
	   Host Access			 Simple host-based access control.
	   MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1		 Shared plain-text "cookies".
	   XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1		 Secure DES based private-keys.
	   SUN-DES-1			 Based on Sun's secure rpc system.
	   MIT-KERBEROS-5		 Kerberos Version 5 user-to-user.

1mACCESS SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS0m
       Host Access
	      Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
	      access to the X server.  This system can work reasonably well in
	      an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a
	      single person can log in to a given machine, and is easy to use
	      when the list of hosts used is small.  This system does not work
	      well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and
	      mutual trust does not exist.  The list of allowed hosts is
	      stored in the X server and can be changed with the 4mxhost24m com-
	      mand.  When using the more secure mechanisms listed below, the
	      host list is normally configured to be the empty list, so that
	      only authorized programs can connect to the display.

       MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
	      When using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, the client sends a 128 bit
	      "cookie" along with the connection setup information.  If the
	      cookie presented by the client matches one that the X server
	      has, the connection is allowed access.  The cookie is chosen so
	      that it is hard to guess; 4mxdm24m generates such cookies automati-
	      cally when this form of access control is used.  The user's copy
	      of the cookie is usually stored in the 4m.Xauthority24m file in the
	      home directory, although the environment variable 1mXAUTHORITY 22mcan
	      be used to specify an alternate location.	 4mXdm24m automatically
	      passes a cookie to the server for each new login session, and
	      stores the cookie in the user file at login.

	      The cookie is transmitted on the network without encryption, so
	      there is nothing to prevent a network snooper from obtaining the
	      data and using it to gain access to the X server.	 This system
	      is useful in an environment where many users are running appli-
	      cations on the same machine and want to avoid interference from
	      each other, with the caveat that this control is only as good as
	      the access control to the physical network.  In environments
	      where network-level snooping is difficult, this system can work
	      reasonably well.

       XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
	      Sites who compile with DES support can use a DES-based access
	      control mechanism called XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1.  It is similar in
	      usage to MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 in that a key is stored in the 4m.Xau-0m
	      4mthority24m file and is shared with the X server.  However, this key
	      consists of two parts - a 56 bit DES encryption key and 64 bits
	      of random data used as the authenticator.

	      When connecting to the X server, the application generates 192
	      bits of data by combining the current time in seconds (since
	      00:00 1/1/1970 GMT) along with 48 bits of "identifier".  For
	      TCP/IPv4 connections, the identifier is the address plus port
	      number; for local connections it is the process ID and 32 bits
	      to form a unique id (in case multiple connections to the same
	      server are made from a single process).  This 192 bit packet is
	      then encrypted using the DES key and sent to the X server, which
	      is able to verify if the requestor is authorized to connect by
	      decrypting with the same DES key and validating the authentica-
	      tor and additional data.	This system is useful in many environ-
	      ments where host-based access control is inappropriate and where
	      network security cannot be ensured.

       SUN-DES-1
	      Recent versions of SunOS (and some other systems) have included
	      a secure public key remote procedure call system.	 This system
	      is based on the notion of a network principal; a user name and
	      NIS domain pair.	Using this system, the X server can securely
	      discover the actual user name of the requesting process.	It
	      involves encrypting data with the X server's public key, and so
	      the identity of the user who started the X server is needed for
	      this; this identity is stored in the 4m.Xauthority24m file.  By
	      extending the semantics of "host address" to include this notion
	      of network principal, this form of access control is very easy
	      to use.

	      To allow access by a new user, use 4mxhost24m.  For example,
		  xhost keith@ ruth@mit.edu
	      adds "keith" from the NIS domain of the local machine, and
	      "ruth" in the "mit.edu" NIS domain.  For keith or ruth to suc-
	      cessfully connect to the display, they must add the principal
	      who started the server to their 4m.Xauthority24m file.  For example:
		  xauth add expo.lcs.mit.edu:0 SUN-DES-1 unix.expo.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu
	      This system only works on machines which support Secure RPC, and
	      only for users which have set up the appropriate public/private
	      key pairs on their system.  See the Secure RPC documentation for
	      details.	To access the display from a remote host, you may have
	      to do a 4mkeylogin24m on the remote host first.

       MIT-KERBEROS-5
	      Kerberos is a network-based authentication scheme developed by
	      MIT for Project Athena.  It allows mutually suspicious princi-
	      pals to authenticate each other as long as each trusts a third
	      party, Kerberos.	Each principal has a secret key known only to
	      it and Kerberos.	Principals includes servers, such as an FTP
	      server or X server, and human users, whose key is their pass-
	      word.  Users gain access to services by getting Kerberos tickets
	      for those services from a Kerberos server.  Since the X server
	      has no place to store a secret key, it shares keys with the user
	      who logs in.  X authentication thus uses the user-to-user scheme
	      of Kerberos version 5.

	      When you log in via 4mxdm24m, 4mxdm24m will use your password to obtain
	      the initial Kerberos tickets.  4mxdm24m stores the tickets in a cre-
	      dentials cache file and sets the environment variable 4mKRB5CCNAME0m
	      to point to the file.  The credentials cache is destroyed when
	      the session ends to reduce the chance of the tickets being
	      stolen before they expire.

	      Since Kerberos is a user-based authorization protocol, like the
	      SUN-DES-1 protocol, the owner of a display can enable and dis-
	      able specific users, or Kerberos principals.  The 4mxhost24m client
	      is used to enable or disable authorization.  For example,
		  xhost krb5:judy krb5:gildea@x.org
	      adds "judy" from the Kerberos realm of the local machine, and
	      "gildea" from the "x.org" realm.

1mTHE AUTHORIZATION FILE0m
       Except for Host Access control, each of these systems uses data stored
       in the 4m.Xauthority24m file to generate the correct authorization informa-
       tion to pass along to the X server at connection setup.	MIT-MAGIC-
       COOKIE-1 and XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 store secret data in the file; so any-
       one who can read the file can gain access to the X server.  SUN-DES-1
       stores only the identity of the principal who started the server
       (unix.4mhostname24m@4mdomain24m when the server is started by 4mxdm24m), and so it is
       not useful to anyone not authorized to connect to the server.

       Each entry in the 4m.Xauthority24m file matches a certain connection family
       (TCP/IP, DECnet or local connections) and X display name (hostname plus
       display number).	 This allows multiple authorization entries for dif-
       ferent displays to share the same data file.  A special connection fam-
       ily (FamilyWild, value 65535) causes an entry to match every display,
       allowing the entry to be used for all connections.  Each entry addi-
       tionally contains the authorization name and whatever private autho-
       rization data is needed by that authorization type to generate the cor-
       rect information at connection setup time.

       The 4mxauth24m program manipulates the 4m.Xauthority24m file format.  It under-
       stands the semantics of the connection families and address formats,
       displaying them in an easy to understand format.	 It also understands
       that SUN-DES-1 and MIT-KERBEROS-5 use string values for the authoriza-
       tion data, and displays them appropriately.

       The X server (when running on a workstation) reads authorization infor-
       mation from a file name passed on the command line with the 4m-auth0m
       option (see the 4mXserver24m manual page).  The authorization entries in the
       file are used to control access to the server.  In each of the autho-
       rization schemes listed above, the data needed by the server to ini-
       tialize an authorization scheme is identical to the data needed by the
       client to generate the appropriate authorization information, so the
       same file can be used by both processes.	 This is especially useful
       when 4mxinit24m is used.

       MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
	      This system uses 128 bits of data shared between the user and
	      the X server.  Any collection of bits can be used.  4mXdm24m gener-
	      ates these keys using a cryptographically secure pseudo random
	      number generator, and so the key to the next session cannot be
	      computed from the current session key.

       XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
	      This system uses two pieces of information.  First, 64 bits of
	      random data, second a 56 bit DES encryption key (again, random
	      data) stored in 8 bytes, the last byte of which is ignored.  4mXdm0m
	      generates these keys using the same random number generator as
	      is used for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.

       SUN-DES-1
	      This system needs a string representation of the principal which
	      identifies the associated X server.  This information is used to
	      encrypt the client's authority information when it is sent to
	      the X server.  When 4mxdm24m starts the X server, it uses the root
	      principal for the machine on which it is running (unix.4mhost-0m
	      4mname24m@4mdomain24m, e.g., "unix.expire.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu").
	      Putting the correct principal name in the 4m.Xauthority24m file
	      causes Xlib to generate the appropriate authorization informa-
	      tion using the secure RPC library.

       MIT-KERBEROS-5
	      Kerberos reads tickets from the cache pointed to by the
	      4mKRB5CCNAME24m environment variable, so does not use any data from
	      the 4m.Xauthority24m file.  An entry with no data must still exist to
	      tell clients that MIT-KERBEROS-5 is available.

	      Unlike the 4m.Xauthority24m file for clients, the authority file
	      passed by xdm to a local X server (with ``1m-auth 4m22mfilename24m'', see
	      xdm(1)) does contain the name of the credentials cache, since
	      the X server will not have the 4mKRB5CCNAME24m environment variable
	      set.  The data of the MIT-KERBEROS-5 entry is the credentials
	      cache name and has the form ``UU:FILE:4mfilename24m'', where 4mfilename0m
	      is the name of the credentials cache file created by xdm.	 Note
	      again that this form is 4mnot24m used by clients.

1mNAME0m
       appres - list X application resource database

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mappres 22m[[class [instance]] [-1] [toolkitoptions]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mappres24m program prints the resources seen by an application (or sub-
       hierarchy of an application) with the specified 4mclass24m and 4minstance0m
       names.  It can be used to determine which resources a particular pro-
       gram will load.	For example,

	    % appres  XTerm

       will list the resources that any 4mxterm24m program will load.  If no appli-
       cation class is specified, the class 4m-AppResTest-24m is used.

       To match a particular instance name, specify an instance name explic-
       itly after the class name, or use the normal Xt toolkit option.	For
       example,

	    % appres  XTerm  myxterm
       or
	    % appres  XTerm  -name  myxterm

       To list resources that match a subhierarchy of an application, specify
       hierarchical class and instance names.  The number of class and
       instance components must be equal, and the instance name should not be
       specified with a toolkit option.	 For example,

	    % appres  Xman.TopLevelShell.Form  xman.topBox.form

       will list the resources of widgets of 4mxman24m topBox hierarchy.  To list
       just the resources matching a specific level in the hierarchy, use the
       -1 option.  For example,

	    % appres  XTerm.VT100  xterm.vt100	-1

       will list the resources matching the 4mxterm24m vt100 widget.

1mNAME0m
       bdftopcf - convert X font from Bitmap Distribution Format to Portable
       Compiled Format

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mbdftopcf 22m[ 1m-p4m22mn24m ] [ 1m-u4m22mn24m ] [ 1m-m 22m] [ 1m-l 22m] [ 1m-M 22m] [ 1m-L 22m] [ 1m-t 22m] [ 1m-i 22m] [ 1m-o0m
       4moutputfile24m ] fontfile.bdf

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mBdftopcf24m is a font compiler for the X server and font server.  Fonts in
       Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture, although the
       file is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them
       directly without reformatting.  This allows fast reading on the appro-
       priate machine, but the files are still portable (but read more slowly)
       on other machines.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-p4m22mn24m	 Sets the font glyph padding.  Each glyph in the font will have
	       each scanline padded in to a multiple of 4mn24m bytes, where 4mn24m is 1,
	       2, 4 or 8.

       1m-u4m22mn24m	 Sets the font scanline unit.  When the font bit order is dif-
	       ferent from the font byte order, the scanline unit 4mn24m describes
	       what unit of data (in bytes) are to be swapped; the unit 4mi24m can
	       be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

       1m-m	 22mSets the font bit order to MSB (most significant bit) first.
	       Bits for each glyph will be placed in this order; i.e., the
	       left most bit on the screen will be in the highest valued bit
	       in each unit.

       1m-l	 22mSets the font bit order to LSB (least significant bit) first.
	       The left most bit on the screen will be in the lowest valued
	       bit in each unit.

       1m-M	 22mSets the font byte order to MSB first.  All multi-byte data in
	       the file (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will be written
	       most significant byte first.

       1m-L	 22mSets the font byte order to LSB first.  All multi-byte data in
	       the file (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will be written
	       least significant byte first.

       1m-t	 22mWhen this option is specified, 4mbdftopcf24m will convert fonts into
	       "terminal" fonts when possible.	A terminal font has each glyph
	       image padded to the same size; the X server can usually render
	       these types of fonts more quickly.

       1m-i	 22mThis option inhibits the normal computation of ink metrics.
	       When a font has glyph images which do not fill the bitmap image
	       (i.e., the "on" pixels don't extend to the edges of the met-
	       rics) 4mbdftopcf24m computes the actual ink metrics and places them
	       in the .pcf file; the -t option inhibits this behaviour.

       1m-o 4m22moutput-file-name0m
	       By default 4mbdftopcf24m writes the pcf file to standard output;
	       this option gives the name of a file to be used instead.

       ] [ 4mfilename24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mbitmap24m program is a rudimentary tool for creating or editing rect-
       angular images made up of 1's and 0's.  Bitmaps are used in X for
       defining clipping regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and tile and
       stipple patterns.

       The 4mbmtoa24m and 4matobm24m filters convert 4mbitmap24m files (FILE FORMAT) to and
       from ASCII strings.  They are most commonly used to quickly print out
       bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.

1mCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS0m
       4mBitmap24m supports the standard X Toolkit command line arguments (see
       4mX24m(1)).  The following additional arguments are supported as well.

       1m-size 4m22mWIDTHxHEIGHT0m
	   Specifies size of the grid in squares.

       1m-sw 4m22mdimension0m
	   Specifies the width of squares in pixels.

       1m-sh 4m22mdimension0m
	   Specifies the height of squares in pixels.

       1m-gt 4m22mdimension0m
	   Grid tolerance.  If the square dimensions fall below the specified
	   value, grid will be automatically turned off.

       1m-grid, +grid0m
	   Turns on or off the grid lines.

       1m-axes, +axes0m
	   Turns on or off the major axes.

       1m-dashed, +dashed0m
	   Turns on or off dashing for the frame and grid lines.

       1m-stippled, +stippled0m
	   Turns on or off stippling of highlighted squares.

       1m-proportional, +proportional0m
	   Turns proportional mode on or off.  If proportional mode is on,
	   square width is equal to square height.  If proportional mode is
	   off, 4mbitmap24m will use the smaller square dimension, if they were
	   initially different.

       1m-dashes 4m22mfilename0m
	   Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for dashing.

       1m-stipple 4m22mfilename0m
	   Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for highlighting.

       1m-hl 4m22mcolor0m
	   Specifies the color used for highlighting.

       1m-fr 4m22mcolor0m
	   Specifies the color used for the frame and grid lines.

       1mfilename0m
	   Specifies the bitmap to be initially loaded into the program.  If
	   the file does not exist, 4mbitmap24m will assume it is a new file.

       1mbasename0m
	   Specifies the basename to be used in the C code output file.	 If it
	   is different than the basename in the working file, 4mbitmap24m will
	   change it when saving the file.

       4mBmtoa24m accepts the following option:

       1m-chars 4m22mcc0m
	   This option specifies the pair of characters to use in the string
	   version of the bitmap.  The first character is used for 0 bits and
	   the second character is used for 1 bits.  The default is to use
	   dashes (-) for 0's and sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       4mAtobm24m accepts the following options:

       1m-chars 4m22mcc0m
	   This option specifies the pair of characters to use when converting
	   string bitmaps into arrays of numbers.  The first character repre-
	   sents a 0 bit and the second character represents a 1 bit.  The
	   default is to use dashes (-) for 0's and sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       1m-name 4m22mvariable0m
	   This option specifies the variable name to be used when writing out
	   the bitmap file.  The default is to use the basename of the 4mfile-0m
	   4mname24m command line argument or leave it blank if the standard input
	   is read.

       1m-xhot 4m22mnumber0m
	   This option specifies the X coordinate of the hotspot.  Only posi-
	   tive values are allowed.  By default, no hotspot information is
	   included.

       1m-yhot 4m22mnumber0m
	   This option specifies the Y coordinate of the hotspot.  Only posi-
	   tive values are allowed.  By default, no hotspot information is
	   included.

1mUSAGE0m
       4mBitmap24m displays grid in which each square represents a single bit in
       the picture being edited.  Actual size of the bitmap image, as it would
       appear normaly and inverted, can be obtained by pressing 1mMeta-I 22mkey.
       You are free to move the image popup out of the way to continue edit-
       ing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the popup window or 1mMeta-I0m
       again will remove the real size bitmap image.

       If the bitmap is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares
       in the images may be designated as the hot spot.	 This determines where
       the cursor is actually pointing.	 For cursors with sharp tips (such as
       arrows or fingers), this is usually at the end of the tip; for symmet-
       ric cursors (such as crosses or bullseyes), this is usually at the cen-
       ter.

       Bitmaps are stored as small C code fragments suitable for including in
       applications.  They provide an array of bits as well as symbolic con-
       stants giving the width, height, and hot spot (if specified) that may
       be used in creating cursors, icons, and tiles.

1mEDITING0m
       To edit a bitmap image simply click on one of the buttons with drawing
       commands (1mPoint, Curve, Line, Rectangle, 22metc.) and move the pointer
       into the bitmap grid  window.  Press one of the buttons on your mouse
       and the appropriate action will take place.  You can either set, clear
       or invert the gird squares.  Setting a grid square corresponds to set-
       ting a bit in the bitmap image to 1.  Clearing a grid square corre-
       sponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0.  Inverting a grid
       square corresponds to changing a bit in the bitmap image from 0 to 1 or
       1 to 0, depending what its previous state was. The default behavior of
       mouse buttons is as specified below.

		 MouseButton1	     Set
		 MouseButton2	     Invert
		 MouseButton3	     Clear
		 MouseButton4	     Clear
		 MouseButton5	     Clear

       This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function
       resources.  An example is provided below.

		 bitmap*button1Function: Set
		 bitmap*button2Function: Clear
		 bitmap*button3Function: Invert
		 etc.

       The button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying,
       moving and pasting, flood filling and setting the hot spot.

1mDRAWING COMMANDS0m
       Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the buttons at
       the left side of the application's window.  Some commands can be
       aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the user to
       select different guiding points where applicable.

       1mClear0m
	   This command clears all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares
	   will be set to the background color.	 Pressing C inside the bitmap
	   window has the same effect.

       1mSet 22mThis command sets all bits in the bitmap image.	 The grid squares
	   will be set to the foreground color.	 Pressing S inside the bitmap
	   window has the same effect.

       1mInvert0m
	   This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid
	   squares will be inverted appropriately.  Pressing I inside the bit-
	   map window has the same effect.

       1mMark0m
	   This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging out a
	   rectangular shape in the highlighting color.	 Once the area is
	   marked, it can be operated on by a number of commands (see 1mUp,0m
	   1mDown, Left, Right, Rotate, Flip, Cut, 22metc.)  Only one marked area
	   can be present at any time.	If you attempt to mark another area,
	   the old mark will vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by
	   pressing 1mShift-MouseButton1 22mand dragging out a rectangle in the
	   grid window.	 Pressing 1mShift-MouseButton2 22mwill mark the entire grid
	   area.

       1mUnmark0m
	   This command will cause the marked area to vanish.  The same effect
	   can be achieved by pressing 1mShift-MouseButton322m.

       1mCopy0m
	   This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location
	   to another.	If there is no marked grid area displayed, 1mCopy0m
	   behaves just like 1mMark 22mdescribed above.	 Once there is a marked
	   grid area displayed in the highlighting color, this command has two
	   alternative behaviors.  If you click a mouse button inside the
	   marked area, you will be able to drag the rectangle that represents
	   the marked area to the desired location.  After you release the
	   mouse button, the area will be copied.  If you click outside the
	   marked area, 1mCopy 22mwill assume that you wish to mark a different
	   region of the bitmap image, thus it will behave like 1mMark 22magain.

       1mMove0m
	   This command is used to move an area of the grid from one location
	   to another.	Its behavior resembles the behavior of 1mCopy 22mcommand,
	   except that the marked area will be moved instead of copied.

       1mFlip Horizontally0m
	   This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the hori-
	   zontal axes.	 If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will
	   operate only inside the marked area.	 Pressing H inside the bitmap
	   window has the same effect.

       1mUp  22mThis command moves the bitmap image one pixel up.  If a marked area
	   of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked
	   area.  Pressing UpArrow inside the bitmap window has the same
	   effect.

       1mFlip Vertically0m
	   This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the verti-
	   cal axes.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will
	   operate only inside the marked area.	 Pressing V inside the bitmap
	   window has the same effect.

       1mLeft0m
	   This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the left.  If a
	   marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside
	   the marked area.  Pressing LeftArrow inside the bitmap window has
	   the same effect.

       1mFold0m
	   This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite cor-
	   ners become adjacent.  This is useful when creating bitmap images
	   for tiling.	Pressing F inside the bitmap window has the same
	   effect.

       1mRight0m
	   This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right.	If a
	   marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside
	   the marked area.  Pressing RightArrow inside the bitmap window has
	   the same effect.

       1mRotate Left0m
	   This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left
	   (counter clockwise.)	 If a marked area of the grid is highlighted,
	   it will operate only inside the marked area.	 Pressing L inside the
	   bitmap window has the same effect.

       1mDown0m
	   This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down.	If a marked
	   area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the
	   marked area.	 Pressing DownArrow inside the bitmap window has the
	   same effect.

       1mRotate Right0m
	   This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right
	   (clockwise.)	 If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will
	   operate only inside the marked area.	 Pressing R inside the bitmap
	   window has the same effect.

       1mPoint0m
	   This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse
	   pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the
	   mouse button continuously, the line may not be continuous, depend-
	   ing on the speed of your system and frequency of mouse motion
	   events.

       1mCurve0m
	   This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse
	   pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the
	   mouse button continuously, it will make sure that the line is con-
	   tinuous.  If your system is slow or 4mbitmap24m receives very few mouse
	   motion events, it might behave quite strangely.

       1mLine0m
	   This command will change the gird squares in a line between two
	   squares.  Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, 4mbitmap0m
	   will highlight the line from the square where the mouse button was
	   initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.
	   By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change to take
	   effect, and the highlighted line will disappear.

       1mRectangle0m
	   This command will change the gird squares in a rectangle between
	   two squares.	 Once you press a mouse button in the grid window,
	   4mbitmap24m will highlight the rectangle from the square where the mouse
	   button was initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer
	   is located.	By releasing the mouse button you will cause the
	   change to take effect, and the highlighted rectangle will disap-
	   pear.

       1mFilled Rectangle0m
	   This command is identical to 1mRectangle22m, except at the end the rec-
	   tangle will be filled rather than outlined.

       1mCircle0m
	   This command will change the gird squares in a circle between two
	   squares.  Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, 4mbitmap0m
	   will highlight the circle from the square where the mouse button
	   was initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is
	   located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change
	   to take effect, and the highlighted circle will disappear.

       1mFilled Circle0m
	   This command is identical to 1mCircle22m, except at the end the circle
	   will be filled rather than outlined.

       1mFlood Fill0m
	   This command will flood fill the connected area underneath the
	   mouse pointer when you click on the desired square.	Diagonally
	   adjacent squares are not considered to be connected.

       1mSet Hot Spot0m
	   This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if
	   this bitmap image is to be used for defining a cursor.  Pressing a
	   mouse button in the desired square will cause a diamond shape to be
	   displayed.

       1mClear Hot Spot0m
	   This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.

       1mUndo0m
	   This command will undo the last executed command.  It has depth
	   one, that is, pressing 1mUndo 22mafter 1mUndo 22mwill undo itself.

1mFILE MENU0m
       The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and
       selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Ctrl key with
       another key.  These commands deal with files and global bitmap parame-
       ters, such as size, basename, filename etc.

       1mNew 22mThis command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of
	   the new file to be edited.  It will not load in the new file.

       1mLoad0m
	   This command is used to load a new bitmap file into the bitmap edi-
	   tor.	 If the current image has not been saved, user will be asked
	   whether to save or ignore the changes.  The editor can edit only
	   one file at a time.	If you need interactive editing, run a number
	   of editors and use cut and paste mechanism as described below.

       1mInsert0m
	   This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image being
	   currently edited.  After being prompted for the filename, click
	   inside the grid window and drag the outlined rectangle to the loca-
	   tion where you want to insert the new file.

       1mSave0m
	   This command will save the bitmap image.  It will not prompt for
	   the filename unless it is said to be <none>.	 If you leave the
	   filename undesignated or -, the output will be piped to stdout.

       1mSave As0m
	   This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new
	   filename.  It should be used if you want to change the filename.

       1mResize0m
	   This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number
	   of pixels.  The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.
	   The information in the image being edited will not be lost unless
	   the new size is smaller that the current image size. The editor was
	   not designed to edit huge files.

       1mRescale0m
	   This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new width
	   and height.	The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.
	   It will not do antialiasing and information will be lost if you
	   rescale to the smaller sizes.  Feel free to add you own algorithms
	   for better rescaling.

       1mFilename0m
	   This command is used to change the filename without changing the
	   basename nor saving the file.  If you specify - for a filename, the
	   output will be piped to stdout.

       1mBasename0m
	   This command is used to change the basename, if a different one
	   from the specified filename is desired.

       1mQuit0m
	   This command will terminate the bitmap application.	If the file
	   was not saved, user will be prompted and asked whether to save the
	   image or not.  This command is preferred over killing the process.

1mEDIT MENU0m
       The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and
       selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Meta key with
       another key.  These commands deal with editing facilities such as grid,
       axes, zooming, cut and paste, etc.

       1mImage0m
	   This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in
	   its actual size in a separate window.  The window can be moved away
	   to continue with editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the
	   image window will cause it to disappear from the screen.

       1mGrid0m
	   This command controls the grid in the editing area.	If the grid
	   spacing is below the value specified by gridTolerance resource (8
	   by default), the grid will be automatically turned off.  It can be
	   enforced by explicitly activating this command.

       1mDashed0m
	   This command controls the stipple for drawing the grid lines.  The
	   stipple specified by dashes resource can be turned on or off by
	   activating this command.

       1mAxes0m
	   This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the
	   image being edited.	The actual lines are not part of the image.
	   They are provided to aid user when constructing symmetrical images,
	   or whenever having the main axes highlighted helps your editing.

       1mStippled0m
	   This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas of the
	   bitmap image.  The stipple specified by stipple resource can be
	   turned on or off by activating this command.

       1mProportional0m
	   This command controls the proportional mode.	 If the proportional
	   mode is on, width and height of all image squares are forced to be
	   equal, regardless of the proportions of the bitmap window.

       1mZoom0m
	   This command controls the zoom mode.	 If there is a marked area of
	   the image already displayed, bitmap will automatically zoom into
	   it.	Otherwise, user will have to highlight an area to be edited in
	   the zoom mode and bitmap will automatically switch into it.	One
	   can use all the editing commands and other utilities in the zoom
	   mode.  When you zoom out, undo command will undo the whole zoom
	   session.

       1mCut 22mThis commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into
	   the internal cut and paste buffer.

       1mCopy0m
	   This command copies the contents of the highlighted image area into
	   the internal cut and paste buffer.

       1mPaste0m
	   This command will check if there are any other bitmap applications
	   with a highlighted image area, or if there is something in the
	   internal cut and paste buffer and copy it to the image.  To place
	   the copied image, click in the editing window and drag the outlined
	   image to the position where you want to place i, and then release
	   the button.

1mCUT AND PASTE0m
       Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and
       paste and the global X selection cut and paste.	The internal cut and
       paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also
       cut and copy commands from the edit menu.  The global X selection cut
       and paste is used whenever there is a highlighted area of a bitmap
       image displayed anywhere on the screen.	To copy a part of image from
       another bitmap editor simply highlight the desired area by using the
       Mark command or pressing the shift key and dragging the area with the
       left mouse button.  When the selected area becomes highlighted, any
       other applications (such as xterm, etc.) that use primary selection
       will discard their selection values and unhighlight the appropriate
       information.  Now, use the Paste command for the Edit menu or control
       mouse button to copy the selected part of image into another (or the
       same) bitmap application.  If you attempt to do this without a visible
       highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the internal cut
       and paste buffer and paste whatever was there stored at the moment.

1mCOLORS0m
       If you would like bitmap to be viewable in color, include the following
       in the #ifdef COLOR section of the file you read with xrdb:

       *customization:		       -color

       This will cause bitmap to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
       customization file:

	   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Bitmap-color


1mBITMAP WIDGET0m
       Bitmap widget is a stand-alone widget for editing raster images.	 It is
       not designed to edit large images, although it may be used in that pur-
       pose as well.  It can be freely incorporated with other applications
       and used as a standard editing tool.  The following are the resources
       provided by the bitmap widget.

ccmakedep(1)							  ccmakedep(1)



1mNAME0m
       ccmakedep - create dependencies in makefiles using a C compiler

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mccmakedep 22m[ 1mcpp-flags 22m] [ 1m-w4m22mwidth24m ] [ 1m-s4m22mmagic-string24m ] [ 1m-f4m22mmakefile24m ] [
       1m-o4m22mobject-suffix24m ] [ 1m-v 22m] [ 1m-a 22m] [ 1m-cc4m22mcompiler24m ] [ -- 4moptions24m -- ]
       4msourcefile24m ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mccmakedep 22mprogram calls a C compiler to preprocess each 4msourcefile24m,
       and uses the output to construct 4mmakefile24m rules describing their depen-
       dencies.	 These rules instruct 1mmake22m(1) on which object files must be
       recompiled when a dependency has changed.

       By default, 1mccmakedep 22mplaces its output in the file named 4mmakefile24m if
       it exists, otherwise 4mMakefile.24m  An alternate makefile may be specified
       with the 1m-f 22moption.	 It first searches the makefile for a line begin-
       ning with

	   # DO NOT DELETE

       or one provided with the 1m-s 22moption, as a delimiter for the dependency
       output.	If it finds it, it will delete everything following this up to
       the end of the makefile and put the output after this line.  If it
       doesn't find it, the program will append the string to the makefile and
       place the output after that.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       Normally, 1mccmakedep 22mwill be used in a makefile target so that typing
       'make depend' will bring the dependencies up to date for the makefile.
       For example,
	   SRCS = file1.c file2.c ...
	   CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz
	   depend:
		   ccmakedep -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)

1mOPTIONS0m
       The program will ignore any option that it does not understand, so you
       may use the same arguments that you would for 1mcc22m(1), including 1m-D 22mand
       1m-U 22moptions to define and undefine symbols and 1m-I 22mto set the include
       path.

       1m-a	22mAppend the dependencies to the file instead of replacing exist-
	      ing dependencies.

       1m-cc4m22mcompiler0m
	      Use this compiler to generate dependencies.

       1m-f4m22mmakefile0m
	      Filename.	 This allows you to specify an alternate makefile in
	      which 1mccmakedep 22mcan place its output.  Specifying "-" as the
	      file name (that is, 1m-f-22m) sends the output to standard output
	      instead of modifying an existing file.

       1m-s4m22mstring0m
	      Starting string delimiter.  This option permits you to specify a
	      different string for 1mccmakedep 22mto look for in the makefile.	The
	      default is "# DO NOT DELETE".

       1m-v	22mBe verbose: display the C compiler command before running it.

       1m-- 4m22moptions24m 1m--0m
	      If 1mccmakedep 22mencounters a double hyphen (--) in the argument
	      list, then any unrecognized arguments following it will be
	      silently ignored.	 A second double hyphen terminates this spe-
	      cial treatment.  In this way, 1mccmakedep 22mcan be made to safely
	      ignore esoteric compiler arguments that might normally be found
	      in a CFLAGS 1mmake 22mmacro (see the 1mEXAMPLE 22msection above).	 1m-D22m, 1m-I22m,
	      and 1m-U 22moptions appearing between the pair of double hyphens are
	      still processed normally.

cleanlinks(1)							 cleanlinks(1)



1mNAME0m
       cleanlinks - remove dangling symbolic links and empty directories

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mcleanlinks0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mcleanlinks24m program searches the directory tree descended from the
       current directory for symbolic links whose targets do not exist, and
       removes them.  It then removes all empty directories in that directory
       tree.

       4mcleanlinks24m is useful for cleaning up a shadow link tree created with
       1mlndir22m(1) after files have been removed from the real directory.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       A message will be printed upon encountering each dangling symlink and
       empty directory.

CONSTYPE(1)							   CONSTYPE(1)



1mNAME0m
       constype - print type of Sun console

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mconstype 22m[ 4mdevice_name24m ] [ 1m-num 22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mconstype24m program writes on the standard output the Sun code for the
       type of display that the console is.  The types output include these:


	    bw?	 Black and White, where ? is 1-4. (eg) 3-50s are bw2
	    cg?	 Colour Graphics display, where ? is 1-4
	    gp?	 Optional Graphics Processor board, where ? is 1-2
	    ns?	 Not Sun display -- where ? is A-J


       This is useful in determining startup values and defaults for window
       systems.

       The 4mdevice_name24m argument, if given, is the device to examine.  If not
       given, 4m/dev/fb24m is used.

       The 1m-num 22moption causes 4mconstype24m to follow the type keyword with the
       numeric value of that type, as returned by the FBIOGATTR or FBIOGTYPE
       ioctl and defined in fbio.h.  This is useful if the type is not recog-
       nized by the program.

1mEXIT STATUS0m
       The program exits with status 0 if it identified a known console type,
       1 if the type was unknown, and 2 if the device could not be opened or
       another error occurred.

1mBUGS0m

CXPM(1)								       CXPM(1)

       cxpm - Check an XPM (X PixMap) file - XPM 1, 2, or 3.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mcxpm 22m[4mfilename24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mcxpm 22mprogram can be used to check the format of any XPM (version 1,
       2, or 3) file. On error, unlike 1msxpm22m, 1mcxpm 22mprints out an error	 message
       indicating where the parser choked. This should help finding out what's
       wrong with an XPM file but do not expect too much from it though.  This
       is  not even close from being some kind of lint program for XPM. First,
       it stops at the first error it encounters - so several  fix  and	 retry
       cycles may be necessary to get your file to parse successfully. Second,
       1mcxpm 22monly cares about the format. If, for instance,	 your  pixmap  uses
       too  many  colors for your system you still may experience difficulties
       displaying it. Be warned.

       When no 4mfilename24m is given 1mcxpm 22mreads from the standard input.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mdpsexec  22m[	1m-display  4m22mname24m  ][  1m-sync 22m][ 1m-backup 22m][ 1m-noexec 22m][ 1m-root 22m][
       1m-drawable 4m22mwindowId24m ][ 1m-height 4m22mn24m ][ 1m-width 4m22mn24m ]


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mdpsexec 22mis a Display PostScript program that allows the user to  inter-
       act  directly  with the PostScript interpreter through a command inter-
       face.  1mdpsexec 22mreads lines of text from standard input and passes  each
       line  to the PostScript interpreter for execution.  It creates a window
       that displays the results of graphics operations as they are  executed.
       1mdpsexec  22mexits  when  end of file is reached on standard input, or when
       the user types "quit<return>", which executes the PostScript 1mquit 22moper-
       ator.

       By  default,  1mdpsexec 22mexecutes the PostScript 1mexecutive 22moperator before
       it accepts any user input.  This operator puts  the  PostScript	inter-
       preter in "interactive executive" mode so that the user can control the
       interpreter directly.  In this mode, the	 PostScript  interpreter  sup-
       ports  certain  line-editing  functions and prompts the user when it is
       ready to execute more input.  See section 2.4.4, "Using the Interpreter
       Interactively,"	of  the	 4mPostScript24m  4mLanguage24m 4mReference24m 4mManual,24m 4mSecond0m
       4mEdition,24m for detailed information on this mode of operation.


1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mname0m
	      specifies the display on which to open a connection to the  Dis-
	      play  PostScript system. If no display is specified, the DISPLAY
	      environment variable is used.

       1m-sync	22mestablishes a synchronous connection with the specified  X  dis-
	      play.

       1m-backup0m
	      uses  backing  store  for	 the window in which graphics are dis-
	      played, if possible.  This is generally only effective with  the
	      DPS NX system.

       1m-noexec0m
	      prevents	1mdpsexec  22mfrom  entering  "interactive executive" mode.
	      The primary effect of this option is to inhibit printing the 1mPS>0m
	      prompt  before  each  line of input is accepted.	This option is
	      useful when 1mdpsexec 22mis run with standard input redirected from a
	      file or a pipe.

       1m-root	22mtells  1mdpsexec  22mto  draw  into the root window instead of into a
	      window that it creates.

       1m-drawable 4m22mwindowId0m
	      tells 1mdpsexec 22mto draw into the specified window instead of  into
	      a window that it creates.

       1m-height 4m22mn0m
	      sets the height of the created window.

       1m-width 4m22mn0m
	      sets the width of the created window.


1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       PostScript language error messages are printed to standard output.

EDITRES(1)							    EDITRES(1)



1mNAME0m
       editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications

1mSYNTAX0m
       1meditres 22m[ 4m-toolkitoption24m ... ]

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mEditres24m accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see
       4mX(7)24m).  The order of the command line options is not important.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Editres is a tool that allows users and application developers to  view
       the  full widget hierarchy of any X Toolkit application that speaks the
       Editres protocol.  In addition, editres will help  the  user  construct
       resource	 specifications,  allow	 the user to apply the resource to the
       application and view the results dynamically.  Once the user  is	 happy
       with  a	resource specification editres will append the resource string
       to the user's X Resources file.

1mUSING EDITRES0m
       4mEditres24m provides a window consisting of the following four areas:

       Menu Bar			A set of  popup	 menus	that  allow  you  full
				access to editres's features.

       Panner			The  panner  allows  a	more  intuitive way to
				scroll the application tree display.

       Message Area		Displays information to	 the  user  about  the
				action that editres expects of her.

       Application Widget Tree	This area will be used to display the selected
				application's widget tree.

       To begin an editres session select the 1mGet Widget Tree 22mmenu	 item  from
       the  command  menu.  This will change the pointer cursor to cross hair.
       You should now select the application you wish look at by  clicking  on
       any of its windows.  If this application understands the editres proto-
       col then editres will display the application's widget tree in its tree
       window.	 If  the  application does not understand the editres protocol
       editres will inform you of this fact in the message area	 after	a  few
       seconds delay.

       Once  you  have	a widget tree you may now select any of the other menu
       options. The effect of each of these is described below.

1mCOMMANDS0m
       Get Widget Tree
	       Allows the user to click on any	application  that  speaks  the
	       editres protocol and receive its widget tree.

       Refresh Current Widget Tree
	       Editres	only knows about the widgets that exist at the present
	       time.  Many applications create and destroy widgets on the fly.
	       Selecting this menu item will cause editres to ask the applica-
	       tion to resend its widget tree, thus updating  its  information
	       to the new state of the application.

	       For  example, xman only creates the widgets for its 4mtopbox24m when
	       it starts up.  None of the widgets for the manual  page	window
	       are  created  until the user actually clicks on the 4mManual24m 4mPage0m
	       button.	If you retrieved xman's widget	tree  before  the  the
	       manual  page is active, you may wish to refresh the widget tree
	       after the manual page has been displayed.  This will allow  you
	       to also edit the manual page's resources.

       Dump Widget Tree to a File
	       For  documenting	 applications it is often useful to be able to
	       dump the entire application widget tree to an ASCII file.  This
	       file  can  then be included in the manual page.	When this menu
	       item is selected a popup dialog is activated.  Type the name of
	       the file in this dialog, and either select 4mokay24m, or type a car-
	       riage-return.  Editres will now dump the widget	tree  to  this
	       file.  To cancel the file dialog, select the 4mcancel24m button.

       Show Resource Box
	       This command will popup a resource box for the current applica-
	       tion.  This resource box (described in detail below) will allow
	       the user to see exactly which resources can be set for the wid-
	       get that is currently selected  in  the	widget	tree  display.
	       Only  one widget may be currently selected; if greater or fewer
	       are selected editres will refuse to pop up the resource box and
	       put an error message in the 1mMessage Area22m.

       Set Resource
	       This  command  will  popup  a  simple dialog box for setting an
	       arbitrary resource on all selected widgets.  You must  type  in
	       the  resource  name, as well as the value.  You can use the Tab
	       key to switch between the  resource  name  field	 the  resource
	       value field.

       Quit    Exits editres.

1mTREE COMMANDS0m
       The  1mTree  22mmenu  contains  several commands that allow operations to be
       performed on the widget tree.

       Select Widget in Client
	      This menu item allows you to select any widget in	 the  applica-
	      tion;  editres will then highlight the corresponding element the
	      widget tree display.   Once  this	 menu  item  is	 selected  the
	      pointer  cursor  will  again  turn  to a crosshair, and you must
	      click any pointer button in the widget you  wish	to  have  dis-
	      played.	Since  some  widgets are fully obscured by their chil-
	      dren, it is not possible to get to every widget  this  way,  but
	      this  mechanism  does give very useful feedback between the ele-
	      ments in the widget tree and those in the actual application.

       Select All
       Unselect All
       Invert All
	      These functions allow the user to select,	 unselect,  or	invert
	      all widgets in the widget tree.

       Select Children
       Select Parents
	      These  functions select the immediate parent or children of each
	      of the currently selected widgets.

       Select Descendants
       Select Ancestors
	      These functions select all parents or children of	 each  of  the
	      currently selected widgets.  This is a recursive search.

       Show Widget Names
       Show Class Names
       Show Widget Windows
	      When  the	 tree widget is initially displayed the labels of each
	      widget in the tree correspond to the widget names.  These	 func-
	      tions  will  cause  the  label  of 1mall 22mwidgets in the tree to be
	      changed to show the class name, IDs, or window  associated  with
	      each widget in the application.  The widget IDs, and windows are
	      shown as hex numbers.

       In addition there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree opera-
       tions.	If  the	 input focus is over an individual widget in the tree,
       then that operation will only effect that widget.  If the  input	 focus
       is  in  the Tree background it will have exactly the same effect as the
       corresponding menu item.

       The translation entries shown may be  applied  to  any  widget  in  the
       application.   If  that	widget	is a child of the Tree widget, then it
       will only affect that widget, otherwise it will have the same effect as
       the commands in the tree menu.

       Flash Active Widgets
	      This  command is the inverse of the 1mSelect Widget in Client 22mcom-
	      mand, it will show  the  user  each  widget  that	 is  currently
	      selected	in the widget tree, by flashing the corresponding wid-
	      get in the application 4mnumFlashes24m (three by	default)  times	 in
	      the 4mflashColor24m.

		   W	     Show Widget Windows      Relabel(window)
		   T	     Toggle Widget/Class Name Relabel(toggle)

	      Clicking	button	1  on  a widget adds it to the set of selected
	      widgets.	Clicking button 2 on a widget deselects all other wid-
	      gets  and then selects just that widget.	Clicking button 3 on a
	      widget toggles its label between the widget's instance name  the
	      widget's class name.


1mUSING THE RESOURCE BOX0m
       The  resource box contains five different areas.	 Each of the areas, as
       they appear on the screen, from top to bottom will be discussed.

       The Resource Line
	      This area at the top of  the  resource  box  shows  the  current
	      resource	name exactly as it would appear if you were to save it
	      to a file or apply it.

       The Widget Names and Classes
	      This area allows	you  to	 select	 exactly  which	 widgets  this
	      resource will apply to.  The area contains four lines, the first
	      contains the name of the selected widget and all its  ancestors,
	      and  the	more  restrictive  dot (1m.22m) separator.  The second line
	      contains less specific the Class names of each widget, and  well
	      as the less restrictive star (1m*22m) separator.	The third line con-
	      tains a set of special buttons called 1mAny Widget 22mwhich will gen-
	      eralize  this level to match any widget.	The last line contains
	      a set of special buttons called 1mAny Widget Chain 22mwhich will turn
	      the  single  level into something that matches zero or more lev-
	      els.

	      The initial state of this area is the  most  restrictive,	 using
	      the  resource  names  and	 the  dot separator.  By selecting the
	      other buttons in this area you  can  ease	 the  restrictions  to
	      allow  more  and	more  widgets to match the specification.  The
	      extreme case is to select all  the  1mAny	 Widget	 Chain	22mbuttons,
	      which  will  match  every	 widget	 in  the application.	As you
	      select different buttons the tree display will  update  to  show
	      you  exactly  which  widgets  will  be  effected	by the current
	      resource specification.

       Normal and Constraint Resources
	      The next area allows you to select the name  of  the  normal  or
	      constraint resources you wish to set.  Some widgets may not have
	      constraint resources, so that area will not appear.

       Resource Value
	      This next area allows you to enter  the  resource	 value.	  This
	      value  should  be	 entered exactly as you would type a line into
	      your resource file.  Thus it should contain  no  unescaped  new-
	      lines.   There  are  a  few special character sequences for this
	      file:

	      \n - This will be replaced with a newline.

	      \### - Where # is any octal digit.  This will be replaced with a
	      single  byte that contains this sequence interpreted as an octal
	      number.  For example, a value containing	a  NULL	 byte  can  be
	      stored by specifying \000.

	      \<new-line> - This will compress to nothing.

	      \\ - This will compress to a single backslash.

       Command Area
	      This  area  contains  several command buttons, described in this
	      section.

       Set Save File
	      This button allows the user to modify file  that	the  resources
	      will  be	saved to.  This button will bring up a dialog box that
	      will ask you for a filename; once the filename has been entered,
	      either  hit carriage-return or click on the 4mokay24m button.  To pop
	      down the dialog box without changing the save  file,  click  the
	      4mcancel24m button.

       Save   This button will append the 1mresource line 22mdescribed above to the
	      end of the current save file.  If no save file has been set  the
	      1mSet  Save  File	 22mdialog box will be popped up to prompt the user
	      for a filename.

       Apply  This button attempts to perform a XtSetValues call on  all  wid-
	      gets  that  match	 the 1mresource line 22mdescribed above.  The value
	      specified is applied directly to	all  matching  widgets.	  This
	      behavior	is  an	attempt to give a dynamic feel to the resource
	      editor.  Since this feature allows users to put  an  application
	      in  states it may not be willing to handle, a hook has been pro-
	      vided to allow specific applications to  block  these  SetValues
	      requests (see 1mBlocking Editres Requests 22mbelow).

	      Unfortunately  due  to design constraints imposed on the widgets
	      by the X Toolkit and the Resource Manager, trying to  coerce  an
	      inherently static system into dynamic behavior can cause strange
	      results.	There is no guarantee that the	results	 of  an	 apply
	      will be the same as what will happen when you save the value and
	      restart the application.	This functionality is provided to  try
	      to  give you a rough feel for what your changes will accomplish,
	      and the results obtained should be considered suspect  at	 best.
	      Having  said  that,  this	 is  one  of  the  neatest features of
	      editres, and I strongly suggest that you play with it,  and  see
	      what it can do.

       Save and Apply
	      This  button combines the Save and Apply actions described above
	      into one button.

       Popdown Resource Box
	      This button will remove the resource box from the display.

1mBLOCKING EDITRES REQUESTS0m
       The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget  set.	  This
       allows all applications that are linked against Xaw to be able to speak
       to the resource editor.	While this provides great flexibility, and  is
       a useful tool, it can quite easily be abused.  It is therefore possible
       for any Xaw  application	 to  specify  a	 value	for  the  1meditresBlock0m
       resource	 described  below,  to keep editres from divulging information
       about its internals, or to disable the 1mSetValues 22mpart of the  protocol.

       1meditresBlock (22mClass 1mEditresBlock)0m
	       Specifies  which	 type  of  blocking this application wishes to
	       impose on the editres protocol.

       The accepted values are:

       all	      Block all requests.

       setValues      Block all SetValues  requests.   As  this	 is  the  only
		      editres  request that actually modifies the application,
		      this is in effect stating that the application is	 read-
		      only.

       none	      Allow all editres requests.

       Remember	 that  these  resources	 are  set  on any Xaw application, 1mnot0m
       1meditres22m.  They allow individual applications to keep all or some of the
       requests	 editres  makes	 from  ever succeeding.	 Of course, editres is
       also an Xaw application, so it may  also	 be  viewed  and  modified  by
       editres	(rather	 recursive,  I know), these commands can be blocked by
       setting the 1meditresBlock 22mresource on editres itself.

1mRESOURCES0m
       For 4meditres24m the available application resources are:

       1mnumFlashes (22mClass 1mNumFlashes)0m
	       Specifies the number of times the widgets  in  the  application
	       will  be	 flashed  when	the  1mShow  Active  Widgets  22mcommand in
	       invoked.

       1mflashTime (22mClass 1mFlashTime)0m
	       Amount of time between the flashes described above.

       1mflashColor (22mClass 1mflashColor)0m
	       Specifies the color  used  to  flash  application  widgets.   A
	       bright  color  should  be  used that will immediately draw your
	       attention to the area being flashed, such as red or yellow.

       1msaveResourcesFile (22mClass 1mSaveResourcesFile)0m
	       This is the file the resource line will be append to  when  the
	       1mSave 22mbutton activated in the resource box.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In  order  to  specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
       the widgets which compose 4meditres24m.	In the notation below,	indentation
       indicates  hierarchical	structure.   The  widget  class	 name is given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1m#include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>0m
       1m#include <fontconfig/fcfreetype.h>0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mFontconfig 22mis a library designed to provide system-wide font configura-
       tion, customization and application access.


1mFUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW0m
       Fontconfig contains two essential  modules,  the	 configuration	module
       which  builds an internal configuration from XML files and the matching
       module which accepts font patterns and  returns	the  nearest  matching
       font.


   1mFONT CONFIGURATION0m
       The  configuration  module  consists of the FcConfig datatype, libexpat
       and FcConfigParse which walks over an XML tree and ammends a configura-
       tion  with data found within.  From an external perspective, configura-
       tion of the library consists of generating a valid XML tree and feeding
       that  to	 FcConfigParse.	 The only other mechanism provided to applica-
       tions for changing the running configuration is to add fonts and direc-
       tories to the list of application-provided font files.

       The intent is to make font configurations relatively static, and shared
       by as many applications as possible.  It is hoped that this  will  lead
       to  more	 stable font selection when passing names from one application
       to another.  XML was chosen as a configuration file format  because  it
       provides	 a  format  which  is  easy  for external agents to edit while
       retaining the correct structure and syntax.

       Font configuration is separate from font matching; applications needing
       to  do  their  own  matching  can  access  the available fonts from the
       library and perform private matching.  The intent is to permit applica-
       tions  to  pick	and  choose appropriate functionality from the library
       instead of forcing them to choose between this library  and  a  private
       configuration  mechanism.   The hope is that this will ensure that con-
       figuration of fonts for all applications	 can  be  centralized  in  one
       place.  Centralizing font configuration will make simplify and regular-
       ize font installation and customization.


   1mFONT PROPERTIES0m
       While font patterns may contain essentially any properties,  there  are
       some well known properties with associated types.  Fontconfig uses some
       of these properties for font matching and font completion.  Others  are
       provided as a convenience for the applications rendering mechanism.

   1mFONT MATCHING0m
       Fontconfig  performs matching by measuring the distance from a provided
       pattern to all of the available	fonts  in  the	system.	  The  closest
       matching	 font  is  selected.   This ensures that a font will always be
       returned, but doesn't ensure that it is	anything  like	the  requested
       pattern.

       Font  matching  starts  with  an	 application constructed pattern.  The
       desired attributes of the resulting font are collected together	in  an
       FcPattern object.  Each property of the pattern can contain one or more
       values; these are listed in priority order; matches earlier in the list
       are considered "closer" than matches later in the list.

       The  initial  pattern  is  modified  by	applying  the  list of editing
       instructions specific to patterns found in the configuration; each con-
       sists  of  a match predicate and a set of editing operations.  They are
       executed in the order they appeared in the configuration.   Each	 match
       causes the associated sequence of editing operations to be applied.

       After  the pattern has been edited, a sequence of default substitutions
       are performed to canonicalize the set  of  available  properties;  this
       avoids the need for the lower layers to constantly provide default val-
       ues for various font properties during rendering.

       The canonical font pattern is finally  matched  against	all  available
       fonts.	The distance from the pattern to the font is measured for each
       of several properties: foundry, charset, family, lang, spacing,	pixel-
       size,  style,  slant,  weight, antialias, rasterizer and outline.  This
       list is in priority order -- results of comparing earlier  elements  of
       this list weigh more heavily than later elements.

       There is one special case to this rule; family names are split into two
       bindings; strong and weak.   Strong  family  names  are	given  greater
       precedence  in the match than lang elements while weak family names are
       given lower precedence than lang elements.  This permits	 the  document
       language	 to  drive  font selection when any document specified font is
       unavailable.

       The pattern representing that font is augmented to include any  proper-
       ties  found  in the pattern but not found in the font itself; this per-
       mits the application to pass rendering instructions or any  other  data
       through the matching system.  Finally, the list of editing instructions
       specific to fonts found in the configuration are applied	 to  the  pat-
       tern.  This modified pattern is returned to the application.

       The  return value contains sufficient information to locate and raster-
       ize the font, including the file name, pixel size and  other  rendering
       data.   As  none	 of  the information involved pertains to the FreeType
       library, applications are free to use any rasterization engine or  even
       to take the identified font file and access it directly.

       The  match/edit	sequences  in  the  configuration are performed in two
       passes because there are essentially two different operations necessary
       -- the first is to modify how fonts are selected; aliasing families and
       adding suitable defaults.  The second is to  modify  how	 the  selected
       fonts  are  rasterized.	Those must apply to the selected font, not the
       original pattern as false matches will often occur.

   1mFONT LIST MATCHING0m
       While many applications want to locate  a  single  font	best  matching
       their  search criteria, other applications need to build a set of fonts
       which can be used to present any Unicode data.  Fontconfig provides  an
       API  to generate a list sorted by the nearness of each font to the pat-
       tern.  Every font in the system is considered, the best matching	 fonts
       are  placed first.  The application then can select whether the remain-
       ing fonts are unconditionally included in the list, or whether they are
       included	 only  if they cover portions of Unicode not covered by any of
       the preceeding fonts.

       The list resulting from this match is represented by references to  the
       original	 font  patterns	 and  so consumes very little memory.  Using a
       list entry involves creating a pattern which combines  the  information
       from  the  font with the information from the original pattern and exe-
       cuting the font substitutions.

   1mFONT NAMES0m
       Fontconfig provides a textual  representation  for  patterns  that  the
       library	can  both accept and generate.	The representation is in three
       parts, first a list of family names, second a list of point  sizes  and
       finally a list of additional properties:
	    <families>-<point sizes>:<name1>=<values1>:<name2>=<values2>...
       Values  in  a list are separated with commas.  The name needn't include
       either families or point sizes; they can be elided.  In addition, there
       are  symbolic  constants that simultaneously indicate both a name and a
       value.  Here are some examples:

		 Times-12	     12 point Times Roman
		 Times-12:bold	     12 point Times Bold
		 Courier:italic	     Courier Italic in the default size
		 Monospace:matrix=1 .1 0 1The users preferred monospace font
				     with artificial obliquing


1mLANG TAGS0m
       Each font in the database contains a list  of  languages	 it  supports.
       This is computed by comparing the Unicode coverage of the font with the
       orthography of each language.  Languages are tagged using  an  RFC-3066
       compatible  naming  and	occur  in two parts -- the ISO639 language tag
       followed a hyphen and then by the ISO 3166 country  code.   The	hyphen
       and country code may be elided.


       Fontconfig  has	orthographies  for  several  languages	built into the
       library.	 No provision has been made for adding	new  ones  aside  from
       rebuilding the library.	It currently supports 122 of the 139 languages
       named in ISO 639-1, 141 of the languages with two-letter codes from ISO
       639-2 and another 30 languages with only three-letter codes.


1mDATATYPES0m
       1mFcChar80m
       1mFcChar160m
       1mFcChar320m


	      1mFcBool 22mThese	 are  primitive	 datatypes;  the FcChar* types hold
	      precisely the number of bits  stated  (if	 supported  by	the  C
	      implementation).	 FcBool	 holds one of two CPP symbols: FcFalse
	      or FcTrue.


       1mFcMatrix0m
	      An FcMatrix holds an  affine  transformation,  usually  used  to
	      reshape  glyphs.	 A small set of matrix operations are provided
	      to manipulate these.

		   typedef struct _FcMatrix {
			double xx, xy, yx, yy;
		   } FcMatrix;


       1mFcCharSet0m
	      An FcCharSet is an abstract type that holds the set  of  encoded
	      unicode  chars in a font.	 Operations to build and compare these
	      sets are provided.


       1mFcType 22mTags the kind of data stored in an FcValue.


       1mFcValue0m
	      An FcValue object holds a single value with one of a  number  of
	      different	 types.	  The  'type'  tag  indicates  which member is
	      valid.

		   typedef struct _FcValue {
			FcType type;
			union {
			     const FcChar8 *s;
			     int i;
			     FcBool b;
			     double d;
			     const FcMatrix *m;
			     const FcCharSet *c;
			} u;
		   } FcValue;

		 type	   Union member	       Datatype
		 ------------------------------
		 FcTypeVoid	     (none)    (none)
		 FcTypeInteger	     i	       int
		 FcTypeDouble	     d	       double
		 FcTypeString	     s	       char *
		 FcTypeBool	     b	       b
		 FcTypeMatrix	     m	       FcMatrix *
		 FcTypeCharSet	     c	       FcCharSet *

       1mFcPattern0m
	      holds a set of names with	 associated  value  lists;  each  name
	      refers  to  a property of a font.	 FcPatterns are used as inputs
	      to the matching code as well as holding information  about  spe-
	      cific fonts.  Each property can hold one or more values; conven-
	      tionally all of the same type, although  the  interface  doesn't
	      demand that.


       1mFcFontSet0m

		   typedef struct _FcFontSet {
			int nfont;
			int sfont;
			FcPattern **fonts;
		   } FcFontSet;
	      An FcFontSet contains a list of FcPatterns.  Internally fontcon-
	      fig uses this data structure to hold sets of fonts.  Externally,
	      fontconfig  returns the results of listing fonts in this format.
	      'nfont' holds the number	of  patterns  in  the  'fonts'	array;
	      'sfont' is used to indicate the size of that array.


       1mFcStrSet0m
	      1mFcStrList  22mFcStrSet holds a list of strings that can be appended
	      to and enumerated.  Its unique characteristic is that  the  enu-
	      meration	works  even while strings are appended during enumera-
	      tion.  FcStrList is used during enumeration to safely  and  cor-
	      rectly  walk  the list of strings even while that list is edited
	      in the middle of enumeration.


       1mFcObjectSet0m

		   typedef struct _FcObjectSet {
			int nobject;
			int sobject;
			const char **objects;
		   } FcObjectSet;

	      holds a set of names and is used to specify  which  fields  from
	      fonts are placed in the the list of returned patterns when list-
	      ing fonts.


       1mFcObjectType0m

		   typedef  struct  _FcObjectType   {		  const	  char
	      *object;		 FcType type;	   } FcObjectType;
	      marks  the type of a pattern element generated when parsing font
	      names.  Applications can add new object types so that font names
	      may contain the new elements.


       1mFcConstant0m

		   typedef  struct _FcConstant {	  const FcChar8 *name;
			const  char  *object;		 int   value;	     }
	      FcConstant;
	      Provides	for symbolic constants for new pattern elements.  When
	      'name' is seen in a font name, an 'object'  element  is  created
	      with value 'value'.


       1mFcBlanks0m
	      holds  a	list  of Unicode chars which are expected to be blank;
	      unexpectedly blank chars are  assumed  to	 be  invalid  and  are
	      elided from the charset associated with the font.


       1mFcFileCache0m
	      holds  the  per-user cache information for use while loading the
	      font database. This is built automatically for the current  con-
	      figuration  when	that is loaded.	 Applications must always pass
	      '0' when one is requested.


       1mFcConfig0m
	      holds a complete configuration of	 the  library;	there  is  one
	      default  configuration,  other  can be constructed from XML data
	      structures.  All public entry points that need global  data  can
	      take  an optional FcConfig* argument; passing 0 uses the default
	      configuration.  FcConfig objects hold two	 sets  of  fonts,  the
	      first  contains those specified by the configuration, the second
	      set holds those added by the application	at  run-time.	Inter-
	      faces  that  need	 to  reference a particulat set use one of the
	      FcSetName enumerated values.


       1mFcSetName0m
	      Specifies one of the two sets of fonts available in a configura-
	      tion; FcSetSystem for those fonts specified in the configuration
	      and FcSetApplication which holds fonts provided by the  applica-
	      tion.


       1mFcResult0m
	      Used  as	a  return  type	 for  functions manipulating FcPattern
	      objects.

		 Result code	     Meaning
		 ------------------------------
		 FcResultMatch	     Object exists with the specified ID
		 FcResultNoMatch     Object doesn't exist at all
		 FcResultTypeMismatch	       Object  exists,	but  the  type
       doesn't match
		 FcResultNoId	     Object  exists, but has fewer values than
       specified


       1mFcAtomic0m
	      Used for locking access to config files.	Provides a safe way to
	      update configuration files.


1mFUNCTIONS0m
   1mFcMatrix0m
       FcMatrix structures hold an affine transformation in matrix form.


       Initializes a matrix to the identify transformation.


       FcMatrix *FcMatrixCopy (const FcMatrix *mat)
	      Allocates a new FcMatrix and copies 'mat' into it.


       FcBool FcMatrixEqual (const FcMatrix *mat1, const FcMatrix *mat2)
	      Returns FcTrue if 'mat1' and 'mat2' are equal, else FcFalse.


       void FcMatrixMultiply (FcMatrix *result, const FcMatrix *a, const FcMa-
       trix *b)
	      Multiplies 'a' and 'b' together, placing the result in 'result'.
	      'result' may refer to the sam matrix as either 'a' or 'b'.


       void FcMatrixRotate (FcMatrix *m, double c, double s)
	      If 'c' is	 cos(angle)  and  's'  is  sin(angle),	FcMatrixRotate
	      rotates the matrix by 'angle'.


       void FcMatrixScale (FcMatrix *m, double sx, double sy)
	      Scales  'm'  by 'sx' in the horizontal dimension and 'sy' in the
	      vertical dimension.


       void FcMatrixShear (FcMatrix *m, double sh, double sv)
	      Shears 'm' by 'sh' in the horizontal direction and 'sv'  in  the
	      vertical direction.


   1mFcCharSet0m
       An  FcCharSet  is  a  boolean  array indicating a set of unicode chars.
       Those associated with a font are marked constant and cannot be  edited.
       FcCharSets  may	be  reference counted internally to reduce memory con-
       sumption; this may be visible to applications as the result  of	FcCha-
       rSetCopy	 may return it's argument, and that CharSet may remain unmodi-
       fiable.


       FcCharSet *FcCharSetCreate (void)
	      Creates an empty FcCharSet object.


       void FcCharSetDestroy (FcCharSet *fcs)
	      Frees an FcCharSet object.


       FcBool FcCharSetAddChar (FcCharSet *fcs, FcChar32 ucs4)
	      Adds a single unicode char to  the  set,	returning  FcFalse  on
	      failure,	either	as  a result of a constant set or from running
	      out of memory.


       FcCharSet *FcCharSetCopy (FcCharSet *src)
	      Makes a copy of 'src'; note that this may not actually  do  any-
	      thing more than increment the reference count on 'src'.


       FcBool FcCharSetEqual (const FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet *b)
	      Returns  whether	'a'  and  'b'  contain the same set of unicode
	      chars.


       FcCharSet *FcCharSetIntersect (const FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet *b)
	      Returns a set including only those chars found in both  'a'  and
	      'b'.


       FcCharSet *FcCharSetUnion (const FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet *b);
	      Returns  a set including only those chars found in either 'a' or
	      'b'.


       FcCharSet *FcCharSetSubtract (const FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet *b)
	      Returns a set including only those chars found in	 'a'  but  not
	      'b'.


       FcBool FcCharSetHasChar (const FcCharSet *fcs, FcChar32 ucs4)
	      Returns whether 'fcs' contains the char 'ucs4'.


       FcChar32 FcCharSetCount (const FcCharSet *a)

       FcChar32	 FcCharSetSubtractCount	 (const	 FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet
       *b)
	      Returns the number of chars that are in 'a' but not in 'b'.


       FcBool FcCharSetIsSubset (const FcCharSet *a, const FcCharSet *b)
	      Returns whether 'a' is a subset of 'b'.


       FcChar32	   FcCharSetFirstPage	 (const	   FcCharSet	*a,   FcChar32
       [FC_CHARSET_MAP_SIZE], FcChar32 *next)
	      Builds an array of bits marking the first page of Unicode cover-
	      age of 'a'.  Returns the base of the array.  'next' contains the
	      next page in the font.


       FcChar32	   FcCharSetNextPage	(const	  FcCharSet    *a,    FcChar32
       [FC_CHARSET_MAP_SIZE], FcChar32 *next)
	      Builds  an array of bits marking the Unicode coverage of 'a' for
	      page '*next'.  Returns the base of the array.   'next'  contains
	      the next page in the font.


   1mFcValue0m
       FcValue	is a structure containing a type tag and a union of all possi-
       ble datatypes.  The tag is an enum of type 1mFcType 22mand  is  intended	 to
       provide	a  measure  of run-time typechecking, although that depends on
       careful programming.


       void FcValueDestroy (FcValue v)
	      Frees any memory referenced by  `v'.   Values  of	 type  FcType-
	      String,  FcTypeMatrix  and  FcTypeCharSet	 reference memory, the
	      other types do not.


       FcValue FcValueSave (FcValue v)
	      Returns a copy of `v' duplicating any object referenced by it so
	      that  `v' may be safely destroyed without harming the new value.


   1mFcPattern0m
       An FcPattern is an opaque  type	that  holds  both  patterns  to	 match
       against	the  available	fonts,	as  well as the information about each
       font.


       FcPattern *FcPatternCreate (void)
	      Creates a pattern with no properties;  used  to  build  patterns
	      from scratch.


       void FcPatternDestroy (FcPattern *p)
	      Destroys	a  pattern, in the process destroying all related val-
	      ues.


       FcBool FcPatternEqual (const FcPattern *pa, const FcPattern *pb);
	      Returns whether 'pa' and 'pb' are exactly alike.


       FcBool FcPatternEqualSubset (const FcPattern *pa, const FcPattern  *pb,
       const FcObjectSet *os)
	      Returns whether 'pa' and 'pb' have exactly the same  values  for
	      all of the objects in 'os'.


       FcChar32 FcPatternHash (const FcPattern *p)
	      Returns  a  32-bit number which is the same for any two patterns
	      which are exactly alike.


       FcBool FcPatternAdd (FcPattern *p, const char *object,  FcValue	value,
       FcBool append)
	      Adds a single value to the list of values	 associated  with  the
	      property	named  `object'.   If `append' is FcTrue, the value is
	      added at the end of any existing list, otherwise it is  inserted
	      at  the  begining.   `value'  is	saved  (with FcValueSave) when
	      inserted into the pattern so that the library retains no	refer-
	      ence to any application-supplied data structure.


       FcBool  FcPatternAddWeak	 (FcPattern  *p,  const	 char *object, FcValue
       value, FcBool append)
	      FcPatternAddWeak	is essentially the same as FcPatternAdd except
	      that any values added to the list have binding 'weak' instead of

       FcCharSet *c)
       FcBool FcPatternAddBool (FcPattern *p, const char *object, FcBool b)
	      These  are  all convenience functions that insert objects of the
	      specified type into the pattern.	Use  these  in	preference  to
	      FcPatternAdd  as	they  will  provide compile-time typechecking.
	      These all append values to any existing list of values.


       FcResult FcPatternGet  (FcPattern  *p,  const  char  *object,  int  id,
       FcValue *v)
	      Returns in `v' the `id'th value  associated  with	 the  property
	      `object'.	  The  value returned is not a copy, but rather refers
	      to the data stored within the  pattern  directly.	  Applications
	      must not free this value.


       FcResult	 FcPatternGetInteger (FcPattern *p, const char *object, int n,
       int *i);
       FcResult	 FcPatternGetDouble  (FcPattern *p, const char *object, int n,
       double *d);

       FcCharSet **c);
       FcResult	 FcPatternGetBool  (FcPattern  *p,  const char *object, int n,
       FcBool *b);
	      These  are convenience functions that call FcPatternGet and ver-
	      ify that the returned data is of the expected type. They	return
	      FcResultTypeMismatch  if	this is not the case.  Note that these
	      (like FcPatternGet) do not make a copy  of  any  data  structure
	      referenced  by  the  return  value.   Use these in preference to
	      FcPatternGet to provide compile-time typechecking.


       FcPattern *FcPatternBuild (FcPattern *orig, ...);
       FcPattern *FcPatternVaBuild (FcPattern *orig, va_list va)
	      Builds a pattern using a list  of	 objects,  types  and  values.
	      Each  value to be entered in the pattern is specified with three
	      arguments:

	      1. Object name, a string describing the property to be added.

	      2. Object type, one of the FcType enumerated values

	      3. Value, not an FcValue, but the raw type as passed to  any  of
	      the  FcPatternAdd<type>  functions.   Must match the type of the
	      second argument.

	      The argument list is terminated by a null object name, no object
	      type nor value need be passed for this.  The values are added to
	      `pattern', if `pattern' is null, a new pattern is	 created.   In
	      either case, the pattern is returned. Example:

		     pattern  =	 FcPatternBuild	 (0,  FC_FAMILY, FtTypeString,
		     "Times", (char *) 0);

	      FcPatternVaBuild is used when the arguments are already  in  the
	      form of a varargs value.


       FcBool FcPatternDel (FcPattern *p, const char *object)
	      Deletes  all  values  associated	with  the  property  `object',
	      returning whether the property existed or not.


       void FcPatternPrint (const FcPattern *p)
	      Prints an easily readable version	 of  the  pattern  to  stdout.
	      There  is	 no  provision for reparsing data in this format, it's
	      just for diagnostics and debugging.


       void FcDefaultSubstitute (FcPattern *pattern)
	      Supplies default values for underspecified font patterns:

	      ·	     Patterns without a specified style or weight are  set  to
		     Medium

	      ·	     Patterns  without	a  specified style or slant are set to
		     Roman

	      ·	     Patterns without a specified pixel	 size  are  given  one
		     computed  from any specified point size (default 12), dpi
		     (default 75) and scale (default 1).


       FcPattern *FcNameParse (const char *name)
	      Converts 'name' from the standard text  format  described	 above
	      into a pattern.


       FcChar8 *FcNameUnparse (FcPattern *pat)
	      Converts	the  given  pattern  into  the	standard  text	format
	      described above.	The return value is not	 static,  but  instead
	      refers  to  newly	 allocated memory which should be freed by the
	      caller.


   1mFcFontSet0m
       An FcFontSet simply holds a list of patterns; these are used to	return
       the results of listing available fonts.

	      Creates an empty font set.


       void FcFontSetDestroy (FcFontSet *s);
	      Destroys	a  font	 set.	Note that this destroys any referenced
	      patterns as well.


       FcBool FcFontSetAdd (FcFontSet *s, FcPattern *font)
	      Adds a pattern to a font set.  Note  that	 the  pattern  is  not
	      copied before being inserted into the set.


   1mFcObjectSet0m
       An  FcObjectSet	holds  a list of pattern property names; it is used to
       indiciate which properties are to be  returned  in  the	patterns  from

	      Adds a proprety name to the set.


       void FcObjectSetDestroy (FcObjectSet *os)
	      Destroys an object set.



       FcObjectSet *FcObjectSetBuild (const char *first, ...)
       FcObjectSet *FcObjectSetVaBuild (const char *first, va_list va)
	      These  build  an object set from a null-terminated list of prop-
	      erty names.


   1mFcObjectType0m
       Provides for applcation-specified font name object types	 so  that  new
       pattern elements can be generated from font names.


       FcBool FcNameRegisterObjectTypes (const FcObjectType *types, int ntype)
	      Register 'ntype' new object types.


       FcBool  FcNameUnregisterObjectTypes  (const  FcObjectType  *types,  int
       ntype)
	      Unregister 'ntype' object types.


       const FcObjectType *FcNameGetObjectType (const char *object)

       FcBool FcNameConstant (FcChar8 *string, int *result);
	      Returns whether a symbolic constant with name 'string' is regis-
	      tered, placing the value of the constant in 'result' if present.


   1mFcBlanks0m
       An FcBlanks object holds a list of Unicode chars which are expected  to
       be  blank  when	drawn.	 When scanning new fonts, any glyphs which are
       empty and not in this list will be assumed to be broken and not	placed
       in  the	FcCharSet  associated with the font.  This provides a signifi-
       cantly more accurate CharSet for applications.


       FcBlanks *FcBlanksCreate (void)
	      Creates an empty FcBlanks object.


       void FcBlanksDestroy (FcBlanks *b)
	      Destroys an FcBlanks object, freeing any associated memory.


       FcBool FcBlanksAdd (FcBlanks *b, FcChar32 ucs4)

	      if this process ran out of memory.


       FcBool FcBlanksIsMember (FcBlanks *b, FcChar32 ucs4)
	      Returns whether the specified FcBlanks object contains the indi-
	      cated Unicode value.


   1mFcConfig0m
       An FcConfig object holds the internal representation  of	 a  configura-
       tion.   There  is a default configuration which applications may use by
       passing 0 to any function using the data within an FcConfig.


       FcConfig *FcConfigCreate (void)
	      Creates an empty configuration.


       void FcConfigDestroy (FcConfig *config)
	      Destroys a configuration and any data associated with it.	  Note
	      that  calling this function with the return from FcConfigGetCur-
	      rent will place the library in an indeterminate state.


       FcBool FcConfigSetCurrent (FcConfig *config)
	      Sets the current default configuration to 'config'.   Implicitly
	      calls FcConfigBuildFonts if necessary, returning FcFalse if that
	      call fails.


       FcConfig *FcConfigGetCurrent (void)
	      Returns the current default configuration.


       FcBool FcConfigUptoDate (FcConfig *config)
	      Checks all of the files related to 'config' and returns  whether
	      the in-memory version is in sync with the disk version.


       FcBool FcConfigBuildFonts (FcConfig *config)
	      Builds  the  set of available fonts for the given configuration.
	      Note that any changes to the configuration after this call  have
	      indeterminate  effects.	Returns FcFalse if this operation runs
	      out of memory.


       FcStrList *FcConfigGetConfigDirs (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns the list of font directories specified in the configura-
	      tion files for 'config'.	Does not include any subdirectories.


       FcStrList *FcConfigGetFontDirs (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns  the list of font directories in 'config'. This includes
	      the configured font directories along with any directories below
	      those in the filesystem.


       FcStrList *FcConfigGetConfigFiles (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns  the  list of known configuration files used to generate
	      'config'.	 Note that this will  not  include  any	 configuration
	      done with FcConfigParse.


       char *FcConfigGetCache (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns  the name of the file used to store per-user font infor-
	      mation.


       FcFontSet *FcConfigGetFonts (FcConfig *config, FcSetName set)
	      Returns one of the two sets of fonts from the  configuration  as
	      specified by 'set'.


       FcBlanks *FcConfigGetBlanks (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns the FcBlanks object associated with the given configura-
	      tion, if no blanks were present in the configuration, this func-
	      tion will return 0.


       int FcConfigGetRescanInverval (FcConfig *config)
	      Returns  the interval between automatic checks of the configura-
	      tion (in seconds) specified in 'config'.	The  configuration  is
	      checked  during  a  call	to  FcFontList	when this interval has
	      passed since the last check.


       FcBool FcConfigSetRescanInverval (FcConfig *config, int rescanInterval)
	      Sets the rescan interval; returns FcFalse if an error  occurred.


       FcBool FcConfigAppFontAddFile (FcConfig *config, const char *file)
	      Adds an application-specific font to the configuration.


       FcBool FcConfigAppFontAddDir (FcConfig *config, const char *dir)
	      Scans  the  specified directory for fonts, adding each one found
	      to the application-specific set of fonts.


       void FcConfigAppFontClear (FcConfig *config)
	      Clears the set of application-specific fonts.


       FcBool  FcConfigSubstituteWithPat  (FcConfig  *config,  FcPattern   *p,
       FcPattern *p_pat FcMatchKind kind)
	      Performs the sequence of	pattern	 modification  operations,  if
	      'kind'  is  FcMatchPattern,  then those tagged as pattern opera-
	      tions are applied, else if 'kind' is FcMatchFont,	 those	tagged
	      as font operations are applied and p_pat is used for <test> ele-
	      ments with target=pattern.


       FcBool FcConfigSubstitute (FcConfig *config, FcPattern *p,  FcMatchKind
       kind)
	      Calls FcConfigSubstituteWithPat setting p_pat to NULL.


       FcPattern  *FcFontMatch	(FcConfig  *config,  FcPattern	*p,   FcResult
       *result)
	      Returns the font in 'config'  most  close	 matching  'p'.	  This
	      function	should	be  called  only  after FcConfigSubstitute and
	      FcDefaultSubstitute have been  called  for  'p';	otherwise  the
	      results will not be correct.


       FcFontSet  *FcFontSort  (FcConfig  *config,  FcPattern *p, FcBool trim,
       FcCharSet **csp, FcResult *result) Returns the list of fonts sorted by
	      closeness	 to  'p'.   If	'trim' is FcTrue, elements in the list
	      which don't include Unicode coverage  not	 provided  by  earlier
	      elements	in the list are elided.	 The union of Unicode coverage
	      of all of the fonts is returned in 'csp', if 'csp' is not	 NULL.
	      This function should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and
	      FcDefaultSubstitute have been  called  for  'p';	otherwise  the
	      results will not be correct.

       The  returned  FcFontSet	 references  FcPattern structures which may be
       shared by the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications
       must  not modify these patterns.	 Instead, they should be passed, along
       with 'p' to FcFontRenderPrepare which combines  them  into  a  complete
       pattern.

       The  FcFontSet returned by FcFontSort is destroyed by caling FcFontSet-
       Destroy.


       FcPattern  *FcFontRenderPrepare	(FcConfig  *config,  FcPattern	 *pat,
       FcPattern *font)
	      Creates a new pattern  consisting	 of  elements  of  'font'  not
	      appearing	 in  'pat',  elements of 'pat' not appearing in 'font'
	      and the best matching value from 'pat' for elements appearing in
	      both.   The  result  is passed to FcConfigSubstitute with 'kind'
	      FcMatchFont and then returned.


       FcFontSet *FcFontList (FcConfig *config, FcPattern *p, FcObjectSet *os)
	      Selects fonts matching 'p', creates patterns  from  those	 fonts
	      containing  only	the  objects  in  'os'	and returns the set of
	      unique such patterns.


       char *FcConfigFilename (const char *name)
	      Given the specified external entity name, return the  associated
	      filename.	  This	provides applications a way to convert various
	      configuration file references into filename form.

       A null or empty 'name' indicates that the  default  configuration  file
       should  be  used; which file this references can be overridden with the
       FC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.  Next, if  the  name  starts  with
       '~',  it	 refers to a file in the current users home directory.	Other-
       wise if the name doesn't start with '/', it refers to  a	 file  in  the
       default	configuration directory; the built-in default directory can be
       overridden with the FC_CONFIG_DIR environment variable.


   1mInitialization0m
       These functions provide some control over how the library  is  initial-
       ized.


       FcConfig *FcInitLoadConfig (void)
	      Loads  the  default configuration file and returns the resulting
	      configuration.  Does not load any font information.


       FcConfig *FcInitLoadConfigAndFonts (void)
	      Loads the default	 configuration	file  and  builds  information
	      about the available fonts.  Returns the resulting configuration.


       FcBool FcInit (void)
	      Loads the default configuration file and	the  fonts  referenced
	      therein  and  sets  the  default	configuration  to that result.
	      Returns whether this process succeeded or not.  If  the  default
	      configuration has already been loaded, this routine does nothing
	      and returns FcTrue.


       int FcGetVersion (void)
	      Returns the version number of the library.


       FcBool FcInitReinitialize (void)
	      Forces the default configuration file to be reloaded and	resets
	      the default configuration.


       FcBool FcInitBringUptoDate (void)
	      Checks  the rescan interval in the default configuration, check-
	      ing the configuration if the interval has passed	and  reloading
	      the configuration if when any changes are detected.


   1mFcAtomic0m
       These  functions	 provide  a  safe way to update config files, allowing
       ongoing reading of the old config file while  locked  for  writing  and
       ensuring	 that  a consistent and complete version of the config file is
       always available.


       FcAtomic * FcAtomicCreate (const FcChar8	  *file)
	      Creates a data  structure	 containing  data  needed  to  control
	      access  to  'file'.   Writing  is done to a separate file.  Once
	      that file is complete, the original configuration file is atomi-
	      cally  replaced  so that reading process always see a consistent
	      and complete file without the need to lock for reading.


       FcBool FcAtomicLock (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Attempts to lock	the  file  referenced  by  'atomic'.   Returns
	      FcFalse  if  the file is locked by another process, else returns
	      FcTrue and leaves the file locked.


       FcChar8 *FcAtomicNewFile (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Returns the filename for writing a new version of the file  ref-
	      erenced by 'atomic'.


       FcChar8 *FcAtomicOrigFile (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Returns the file refernced by 'atomic'.


       FcBool FcAtomicReplaceOrig (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Replaces	the  original file referenced by 'atomic' with the new
	      file.


       void FcAtomicDeleteNew (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Deletes the new file.


       void FcAtomicUnlock (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Unlocks the file.


       void FcAtomicDestroy (FcAtomic *atomic)
	      Destroys 'atomic'.


   1mFreeType specific functions0m
       1m#include <fontconfig/fcfreetype.h>0m
       While the fontconfig library doesn't insist that FreeType  be  used  as
       the rasterization mechanism for fonts, it does provide some convenience
       functions.


       FT_UInt FcFreeTypeCharIndex (FT_Face face, FcChar32 ucs4)
	      Maps a Unicode char to a glyph index.  This function uses infor-
	      mation  from several possible underlying encoding tables to work
	      around broken fonts.  As a result, this function isn't  designed
	      to  be  used  in	performance sensitive areas; results from this
	      function are intended to be cached by higher level functions.


       FcCharSet *FcFreeTypeCharSet (FT_Face face, FcBlanks *blanks) Scans a
	      FreeType face and returns the  set  of  encoded  Unicode	chars.
	      This  scans  several encoding tables to build as complete a list
	      as possible.  If 'blanks' is not 0, the glyphs in the  font  are
	      examined	and any blank glyphs not in 'blanks' are not placed in
	      the returned FcCharSet.


       FcPattern *FcFreeTypeQuery (const char *file, int id, FcBlanks *blanks,
       int *count)
	      Constructs a pattern representing the  'id'th  font  in  'file'.
	      The number of fonts in 'file' is returned in 'count'.


   1mXML specific functions0m
       FcBool  FcConfigParseAndLoad  (FcConfig	*config,  const FcChar8 *file,
       FcBool complain)
	      Walks  the  configuration	 in 'file' and constructs the internal
	      representation in 'config'.  Any include files  referenced  from
	      within  'file' will be loaded with FcConfigLoad and also parsed.
	      If 'complain' is FcFalse, no warning will be displayed if 'file'
	      does not exist.


   1mFile and Directory routines0m
       FcBool  FcFileScan (FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache,
       FcBlanks *blanks, const char *file, FcBool force)
	      Scans  a	single	file  and  adds	 all fonts found to 'set'.  If
	      'force' is FcTrue, then the file is scanned even	if  associated
	      information  is  found in 'cache'.  If 'file' is a directory, it
	      is added to 'dirs'.


       FcBool FcDirScan (FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs,  FcFileCache  *cache,
       FcBlanks *blanks, const char *dir, FcBool force)
	      Scans an entire directory and adds all fonts found to 'set'.  If
	      'force'  is  FcTrue,  then the directory and all files within it
	      are scanned even if information is present in the	 per-directory
	      cache  file  or  'cache'.	 Any subdirectories found are added to
	      'dirs'.


       FcBool FcDirSave (FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, const char *dir)
	      Creates the per-directory cache file for 'dir' and populates  it
	      with the fonts in 'set' and subdirectories in 'dirs'.


       FcBool FcDirCacheValid (const FcChar8 *cache_file)
	      Returns  FcTrue  if  'cache_file' is no older than the directory
	      containing it, else FcFalse.


   1mFcStrSet and FcStrList0m
       A data structure for enumerating	 strings,  used	 to  list  directories
       while  scanning	the configuration as directories are added while scan-
       ning.


       FcStrSet *FcStrSetCreate (void)
	      Create an empty set.


       FcBool FcStrSetMember (FcStrSet *set, const FcChar8 *s)
	      Returns whether 's' is a member of 'set'.


       FcBool FcStrSetAdd (FcStrSet *set, const FcChar8 *s)
	      Adds a copy of 's' to 'set'.


       FcBool FcStrSetAddFilename (FcStrSet *set, const FcChar8 *s)
	      Adds a copy 's' to 'set', The copy is  created  with  FcStrCopy-
	      Filename	so that leading '~' values are replaced with the value
	      of the HOME environment variable.


       FcBool FcStrSetDel (FcStrSet *set, const FcChar8 *s)
	      Removes 's' from 'set', returning FcTrue if  's'	was  a	member
	      else FcFalse.


       void FcStrSetDestroy (FcStrSet *set)
	      Destroys 'set'.


       FcStrList *FcStrListCreate (FcStrSet *set)
	      Creates an enumerator to list the strings in 'set'.


       FcChar8 *FcStrListNext (FcStrList *list)
	      Returns the next string in 'set'.


       void FcStrListDone (FcStrList *list)
	      Destroys the enumerator 'list'.


   1mString utilities0m
       int FcUtf8ToUcs4 (FcChar8 *src, FcChar32 *dst, int len)
	      Converts the next Unicode char from 'src' into 'dst' and returns
	      the number of bytes containing the char.	'src' nust be at least
	      'len' bytes long.


       int FcUcs4ToUtf8 (FcChar32 src, FcChar8 dst[FC_UTF8_MAX_LEN])
	      Converts	the Unicode char from 'src' into 'dst' and returns the
	      number of bytes needed to encode the char.


       FcBool FcUtf8Len (FcChar8 *src, int len, int *nchar, int *wchar)
	      Counts the number of Unicode chars  in  'len'  bytes  of	'src'.
	      Places  that  count  in  'nchar'.	  'wchar'  contains  1, 2 or 4
	      depending on the number of bytes needed to hold the largest uni-
	      code  char counted.  The return value indicates whether 'src' is
	      a well-formed UTF8 string.


       int FcUtf16ToUcs4 (FcChar8 *src, FcEndian endian,  FcChar32  *dst,  int
       len)
	      Converts the next Unicode char from 'src' into 'dst' and returns
	      the  number of bytes containing the char. 'src' must be at least
	      'len' bytes long.	 Bytes of 'src' are combined into 16-bit units
	      according to 'endian'.


       FcBool  FcUtf16Len (FcChar8 *src, FcEndian endian, int len, int *nchar,
       int *wchar)
	      Counts  the  number  of  Unicode	chars in 'len' bytes of 'src'.
	      Bytes of 'src' are  combined  into  16-bit  units	 according  to
	      'endian'.	  Places that count in 'nchar'.	 'wchar' contains 1, 2
	      or 4 depending on the number of bytes needed to hold the largest
	      unicode  char  counted.	The  return  value  indicates  whether
	      'string' is a well-formed UTF16 string.


       FcChar8 *FcStrCopy (const FcChar8 *s)
	      Allocates memory, copies 's' and returns the  resulting  buffer.
	      Yes,  this  is  'strdup',	 but  that function isn't available on
	      every platform.


       FcChar8 *FcStrCopyFilename (const FcChar8 *s)
	      Just like FcStrCopy except that  it  converts  any  leading  '~'
	      characters in 's' to the value of the HOME environment variable.


       int FcStrCmpIgnoreCase (const char *s1, const char *s2)
	      Returns the usual <0, 0, >0 result of comparing 's1'  and	 's2'.
	      This  test is case-insensitive in the ASCII range and will oper-
	      ate properly with UTF8 encoded strings,  although	 it  does  not
	      check for well formed strings.


       FcChar8 *FcStrDirname (const FcChar8 *file)
	      Returns the directory containing 'file'.


       FcChar8 *FcStrBasename (const FcChar8 *file)
	      Returns the filename of 'file' stripped of any leading directory
	      names.


1mCONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT0m
       Configuration files for fontconfig are stored in XML format; this  for-
       mat makes external configuration tools easier to write and ensures that
       they will generate syntactically correct configuration files.   As  XML
       files  are  plain text, they can also be manipulated by the expert user
       using a text editor.

       The fontconfig document type definition resides in the external	entity
       "fonts.dtd";  this is normally stored in the default font configuration
       directory (/etc/fonts).	Each configuration  file  should  contain  the
       following structure:

	    <?xml version="1.0"?>
	    <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
	    <fontconfig>
	    ...
	    </fontconfig>


   1m<fontconfig>0m
       This  is the top level element for a font configuration and can contain
       <dir>, <cache>, <include>, <match> and <alias> elements in any order.


   1m<dir>0m
       This element contains a directory name which will be scanned  for  font
       files to include in the set of available fonts.


   1m<cache>0m
       This element contains a file name for the per-user cache of font infor-
       mation.	If it starts with '~', it refers to a file in the  users  home
       directory.   This  file	is  used  to hold information about fonts that
       isn't present in the per-directory cache files.	 It  is	 automatically
       maintained  by  the  fontconfig	library.  The default for this file is
       ``~/.fonts.cache-<version>'', where <version> is the font configuration
       file version number (currently 1).


   1m<include ignore_missing="no">0m
       This  element  contains	the  name of an additional configuration file.
       When the XML datatype is traversed by FcConfigParse,  the  contents  of
       the  file  will	also be incorporated into the configuration by passing
       the filename to FcConfigLoadAndParse.  If 'ignore_missing'  is  set  to
       "yes"  instead of the default "no", a missing file will elicit no warn-
       ing message from the library.


   1m<config>0m
       This element provides a place to consolodate  additional	 configuration
       information.  <config> can contain <blank> and <rescan> elements in any
       order.


   1m<blank>0m
       Fonts often include "broken" glyphs which appear in  the	 encoding  but
       are  drawn  as blanks on the screen.  Within the <blank> element, place
       each Unicode characters which is supposed to be blank in an <int>  ele-
       ment.   Characters outside of this set which are drawn as blank will be
       elided from the set of characters supported by the font.	 <b


   1m<rescan>0m
       The <rescan> element holds an <int> element which indicates the default
       interval	 between  automatic  checks  for  font	configuration changes.
       Fontconfig will validate all of the configuration files and directories
       and  automatically rebuild the internal datastructures when this inter-
       val passes.


   1m<match target="pattern">0m
       This element holds first a (possibly empty) list of <test> elements and
       then  a (possibly empty) list of <edit> elements.  Patterns which match
       all of the tests are subjected to all the edits.	 If 'target' is set to
       "font"  instead	of the default "pattern", then this element applies to
       the font name resulting from a match rather than a font pattern	to  be
       matched.


   1m<test qual="any" name="property" compare="eq">0m
       This element contains a single value which is compared with the pattern
       property "property" (substitute any of the property names seen  above).
       'compare'  can  be one of "eq", "not_eq", "less", "less_eq", "more", or
       "more_eq".  'qual' may either be the default, "any", in which case  the
       match  succeeds	if  any value associated with the property matches the
       test value, or "all", in which case all of the values  associated  with
       the property must match the test value.


   1m<edit name="property" mode="assign" binding="weak">0m
       This  element  contains a list of expression elements (any of the value
       or operator elements).  The expression elements are evaluated  at  run-
       time  and  modify the property "property".  The modification depends on
       whether "property" was matched by one of	 the  associated  <test>  ele-
       ments, if so, the modification may affect the first matched value.  Any
       values inserted into the property  are  given  the  indicated  binding.
       'mode' is one of:
	      Mode	Operation with match			Operation without match
	      --------------------------------------------------
	      "assign"	Replace matching value			Replace all values
	      "assign_replace"		    Replace all values	Replace all values
	      "prepend" Insert before matching value		Insert at head of list
	      "prepend_first"		    Insert at head of listInsert at head of list
	      "append"	Append after matching value		Append at end of list
	      "append_last"		    Append at end of listAppend at end of list

   1m<int>0m
   1m<double>0m
   1m<string>0m
   1m<bool>0m
       These  elements hold a single value of the indicated type.  <bool> ele-
       ments hold either true or false.

   1m<matrix>0m
       This element holds the four <double> elements of an affine  transforma-
       tion.

   1m<name>0m
       Holds  a property name.	Evaluates to the first value from the property
       of the font, not the pattern.

   1m<const>0m
       Holds the name of a constant; these are always integers	and  serve  as
       symbolic names for common font values:

	      Constant	Property  CPP symbol
	      ------------------------------
	      light	weight	  FC_WEIGHT_LIGHT
	      medium	weight	  FC_WEIGHT_MEDIUM
	      demibold	weight	  FC_WEIGHT_DEMIBOLD
	      bold	weight	  FC_WEIGHT_BOLD
	      black	weight	  FC_WEIGHT_BLACK
	      roman	slant	  FC_SLANT_ROMAN
	      italic	slant	  FC_SLANT_ITALIC
	      oblique	slant	  FC_SLANT_OBLIQUE
	      proportional	  spacing   FC_PROPORTIONAL
	      mono	spacing	  FC_MONO
	      charcell	spacing	  FC_CHARCELL
	      unknown	rgba	  FC_RGBA_UNKNOWN
	      rgb	rgba	  FC_RGBA_RGB
	      bgr	rgba	  FC_RGBA_BGR
	      vrgb	rgba	  FC_RGBA_VRGB
	      vbgr	rgba	  FC_RGBA_VBGR
	      none	rgba	  FC_RGBA_NONE

   1m<or>0m
   1m<and>0m
   1m<plus>0m
   1m<minus>0m
   1m<times>0m
   1m<divide>0m
       These  elements perform the specified operation on a list of expression
       elements.  <or> and <and> are boolean, not bitwise.

   1m<eq>0m
   1m<not_eq>0m
   1m<less>0m
   1m<less_eq>0m
   1m<more>0m
   1m<more_eq>0m
       These elements compare two values, producing a boolean result.

   1m<not>0m
       Inverts the boolean sense of its one expression element

   1m<if>0m
       This element takes three expression elements; if the value of the first
       is true, it produces the value of the second, otherwise it produces the
       value of the third.

   1m<alias>0m
       Alias elements provide a shorthand notation for the set of common match
       operations needed to substitute one font family for another.  They con-
       tain a <family> element followed by  optional  <prefer>,	 <accept>  and
       <default>  elements.  Fonts matching the <family> element are edited to
       prepend the list of <prefer>ed families before the  matching  <family>,
       append  the <accept>able familys after the matching <family> and append
       the <default> families to the end of the family list.

   1m<family>0m
       Holds a single font family name

   1m<prefer>0m
   1m<accept>0m
   1m<default>0m
       These hold a list of <family> elements to be used by the	 <alias>  ele-
       ment.

1mNAME0m
       fslsfonts - list fonts served by X font server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mfslsfonts 22m[-options ...] [-fn pattern]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mFslsfonts24m  lists  the fonts that match the given 4mpattern24m.  The wildcard
       character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters  (includ-
       ing  none),  and	 "?"  to match any single character.  If no pattern is
       given, "*" is assumed.

       The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent  them  from	 being
       expanded by the shell.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-server 4m22mhost24m1m:4m22mport0m
	       This option specifies the X font server to contact.


       1m-l	 22mLists  some	 attributes  of the font on one line in addition to
	       its name.

       1m-ll	 22mLists font properties in addition to 1m-l 22moutput.

       1m-lll	 22mSupported for compatibility with 4mxlsfonts24m, but	 output	 is  the
	       same as for 1m-ll22m.

       1m-m	 22mThis  option indicates that long listings should also print the
	       minimum and maximum bounds of each font.

       1m-C	 22mThis option indicates that listings should	use  multiple  col-
	       umns.  This is the same as 1m-n 022m.

       1m-1	 22mThis option indicates that listings should use a single column.
	       This is the same as 1m-n 122m.

       1m-w 4m22mwidth0m
	       This option specifies the width in characters  that  should  be
	       used in figuring out how many columns to print.	The default is
	       79.

       1m-n 4m22mcolumns0m
	       This option specifies the number of columns to use in  display-
	       ing the output.	The default is 0, which will attempt to fit as
	       many columns of font names into the number of character	speci-
	       fied by 1m-w 4m22mwidth24m.

       1m-u	 22mThis  option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mfstobdf24m program reads a font from a font server and  prints  a	BDF
       file  on	 the  standard	output	that may be used to recreate the font.
       This is useful in testing servers, debugging font metrics,  and	repro-
       ducing lost BDF files.

gccmakedep(1)							 gccmakedep(1)



1mNAME0m
       gccmakedep - create dependencies in makefiles using 'gcc -M'

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mgccmakedep  22m[  1m-s4m22mseparator24m  ]  [	1m-f4m22mmakefile24m ] [ 1m-a 22m] [ -- 4moptions24m -- ]
       4msourcefile24m ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mgccmakedep 22mprogram calls 'gcc -M' to output 4mmakefile24m rules describ-
       ing  the	 dependencies  of each 4msourcefile24m, so that 1mmake22m(1) knows which
       object files must be recompiled when a dependency has changed.

       By default, 1mgccmakedep 22mplaces its output in the file named 4mmakefile24m  if
       it  exists, otherwise 4mMakefile.24m  An alternate makefile may be specified
       with the 1m-f 22moption.	 It first searches the makefile for a  line  begin-
       ning with

	   # DO NOT DELETE

       or  one	provided with the 1m-s 22moption, as a delimiter for the dependency
       output.	If it finds it, it will delete everything following this up to
       the  end	 of  the  makefile  and put the output after this line.	 If it
       doesn't find it, the program will append the string to the makefile and
       place the output after that.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       Normally,  1mgccmakedep	22mwill be used in a makefile target so that typing
       'make depend' will bring the dependencies up to date for the  makefile.
       For example,
	   SRCS = file1.c file2.c ...
	   CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz
	   depend:
		   gccmakedep -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)

1mOPTIONS0m
       The  program will ignore any option that it does not understand, so you
       may use the same arguments that you would for 1mgcc22m(1), including 1m-D  22mand
       1m-U  22moptions	 to  define  and undefine symbols and 1m-I 22mto set the include
       path.

       1m-a	22mAppend the dependencies to the file instead of replacing  exist-
	      ing dependencies.

       1m-f4m22mmakefile0m
	      Filename.	  This	allows you to specify an alternate makefile in
	      which 1mgccmakedep 22mcan place its output.  Specifying  "-"  as	the
	      file  name  (that	 is,  1m-f-22m) sends the output to standard output
	      instead of modifying an existing file.

       1m-s4m22mstring0m
	      Starting string delimiter.  This option permits you to specify a
	      different	 string	 for  1mgccmakedep  22mto look for in the makefile.
	      The default is "# DO NOT DELETE".

       1m-- 4m22moptions24m 1m--0m
	      If 1mgccmakedep 22mencounters a double hyphen (--)  in  the  argument
	      list,  then  any	unrecognized  arguments	 following  it will be
	      silently ignored.	 A second double hyphen terminates  this  spe-
	      cial  treatment.	 In this way, 1mgccmakedep 22mcan be made to safely
	      ignore esoteric compiler arguments that might normally be	 found
	      in a CFLAGS 1mmake 22mmacro (see the 1mEXAMPLE 22msection above).	 1m-D22m, 1m-I22m,
	      and 1m-U 22moptions appearing between the pair of double hyphens	are
	      still processed normally.

       1mglxinfo 22m[-t] [-v] [-b] [-display 4mdisplayname24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mglxinfo24m lists information about the GLX extension, OpenGL capable visu-
       als, and the OpenGL renderer on an X server. The GLX and renderer  info
       includes	 the  version  and extension attributes. The visual info lists
       the GLX visual attributes available  for	 each  OpenGL  capable	visual
       (e.g.  whether  the  visual is double buffered, the component sizes, Z-
       buffering depth, etc).

       Command line options include:

       1m-t	 22mBy default the visual info is presented in a concise 80 charac-
	       ter  wide tabular format. The -t option directs glxinfo to pro-

ICO(1)									ICO(1)



1mNAME0m
       ico - animate an icosahedron or other polyhedron

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mico 22m[-display display] [-geometry  geometry]  [-r]	[-d  pattern]  [-i]
       [-dbl] [-faces] [-noedges] [-sleep n] [-obj object] [-objhelp] [-colors
       color-list]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mIco24m displays  a  wire-frame	 rotating  polyhedron,	with  hidden  lines
       removed,	 or  a solid-fill polyhedron with hidden faces removed.	 There
       are a number of different polyhedra available; adding a new  polyhedron
       to the program is quite simple.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-r	22mDisplay on the root window instead of creating a new window.

       1m-d pattern0m
	      Specify  a bit pattern for drawing dashed lines for wire frames.

       1m-i	22mUse inverted colors for wire frames.

       1m-dbl	22mUse double buffering on the display.	 This works for either wire
	      frame  or	 solid	fill drawings.	For solid fill drawings, using
	      this switch results in substantially  smoother  movement.	  Note
	      that  this  requires  twice as many bit planes as without double
	      buffering.  Since some colors are typically allocated  by	 other
	      programs, most eight-bit-plane displays will probably be limited
	      to eight colors when using double buffering.

       1m-faces 22mDraw filled faces instead of wire frames.

       1m-noedges0m
	      Don't draw the wire frames.  Typically used only when -faces  is
	      used.

       1m-sleep 4m22mn0m
	      Sleep n seconds between each move of the object.

       1m-obj 4m22mobject0m
	      Specify  what  object  to	 draw.	 If no object is specified, an
	      icosahedron is drawn.

       1m-objhelp0m
	      Print out a list of the available objects, along	with  informa-
	      tion about each object.

       1m-colors 4m22mcolor24m 4mcolor24m 4m...0m
	      Specify  what  colors should be used to draw the filled faces of
	      the object.  If less colors than faces are given, the colors are
	      reused.

1mPROGRAM TREMINATION0m
       Pressing "q" will close a window. If compiled with threads support, the
       program will stop only when all threads terminate. You can  also	 close
       an  animation  window using the ICCCM 4mdelete24m message (depending on your
       window manager, you will have a decoration button or menu to send  such
       message).

1mADDING POLYHEDRA0m
       If  you	have the source to ico, it is very easy to add more polyhedra.
       Each polyhedron is defined in an include file by the name of  objXXX.h,
       where XXX is something related to the name of the polyhedron.  The for-
       mat of the include file is defined in the file polyinfo.h.  Look at the
       file  objcube.h to see what the exact format of an objXXX.h file should
       be, then create your objXXX.h file in that format.

       After making the new objXXX.h file (or copying in a new one from	 else-
       where),	simply	do  a  'make  depend'.	 This  will  recreate the file
       allobjs.h, which lists all of the objXXX.h files.  Doing a 'make' after
       this will rebuild ico with the new object information.

1mBUGS0m
       Pyramids and tetrahedrons with filled faces do not display correctly.

       A  separate  color cell is allocated for each name in the -colors list,
       even when the same name may be specified twice.	Color allocation fails
       in TrueColor displays and option 4m-faces24m does not work well.

IMAKE(1)							      IMAKE(1)



1mNAME0m
       imake - C preprocessor interface to the make utility

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mimake	22m[ 1m-D4m22mdefine24m ] [ 1m-I4m22mdir24m ] [ 1m-U4m22mdefine24m ] [ 1m-T4m22mtemplate24m ] [ 1m-f 4m22mfilename0m
       ] [ 1m-C 4m22mfilename24m ] [ 1m-s 4m22mfilename24m ] [ 1m-e 22m] [ 1m-v 22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mImake24m is used to generate 4mMakefiles24m from a template, a set of 4mcpp24m macro
       functions,  and	a  per-directory input file called an 4mImakefile24m.  This
       allows machine dependencies (such as compiler options,  alternate  com-
       mand  names,  and  special  4mmake24m  rules)  to  be kept separate from the
       descriptions of the various items to be built.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following command line options may be passed to 4mimake24m:

       1m-D4m22mdefine0m
	       This option is passed directly to 4mcpp24m.  It is typically used to
	       set  directory-specific	variables.   For example, the X Window
	       System uses this flag to set 4mTOPDIR24m to the name of	the  direc-
	       tory  containing the top of the core distribution and 4mCURDIR24m to
	       the name of the current directory, relative to the top.

       1m-I4m22mdirectory0m
	       This option is passed directly to 4mcpp24m.  It is typically used to
	       indicate the directory in which the 4mimake24m template and configu-
	       ration files may be found.

       1m-U4m22mdefine0m
	       This option is passed directly to 4mcpp24m.  It is typically used to
	       unset variables when debugging 4mimake24m configuration files.

       1m-T4m22mtemplate0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  name  of the master template file
	       (which is usually located in the directory specified  with  4m-I24m)
	       used by 4mcpp24m.  The default is 4mImake.tmpl24m.

       1m-f 4m22mfilename0m
	       This option specifies the name of the per-directory input file.
	       The default is 4mImakefile24m.

       1m-C 4m22mfilename0m
	       This option specifies the name of the  .c  file	that  is  con-
	       structed in the current directory.  The default is 4mImakefile.c24m.

       1m-s 4m22mfilename0m
	       This option specifies the name of the 4mmake24m description file	 to
	       be  generated  but 4mmake24m should not be invoked.  If the 4mfilename0m
	       is a dash (-), the output is written to 4mstdout24m.  The default is
	       to generate, but not execute, a 4mMakefile24m.

       1m-e	 22mThis  option  indicates  the 4mimake24m should execute the generated
	       4mMakefile24m.  The default is to leave this to the user.

       1m-v	 22mThis option indicates that 4mimake24m should print the  4mcpp24m  command
	       line that it is using to generate the 4mMakefile24m.

       1m-k	 22mThis  option  indicates that 4mimake24m should not remove the tempo-
	       rary .c file that it constructs.	 This is  for  debugging  pur-
	       poses.

1mHOW IT WORKS0m
       4mImake24m  invokes  4mcpp24m  with any 4m-I24m or 4m-D24m flags passed on the command line
       and passes the name of a file containing the following 3 lines:

		 #define IMAKE_TEMPLATE "Imake.tmpl"
		 #define INCLUDE_IMAKEFILE <Imakefile>
		 #include IMAKE_TEMPLATE

       where 4mImake.tmpl24m and 4mImakefile24m may be overridden by the 4m-T24m and 4m-f24m  com-
       mand options, respectively.

       The  IMAKE_TEMPLATE typically reads in a file containing machine-depen-
       dent parameters (specified as 4mcpp24m symbols), a site-specific	 parameters
       file,  a file defining variables, a file containing 4mcpp24m macro functions
       for generating 4mmake24m rules, and  finally  the  4mImakefile24m  (specified  by
       INCLUDE_IMAKEFILE)  in  the  current directory.	The 4mImakefile24m uses the
       macro functions to indicate what targets should be built;  4mimake24m  takes
       care of generating the appropriate rules.

       4mImake24m  configuration  files contain two types of variables, imake vari-
       ables and make variables.  The imake variables are interpreted  by  cpp
       when  4mimake24m is run.	 By convention they are mixed case.  The make vari-
       ables are written into the 4mMakefile24m for later interpretation  by  4mmake.0m
       By convention make variables are upper case.

       The  rules  file (usually named 4mImake.rules24m in the configuration direc-
       tory) contains a variety of 4mcpp24m macro  functions  that  are	 configured
       according  to  the current platform.  4mImake24m replaces any occurrences of
       the string ``@@'' with a newline to allow  macros  that	generate  more
       than one line of 4mmake24m rules.  For example, the macro

	#define	 program_target(program, objlist)	 @@\
	program: objlist				 @@\
		 $(CC)	-o  $@	objlist	 $(LDFLAGS)

       when called with 4mprogram_target(foo,24m 4mfoo1.o24m  4mfoo2.o)24m will expand to

	foo:	 foo1.o	 foo2.o
		 $(CC)	-o  $@	foo1.o	foo2.o	$(LDFLAGS)


       4mImake24m  also	 replaces  any	occurrences  of the word ``XCOMM'' with the
       character ``#'' to permit placing  comments  in	the  Makefile  without
       causing ``invalid directive'' errors from the preprocessor.

       Some  complex  4mimake24m  macros  require generated 4mmake24m variables local to
       each invocation of the macro, often  because  their  value  depends  on
       parameters passed to the macro.	Such variables can be created by using
       an 4mimake24m variable of the form 1mXVARdef4m22mn24m, where 4mn24m is a single	digit.	 A
       unique  4mmake24m  variable  will  be substituted.  Later occurrences of the
       variable 1mXVARuse4m22mn24m will be replaced by the variable created by the  cor-
       responding 1mXVARdef4m22mn24m.

       On  systems  whose  4mcpp24m  reduces  multiple	tabs and spaces to a single
       space, 4mimake24m attempts to put back any  necessary  tabs  (4mmake24m	is  very
       picky  about the difference between tabs and spaces).  For this reason,
       colons (:) in command lines must be preceded by a backslash (\).

1mUSE WITH THE X WINDOW SYSTEM0m
       The X Window System uses 4mimake24m extensively, for both full builds within
       the source tree and external software.  As mentioned above, two special
       variables, 4mTOPDIR24m and 4mCURDIR,24m are set to make referencing  files  using
       relative path names easier.  For example, the following command is gen-
       erated automatically to build the  4mMakefile24m	 in  the  directory  4mlib/X/0m
       (relative to the top of the sources):

		 %  ../.././config/imake  -I../.././config  \
		       -DTOPDIR=../../.	  -DCURDIR=./lib/X

       When building X programs outside the source tree, a special symbol 4mUse-0m
       4mInstalled24m is defined and 4mTOPDIR24m and 4mCURDIR24m are omitted.  If the config-
       uration	files have been properly installed, the script 4mxmkmf24m(1) may be
       used.

1mINPUT FILES0m
       Here is a summary of the files read by 4mimake24m as used by X.	The  inden-
       tation shows what files include what other files.

	   Imake.tmpl		     generic variables
	       site.def		     site-specific, BeforeVendorCF defined
	       *.cf		     machine-specific
		   *Lib.rules	     shared library rules
	       site.def		     site-specific, AfterVendorCF defined
	       Imake.rules	     rules
	       Project.tmpl	     X-specific variables
		   *Lib.tmpl	     shared library variables
	       Imakefile
		   Library.tmpl	     library rules
		   Server.tmpl	     server rules
		   Threads.tmpl	     multi-threaded rules

       Note  that  4msite.def24m gets included twice, once before the 4m*.cf24m file and
       once after.  Although most  site	 customizations	 should	 be  specified
       after  the  4m*.cf24m file, some, such as the choice of compiler, need to be
       specified before, because other variable settings may depend on them.

       The first time 4msite.def24m is included,  the  variable	 BeforeVendorCF	 is
       defined,	 and  the  second time, the variable AfterVendorCF is defined.
       All code in 4msite.def24m should be inside an #ifdef for one of	these  sym-
       bols.

1mFILES0m
       Imakefile.c		     temporary input file for cpp
       /tmp/Imf.XXXXXX		     temporary Makefile for -s
       /tmp/IIf.XXXXXX		     temporary	Imakefile  if specified Imake-

1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES0m
       The following environment variables may be set, however	their  use  is
       not  recommended	 as  they  introduce dependencies that are not readily
       apparent when 4mimake24m is run:

       1mIMAKEINCLUDE0m
	    If defined, this specifies a ``-I'' include argument  to  pass  to
	    the C preprocessor.	 E.g., ``-I/usr/X11/config''.

       1mIMAKECPP0m
	    If defined, this should be a valid path to a preprocessor program.
	    E.g., ``/usr/local/cpp''.  By default, 4mimake24m will  use	 cc  -E	 or
	    __cpp__, depending on the OS specific configuration.

       1mIMAKEMAKE0m
	    If defined, this should be a valid path to a make program, such as
	    ``/usr/local/make''.  By default, 4mimake24m  will	use  whatever  4mmake0m
	    program  is	 found using 4mexecvp(3).24m  This variable is only used if
	    the ``-e'' option is specified.

LBXPROXY(1)							   LBXPROXY(1)



1mNAME0m
       lbxproxy - Low BandWidth X proxy

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mlbxproxy [:<display>] [option]0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Applications  that  would  like	to take advantage of the Low Bandwidth
       extension to X (LBX) must make their connections to an lbxproxy.	 These
       applications need to know nothing about LBX, they simply connect to the
       lbxproxy as if were a regular server.  The lbxproxy accepts client con-
       nections,  multiplexes  them  over a single connection to the X server,
       and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make it	faster
       over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.

       With  regard  to	 authentication/authorization,	lbxproxy simply passes
       along to the server the credentials presented by the client.   Since  X
       clients will connect to lbxproxy, it is important that the user's .Xau-
       thority file contain entries with valid keys associated with  the  net-
       work  ID	 of  the proxy.	 lbxproxy does not get involved with how these
       entries are added to the .Xauthority file.  The user is responsible for
       setting it up.

       The lbxproxy program has various options, all of which are optional.

       If  1m:<display>	 22mis specified, the proxy will use the given display port
       when listening for connections.	The display port  is  an  offset  from
       port  6000, identical to the way in which regular X display connections
       are specified.  If no port is specified on  the	command	 line  option,
       lbxproxy	 will  default	to port 63.  If the port number that the proxy
       tries to listen on is in use, the proxy will  attempt  to  use  another
       port  number.   If  the	proxy  is  not using the Proxy Manager and the
       default port number cannot be used, the port number that is  used  will
       be written to stderr.

       The other command line options that can be specified are:


       1m-help	 22mPrints a brief help message about the command line options.

       1m-display 4m22mdpy0m
	       Specifies the address of the X server supporting the LBX exten-
	       sion.  If this option is not specified, the display is obtained
	       by the DISPLAY environment variable.

       1m-motion 4m22mcount0m
	       A  limited number of pointer motion events are allowed to be in
	       flight between the server and the proxy at any given time.  The
	       maximum	number	of  motion events that can be in flight is set
	       with this option; the default is 8.

       1m-maxservers 4m22mnumber0m
	       The default behavior of lbxproxy is to manage a single  server.
	       However, lbxproxy can manage more than one server.  The default
	       maximum number of servers is 20.	 The number of servers can  be
	       overridden   by	 setting   the	 environment   variable	  LBX-
	       PROXY_MAXSERVERS to the desired number.	The  order  of	prece-
	       dence  from  highest to lowest: command line, environment vari-
	       able, default number.

       1m-[terminate|reset]0m
	       The default behavior of lbxproxy	 is  to	 continue  running  as
	       usual  when it's last client exits.  The 1m-terminate 22moption will
	       cause lbxproxy to exit when the last client exits.  The	1m-reset0m
	       option will cause lbxproxy to reset itself when the last client
	       exits.  Resetting causes lbxproxy to clean up  it's  state  and
	       reconnect to the server.

       1m-reconnect0m
	       The default behavior of lbxproxy is to exit when its connection
	       to the server is broken.	 The 1m-reconnect 22moption will cause lbx-
	       proxy  to  just reset instead (see 1m-reset 22mabove) and attempt to
	       reconnect to the server.

       1m-I	 22mCauses all remaining arguments to be ignored.

       1m-nolbx	 22mDisables all LBX optimizations.

       1m-nocomp 22mDisables stream compression.

       1m-nodelta0m
	       Disables delta request substitutions.

       1m-notags 22mDisables usage of tags.

       1m-nogfx	 22mDisables reencoding of graphics requests (not  including  image
	       related requests).

       1m-noimage0m
	       Disables image compression.

       1m-nosquish0m
	       Disables squishing of X events.

       1m-nointernsc0m
	       Disables short circuiting of InternAtom requests.

       1m-noatomsfile0m
	       Disables reading of the atoms control file.  See the section on
	       "Atom Control" for more details.

       1m-atomsfile 4m22mfile0m
	       Overrides the default AtomControl file.	 See  the  section  on
	       "Atom Control" for more details.

       1m-nowinattr0m
	       Disables	  GetWindowAttributes/GetGeometry  grouping  into  one
	       round trip.

       1m-nograbcmap0m
	       Disables colormap grabbing.

       1m-norgbfile0m
	       Disables color name to RGB resolution in proxy.

       1m-rgbfile 4m22mpath0m
	       Specifies an alternate RGB database for color name to RGB reso-
	       lution.

       1m-tagcachesize0m
	       Set the size of the proxy's tag cache (in bytes).

       1m-zlevel 4m22mlevel0m
	       Set the Zlib compression level (used for stream compression).
	       default is 6
	       1 = worst compression, fastest
	       9 = best compression, slowest

       1m-compstats0m
	       Report  stream  compression  statistics	every  time  the proxy
	       resets or receives a SIGHUP signal.

       1m-nozeropad0m
	       Don't zero out unused pad bytes in  X  requests,	 replies,  and
	       events.

       1m-cheaterrors0m
	       Allows  cheating on X protocol for the sake of improved perfor-
	       mance.  The X protocol guarantees that any replies,  events  or
	       errors  generated  by  a	 previous  request will be sent before
	       those of a later request.  This puts  substantial  restrictions
	       on when lbxproxy can short circuit a request.  The -cheaterrors
	       option allows lbxproxy to violate X protocol rules with respect
	       to errors.  Use at your own risk.

       1m-cheatevents0m
	       The  -cheatevents  option allows lbxproxy to violate X protocol
	       rules with respect to events as well as errors.	 Use  at  your
	       own risk.


1mATOM CONTROL0m
       At  startup, lbxproxy "pre-interns" a configurable list of atoms.  This
       allows lbxproxy to intern a group of atoms in a single round  trip  and
       immediately store the results in its cache.

       While running, lbxproxy uses heuristics to decide when to delay sending
       window property data to the server.  The heuristics depend on the  size
       of  the data, the name of the property, and whether a window manager is
       running through the same lbxproxy.

       Atom control is specified in the	 "AtomControl"	file,  set  up	during
       installation of lbxproxy, with command line overrides.

       The  file  is a simple text file.  There are three forms of lines: com-
       ments, length control, and name control.	 Lines starting with a '!' are
       treated as comments.  A line of the form

	   z 4mlength0m

       specifies  the  minimum	length	in  bytes before property data will be
       delayed.	 A line of the form

	   4moptions24m 4matomname0m

       controls the given atom, where 4moptions24m is any combination of  the  fol-
       lowing  characters:  'i' means the atom should be pre-interned; and 'w'
       means data for properties with this name should be delayed  only	 if  a
       window manager is also running through the same lbxproxy.


1mBUGS0m
       When the authorization protocol XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is used:

	   A  client must be on the same host as lbxproxy for the client to be
	   authorized to connect to the server.

	   If a client is not on the same host as lbxproxy,  the  client  will
	   not be authorized to connect to the server.



LIBXRX(1)							     LIBXRX(1)



1mNAME0m
       libxrx - RX Netscape Navigator Plug-in

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  1mRX  Plug-in  22mmay be used with Netscape Navigator (3.0 or later) to
       interpret documents in the RX MIME type format and start remote	appli-
       cations.

       The  1mRX  Plug-in  22mreads  an RX document, from which it gets the list of
       services the application wants to use. Based on this  information,  the
       1mRX  Plug-in  22msets  the  various  requested services, including creating
       authorization keys if your X server supports the SECURITY extension. It
       then  passes  the  relevant  data,  such	 as the X display name, to the
       application through an HTTP GET request of the associated  CGI  script.
       The  Web	 server then executes the CGI script to start the application.
       The client runs on the web server host connected to your X  server.  In
       addition	 when the RX document is used within the EMBED tag (a Netscape
       extension to HTML), the 1mRX Plug-in 22muses the XC-APPGROUP  extension,	 if
       it is supported by your X server, to cause the remote application to be
       embedded within the browser page from which it was launched.


1mINSTALLATION0m
       To install the 1mRX Plug-in 22mso that Netscape Navigator can use  it,  find
       the file named libxrx.so.6.3 or libxrx.sl.6.3 (or similar, depending on
       your platform) in <ProjectRoot>/lib (e.g. /usr/X11R6.4/lib) and copy it
       to  either  /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins or $HOME/.netscape/plugins.
       Do not install the symlinks libxrx.so or libxrx.sl; they would  confuse
       Netscape.

       If  you have configured Netscape Navigator to use the RX helper program
       (1mxrx22m), you must reconfigure it. Generally you simply need to remove	 or
       comment out the line you may have previously added in your mailcap file
       to use the RX helper  program.	Otherwise  the	plug-in	 will  not  be
       enabled. (The usual comment character for mailcap is ``#''.)

       If  you	are  already  running Netscape Navigator, you need to exit and
       restart it after copying the plug-in library so the new plug-in will be
       found.  Once this is done you can check that Navigator has successfully
       loaded the plug-in by checking the ``About  Plug-ins''  page  from  the
       Help menu. This should show something like:

				   RX Plug-in

	   File name: /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins/libxrx.sl.6.3

	   X Remote Activation Plug-in

	   Mime Type	     Description		  Suffixes  Enabled
	   application/x-rx  X Remote Activation Plug-in  xrx	    Yes


       Once  correctly	configured,  Netscape  Navigator  will activate the 1mRX0m
       1mPlug-in 22mwhenever you retrieve any document of the  MIME  type  4mapplica-0m
       4mtion/x-rx24m.


1mRESOURCES0m
       The   1mRX  Plug-in  22mlooks  for  resources  associated  with	the  widget
       1mnetscape.Navigator (22mclass 1mNetscape.TopLevelShell) 22mand	understands  the
       following resource names and classes:

       1mxrxHasFirewallProxy (22mclass 1mXrxHasFirewallProxy)0m
	       Specifies whether an X server firewall proxy (see xfwp) is run-
	       ning and should be used. Default is ``False.''  The X  firewall
	       proxy  uses  the	 X  Security Extension and this extension will
	       only allow clients to connect to the  X	server	if  host-based
	       authentication is turned on.  See 1mxfwp(1) 22mfor more information.

       1mxrxInternalWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxInternalWebServers)0m
	       The web servers for which the X server  firewall	 proxy	should
	       not   be	  used	(only  relevant	 when  1mxrxHasFirewallProxy  22mis
	       ``True''). Its value is a comma separated  list	of  mask/value
	       pairs to be used to filter internal web servers, based on their
	       address. The mask part specifies which segments of the  address
	       are  to	be  considered	and  the value part specifies what the
	       result should match. For instance the following list:

		     255.255.255.0/198.112.45.0, 255.255.255.0/198.112.46.0

	       matches the address sets: 198.112.45.* and  198.112.46.*.  More
	       precisely, the test is (address & mask) == value.

       1mxrxFastWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxFastWebServers)0m
	       The  web servers for which LBX should not be used. The resource
	       value is a list of  address  mask/value	pairs,	as  previously
	       described.

       1mxrxTrustedWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxTrustedWebServers)0m
	       The web servers from which remote applications should be run as
	       trusted clients. The default is to run remote  applications  as
	       untrusted  clients.  The	 resource  value  is a list of address
	       mask/value pairs, as previously described.


1mENVIRONMENT0m
       If the RX document requests X-UI-LBX service and the default  X	server
       does  not advertise the LBX extension, the 4mRX24m 4mPlug-in24m will look for the
       environment variable ``XREALDISPLAY'' to get a second address for  your
       X  server  and  look  for  the  LBX  extension there. When running your
       browser through 4mlbxproxy24m you will  need  to	 set  XREALDISPLAY  to	the
       actual  address	of  your  server if you wish remote applications to be
       able to use LBX across the Internet.

       If the RX document requests XPRINT service, 4mRX24m 4mPlug-in24m	 looks	for  the
       variable	 ``XPRINTER''  to  get	the  printer  name  and X Print server
       address to use. If the server address  is  not  specified  as  part  of
       XPRINTER,  4mRX24m 4mPlug-in24m uses the first one specified through the variable
       ``XPSERVERLIST'' when it is set. When it is not 4mRX24m 4mPlug-in24m  then  tries
       to use the video server as the print server. If the printer name is not
       specified via XPRINTER, 4mRX24m	4mPlug-in24m  looks  for  it  in  the  variables
       ``PDPRINTER'', then ``LPDEST'', and finally ``PRINTER'',

       Finally,	 if  you  are using a firewall proxy, 4mRX24m 4mPlug-in24m will look for
       ``PROXY_MANAGER'' to get the address of your proxy manager (see proxym-
       ngr). When not specified it will use ":6500" as the default.


1mKNOWN BUG0m
       When  an	 authorization	key is created for a remote application to use
       the X Print service, the 1mRX Plug-in 22mhas to create the key with an infi-
       nite timeout since nobody knows when the application will actually con-
       nect to the X Print server. It then revokes the key when	 its  instance
       is  destroyed  (that  is	 when you go to another page). However, if the
       Plug-in does not get destroyed properly, which  happens	when  Netscape
       Navigator dies unexpectedly, the print authorization key will never get
       revoked.

LISTRES(1)							    LISTRES(1)



1mNAME0m
       listres - list resources in widgets

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mlistres 22m[-option ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mlistres24m  program generates a list of a widget's resource database.
       The class in which each resource is first  defined,  the	 instance  and
       class  name,  and  the type of each resource is listed.	If no specific
       widgets or the 4m-all24m switch are given, a two-column list of widget names
       and their class hierarchies is printed.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mListres24m  accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along
       with those listed below:

       1m-all	 22mThis option indicates that 4mlistres24m should print information for
	       all known widgets and objects.

       1m-nosuper0m
	       This  option indicates that resources that are inherited from a
	       superclass should not be listed.	 This is useful for  determin-
	       ing which resources are new to a subclass.

       1m-variable0m
	       This  option indicates that widgets should be identified by the
	       names of the class record variables rather than the class  name
	       given  in the variable.	This is useful for distinguishing sub-
	       classes that have the same class name as their superclasses.

       1m-top 4m22mname0m
	       This option specifies the name of the widget to be  treated  as
	       the  top	 of  the  hierarchy.  Case is not significant, and the
	       name may match either the class	variable  name	or  the	 class
	       name.  The default is ``core''.

       1m-format 4m22mprintf-string0m
	       This option specifies the 4mprintf24m-style format string to be used
	       to print out the	 name,	instance,  class,  and	type  of  each
	       resource.

1mX DEFAULTS0m

1mBUGS0m
       On  operating  systems  that do not support dynamic linking of run-time

LNDIR(1)							      LNDIR(1)



1mNAME0m
       lndir - create a shadow directory of symbolic links to  another	direc-
       tory tree

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mlndir 22m[ 4moptions24m ] 4mfromdir24m [ 4mtodir24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mlndir24m	program	 makes	a  shadow  copy	 4mtodir24m  of a directory tree
       4mfromdir,24m except that the shadow is not populated with  real	 files	but
       instead	with  symbolic links pointing at the real files in the 4mfromdir0m
       directory tree.	This is usually useful for maintaining source code for
       different  machine  architectures.   You create a shadow directory con-
       taining links to the real source, which you will have  usually  mounted
       from  a	remote	machine.   You	can  build in the shadow tree, and the
       object files will be in the shadow directory, while the source files in
       the shadow directory are just symlinks to the real files.

       This  scheme  has the advantage that if you update the source, you need
       not propagate the change to the other architectures by hand, since  all
       source  in  all shadow directories are symlinks to the real thing: just
       cd to the shadow directory and recompile away.

       The 4mtodir24m argument is optional and defaults to the	current	 directory.
       The  4mfromdir24m argument may be relative (e.g., ../src) and is relative to
       4mtodir24m (not the current directory).

       If you add files, simply run 4mlndir24m again.  New files will  be  silently
       added.  Old files will be checked that they have the correct link.

       Deleting	 files is a more painful problem; the symlinks will just point
       into never-never land.

1mOPTIONS0m
       -silent
	      Normally 4mlndir24m outputs the  name  of	 each  subdirectory  as	 it
	      descends	into  it.   The 1m-silent 22moption suppresses these status
	      messages.	 1m-silent 22mmay be abbreviated to 1m-s22m.

       -ignorelinks
	      If a file in 4mfromdir24m is a symbolic link,  4mlndir24m	 will  make  the
	      same  link  in 4mtodir24m rather than making a link back to the (sym-
	      bolic link) entry in 4mfromdir.24m  The 1m-ignorelinks  22moption	 changes
	      this behavior.  The link created in 4mtodir24m will point back to the
	      corresponding (symbolic link) file in 4mfromdir24m.  If the  link	 is
	      to  a  directory, this is almost certainly the wrong thing.  The
	      1m-ignorelinks 22moption may be abbreviated to 1m-i22m.

       -withsymdirs
	      If a file in 4mfromdir24m is a symbolic link to a directory  and	the
	      1m-withsymdirs  22moption	 is specified, 4mlndir24m will shadow the direc-
	      tory tree the symbolic  link  points  to,	 whether  or  not  the
	      1m-ignorelinks  22mis also specified.  The 1m-withsymdirs 22moption may be
	      abbreviated to 1m-d22m.

       -clean 4mlndir24m will remove dangling symbolic links and empty	directories
	      in the shadow tree.  The 1m-clean 22moption may be abbreviated to 1m-c22m.

       -cleanonly
	      4mlndir24m will do the cleaning phase only, not creating	the  shadow
	      tree.   The  4mtodir24m argument may be provided, and defaults to the
	      current directory when not provided.

       -withrevinfo
	      4mlndir24m will normally not shadow any BitKeeper,  RCS,	SCCS,  CVS,
	      CVS.adm  and .svn subdirectories, nor any .cvsignore and .gitig-
	      nore files.  This option causes these directories and  files  to
	      be  treated as any other, rather than ignored.  1m-withrevinfo 22mmay
	      be shortened to 1m-r22m.

       -noexceptions
	      By default, 4mlndir24m does not shadow  files  or	 directories  whose
	      name  is .DS_Store, or ._.DS_Store, or starts with '.#', or ends
	      in '~'.  This option, which may be  abbreviated  to  1m-E22m,  causes
	      such files to also be shadowed.

       -except
	      This option adds 4mname24m to an initially empty list of filenames in
	      4mfromdir24m that are not to be shadowed.	 1m-except 22mmay  be  specified
	      as  1m-e22m.  This option may be repeated as many times as necessary.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       The program displays the name of each subdirectory it enters,  followed
       by a colon.  The 1m-silent 22moption suppresses these messages.

       A  warning message is displayed if the symbolic link cannot be created.
       The usual problem is that a regular  file  of  the  same	 name  already
       exists.

       If  the	link already exists but doesn't point to the correct file, the
       program prints the link name and the location to which it does point.

       1mLuit 22mis a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
       UTF-8  terminal	emulator.  It will convert application output from the
       locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert  terminal  input  from	 UTF-8
       into the locale's encoding.

       An  application may also request switching to a different output encod-
       ing using ISO 2022 and ISO 6429 escape sequences.  Use of this  feature
       is   discouraged:  multilingual	applications  should  be  modified  to
       directly generate UTF-8 instead.

       1mLuit 22mis usually invoked transparently by the  terminal  emulator.	For
       information  about  running  1mluit  22mfrom  the command line, see EXAMPLES
       below.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-h	22mDisplay some summary help and quit.

       1m-list	22mList the supported charsets and encodings, then quit.

       1m-v	22mBe verbose.

       1m-c	22mFunction as a simple converter from standard input  to  standard
	      output.

       1m-x	22mExit	 as  soon  as the child dies.  This may cause 1mluit 22mto loose
	      data at the end of the child's output.

       1m-argv0 4m22mname0m
	      Set the child's name (as passed in argv[0]).

       1m-encoding 4m22mencoding0m
	      Set up 1mluit 22mto use 4mencoding24m rather  than  the  current	locale's
	      encoding.

       1m+oss	22mDisable interpretation of single shifts in application output.

       1m+ols	22mDisable  interpretation of locking shifts in application output.

       1m+osl	22mDisable interpretation of character set selection  sequences	 in
	      application output.

       1m+ot	22mDisable  interpretation  of all sequences and pass all sequences
	      in application output to the terminal unchanged.	This may  lead
	      to interesting results.

       1m-k7	22mGenerate seven-bit characters for keyboard input.

       1m+kss	22mDisable generation of single-shifts for keyboard input.

       1m+kssgr 22mUse	GL  codes  after  a  single  shift  for keyboard input.	 By
	      default, GR codes are generated after a single shift when gener-
	      ating eight-bit keyboard input.

       1m-kls	22mGenerate locking shifts (SO/SI) for keyboard input.

       1m-gl 4m22mgn24m Set the initial assignment of GL.  The argument should be one of
	      1mg022m, 1mg122m, 1mg2 22mor 1mg322m.  The default depends on  the  locale,  but	is
	      usually 1mg022m.

       1m-gr 4m22mgk24m Set  the  initial  assignment of GR.  The default depends on the
	      locale, and is usually 1mg2 22mexcept for EUC locales,  where  it	 is
	      1mg122m.

       1m-g0 4m22mcharset0m
	      Set  the	charset initially selected in G0.  The default depends
	      on the locale, but is usually 1mASCII22m.

       1m-g1 4m22mcharset0m
	      Set the charset initially selected in G1.	 The  default  depends
	      on the locale.

       1m-g2 4m22mcharset0m
	      Set  the	charset initially selected in G2.  The default depends
	      on the locale.

       1m-g3 4m22mcharset0m
	      Set the charset initially selected in G3.	 The  default  depends
	      on the locale.

       1m-ilog 4m22mfilename0m
	      Log into 4mfilename24m all the bytes received from the child.

       1m-olog 4m22mfilename0m
	      Log into 4mfilename24m all the bytes sent to the terminal emulator.

       1m--	22mEnd of options.

1mEXAMPLES0m
       The  most  typical  use of 1mluit 22mis to adapt an instance of 1mXTerm 22mto the
       locale's encoding.  Current versions of 1mXTerm 22minvoke 1mluit 22mautomatically
       when  it	 is  needed.  If you are using an older release of 1mXTerm22m, or a
       different terminal emulator, you may invoke 1mluit 22mmanually:

	      $ xterm -u8 -e luit

       If you are running in a UTF-8  locale  but  need	 to  access  a	remote
       machine that doesn't support UTF-8, 1mluit 22mcan adapt the remote output to
       your terminal:

	      $ LC_ALL=fr_FR luit ssh legacy-machine

       1mLuit 22mis also useful with applications that hard-wire an  encoding  that
       is  different  from  the one normally used on the system or want to use
       legacy escape sequences for multilingual output.	 In  particular,  ver-
       sions  of 1mEmacs 22mthat do not speak UTF-8 well can use 1mluit 22mfor multilin-
       gual output:

	      $ luit -encoding 'ISO 8859-1' emacs -nw

       And then, in 1mEmacs22m,

	      M-x set-terminal-coding-system RET iso-2022-8bit-ss2 RET


1mFILES0m
       1m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/encodings/encodings.dir0m
	      The system-wide encodings directory.

       1m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias0m
	      The file mapping locales to locale encodings.

1mSECURITY0m
       On systems with SVR4 (``Unix-98'') ptys (Linux version 2.2  and	later,
       SVR4), 1mluit 22mshould be run as the invoking user.

       On systems without SVR4 (``Unix-98'') ptys (notably BSD variants), run-
       ning 1mluit 22mas an ordinary user will leave the tty  world-writable;  this
       is  a security hole, and luit will generate a warning (but still accept
       to run).	 A possible solution is to make 1mluit 22msuid	root;  1mluit  22mshould
       drop  privileges	 sufficiently  early  to make this safe.  However, the
       startup code has not been exhaustively audited, and the author takes no
       responsibility for any resulting security issues.

       1mLuit  22mwill	refuse	to  run if it is installed setuid and cannot safely
       drop privileges.

1mBUGS0m
       None of this complexity should be necessary.  Stateless UTF-8  through-
       out the system is the way to go.

       Charsets with a non-trivial intermediary byte are not yet supported.

       Selecting  alternate  sets  of  control characters is not supported and
       will never be.

MAKEPSRES(1)							  MAKEPSRES(1)



1mNAME0m
       makepsres - Build PostScript resource database file.


1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mmakepsres 22m[ 4moptions24m ] 4mdirectory24m 4m...0m


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mmakepsres  22mcreates	PostScript  language   resource	  database   files.
       Resource	 database  files  can  be  used	 to  specify  the  location of
       resources that are used by the font selection  panel  and  other	 Adobe
       software.   For a complete description of the resource location facili-
       ties in the Display PostScript system, see Appendix A and Appendix B of
       "Display	 PostScript  Toolkit  for  X" in 4mProgramming24m 4mthe24m 4mDisplay24m 4mPost-0m
       4mScript24m 4mSystem24m 4mwith24m 4mX.0m

       1mmakepsres 22mcreates a resource database file named  4mPSres.upr24m  that  con-
       tains  all  the	resources in all the 4mdirectory24m path names specified on
       the command line.

	 If the list of directories contains 1m- , makepsres  22mreads	from  4mstdin0m
	 and  expects  a  list of directories separated by space, tab, or new-
	 line.

	 If the list of directories is empty, it is taken to  be  the  current
	 directory.

	 If  all specified directories have a common initial prefix, 1mmakepsres0m
	 extracts it as a directory prefix in the new resource database	 file.

       1mmakepsres  22mnormally	 acts  recursively;  it looks for resource files in
       subdirectories of any specified directory. This behavior can  be	 over-
       ridden with the command line option 1m-nr.0m

       1mmakepsres  22muses existing resource database files to assist in identify-
       ing files. By default, 1mmakepsres 22mcreates a new resource  database  file
       containing all of the following that apply:

	 Resource files found in the directories on the command line.

	 Resource  files  pointed  to  by  the	resource database files in the
	 directories on the command line.

	 Resource entries found in the input resource  database	 files.	 These
	 entries  are  copied  if  the	files they specify still exist and are
	 located in directories not specified on the command line.

       If you run 1mmakepsres 22min discard mode (with the 1m-d 22moption), it does  not
       copy  resource  entries from the input resource database files. In that
       case, the output file consists only of entries from the directories  on
       the  command  line.  The input resource database files are only used to
       assist in identifying files.

       If you run 1mmakepsres 22min keep mode (with the 1m-k 22moption), it includes  in
       the  output  file  all  resource entries in the input resource database
       files, even entries for files that no longer exist or  are  located  in
       directories specified on the command line.

       1mmakepsres  22muses various heuristics to identify files. A file that is of
       a private resource type or that does not conform to the standard format
       for a resource file must be specified in one of the following ways:

	 By running 1mmakepsres 22min interactive mode

	 By preloading the file into a resource database file used for input

	 By beginning the file with the following line:

	    %!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-<resource-type>


1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-o 4m22mfilename0m
	      Writes  the  output to the specified filename.  The construction
	      "1m-o -22m" writes to stdout. If the  1m-o  22moption  is	 not  specified,
	      1mmakepsres  22mcreates a 4mPSres.upr24m file in the current directory and
	      writes the output to that file.

       1m-f 4m22mfilename0m
	      Uses information from the specified file to assist  in  resource
	      typing.	The  file  must	 be  in resource database file format.
	      Multiple 1m-f 22moptions may be specified. The  construction  "1m-f  -22m"
	      uses 4mstdin24m as an input file and may not be used if "1m-22m" is speci-
	      fied as a directory on the command line.

       1m-dir 4m22mdirname0m
	      Specifies that 4mdirname24m is a directory. Needed only in rare cases
	      when 4mdirname24m is the same as a command-line option such as 1m-nb.0m

       1m-d	22mSpecifies  discard  mode.  The  resulting  output  file consists
	      solely of entries from the directories on the command line.

       1m-e	22mMarks the resulting 4mPSres.upr24m file as  exclusive.   This  option
	      makes  the  resource  location library run more quickly since it
	      does not have to look for	 other	resource  database  files.  It
	      becomes  necessary,  however,  to	 run  1mmakepsres  22mwhenever	new
	      resources are added to the directory, even if the resources come
	      with their own resource database file.

       1m-i	22mSpecifies  interactive  mode.  In  interactive mode, you will be
	      queried for the resource	type  of  any  encountered  file  that
	      1mmakepsres  22mcannot  identify.	  If 1m-i 22mis not specified, 1mmakepsres0m
	      assumes an unidentifiable file is not a resource file.

       1m-k	22mSpecifies keep mode.

       1m-nb	22mIf the output file already exists, do not back it up.

       1m-nr	22mSpecifies nonrecursive mode.	  1mmakepsres  22mnormally  acts  recur-
	      sively:  it  looks  for  resource files in subdirectories of any
	      specified directory. If 1m-nr 22mis used, 1mmakepsres 22mdoes not look  in
	      subdirectories for resource files.

       1m-p	22mSpecifies  no  directory  prefix.  If 1m-p 22mis used, 1mmakepsres 22mdoes
	      not try to find a common directory prefix	 among	the  specified
	      directories.

       1m-q	22mQuiet  mode:	 ignores  unidentifiable  files	 instead of warning
	      about them.

       1m-s	22mSpecifies strict mode.  If 1m-s 22mis used, 1mmakepsres 22mterminates with
	      an error if it encounters a file it cannot identify.


1mEXAMPLES0m
       1mmakepsres .0m
	      Creates a resource database file that contains all the resources
	      in the current directory.

       1mmakepsres -i -o local.upr /usr/local/lib/ps/fonts0m
	      Runs 1mmakepsres 22min interactive mode and creates a resource  data-
	      base  file  named 4mlocal.upr,24m which contains all the resources in
	      the directory 4m/usr/local/lib/ps/fonts.0m

1mNAME0m
       makestrs - makes string table C source and header(s)

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mmakestrs [-f source] [-abioptions ...]0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mmakestrs24m  command creates string table C source files and headers.
       If 4m-f24m 4msource24m is not specified 4mmakestrs24m will read	from  4mstdin.24m   The	 C
       source  file is always written to 4mstdout.24m  4mmakestrs24m creates one or more
       C header files as specified in the source file.	The following  options
       may be specified: 4m-sparcabi,24m 4m-intelabi,24m 4m-functionabi,24m 4m-arrayperabi,24m and
       4m-defaultabi.0m

       4m-sparcabi24m is used on SPARC platforms conforming to the SPARC Compliance
       Definition, i.e. SVR4/Solaris.

       4m-intelabi24m  is used on Intel platforms conforming to the System V Appli-
       cation Binary Interface, i.e. SVR4.

       4m-earlyR6abi24m may be used in addition to 4m-intelabi24m for  situations  where
       the  vendor  wishes to maintain binary compatibility between X11R6 pub-
       lic-patch 11 (and earlier) and X11R6 public-patch 12 (and later).

       4m-functionabi24m generates a functional abi to the string table. This mech-
       anism  imposes  a  severe performance penalty and it's recommended that
       you not use it.

       4m-arrayperabi24m results in a separate array for each string. This  is	the
       default behavior if makestrs was compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR (it almost
       never is).

       4m-defaultabi24m forces the generation of the "normal" string table even	 if
       makestrs	 was  compiled	with  -DARRAYPERSTR.  Since makestrs is almost
       never compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR this is the default  behavior	if  no
       abioptions are specified.

1mSYNTAX0m
       The  syntax  for	 string-list  file  is	(items	in square brackets are
       optional):
	   #prefix <text>
	   #feature <text>
	   #externref <text>
	   #externdef [<text>]
	   [#ctempl <text>]

	   #file <filename>
	   #table <tablename>
	   [#htempl]
	   <text>
	   <text>
	   [#table <tablename>
	   <text>
	   <text>
	    ...
	   #table <tablename>
	    ...]
	   [#file <filename>
	    ...]

       In words you may have one or more #file directives. Each #file may have
       one or more #table directives.

       The #prefix directive determines the string that makestr will prefix to
       each definition.

       The #feature directive determines the string that makestr will use  for
       the feature-test macro, e.g. X[TM]STRINGDEFINES.

       The  #externref	directive  determines the string that makestr will use
       for the extern clause, typically this will be "extern" but Motif	 wants
       it to be "externalref"

       The  #externdef	directive  determines the string that makestr will use
       for the declaration, typically this will be the null string (note  that
       makestrs	 requires  a trailing space in this case, i.e. "#externdef "),
       and Motif will use "externaldef(_xmstrings).

       The #ctmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
       for the C source file that is generated

       Each  #file  <filename> directive will result in a corresponding header
       file by that name containing the appropriate definitions	 as  specified
       by command line options. A single C source file containing the declara-
       tions for the definitions in all the headers will be printed to stdout.

       The #htmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
       for the C header file that is generated.

       Each #table <tablename> directive will be processed in accordance  with
       the  ABI.  On most platforms all tables will be catenated into a single
       table with the name of the first table for that file. To conform to the
       Intel ABI separate tables will be generated with the names indicated.

       The  template  files  specified by the #ctmpl and #htmpl directives are
       processed by copying line for line from the template file to the appro-
       priate  output  file.  The  line	 containing  the  string 4m<<<STRING_TA-0m
       4mBLE_GOES_HERE>>>24m is not copied to the output file. The appropriate data
       is  then	 copied	 to the output file and then the remainder of the tem-
       plate file is copied to the output file.

1mBUGS0m
       makestrs is not very forgiving of syntax errors. Sometimes you  need  a
       trailing	 space	after # directives, other times they will mess you up.
       No warning messages are emitted.

       4mfile24m ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mmakedepend 22mprogram reads each 4msourcefile24m in sequence and parses  it
       like  a	C-preprocessor,	 processing  all  4m#include,24m  4m#define,24m	 4m#undef,0m
       4m#ifdef,24m 4m#ifndef,24m 4m#endif,24m 4m#if,24m 4m#elif24m and 4m#else24m directives so that it can
       correctly  tell	which 4m#include,24m directives would be used in a compila-
       tion.  Any  4m#include,24m  directives  can  reference  files  having  other
       4m#include24m directives, and parsing will occur in these files as well.

       Every  file that a 4msourcefile24m includes, directly or indirectly, is what
       1mmakedepend 22mcalls a 4mdependency.24m	 These dependencies are then written  to
       a 4mmakefile24m in such a way that 1mmake(1) 22mwill know which object files must
       be recompiled when a dependency has changed.

       By default, 1mmakedepend 22mplaces its output in the file named 4mmakefile24m  if
       it  exists, otherwise 4mMakefile.24m  An alternate makefile may be specified
       with the 1m-f 22moption.	 It first searches the makefile for the line

	   # DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE -- make depend depends on it.

       or one provided with the 1m-s 22moption, as a delimiter for  the	 dependency
       output.	 If  it	 finds it, it will delete everything following this to
       the end of the makefile and put the output  after  this	line.	If  it
       doesn't	find  it, the program will append the string to the end of the
       makefile and place the output  following	 that.	 For  each  4msourcefile0m
       appearing on the command line, 1mmakedepend 22mputs lines in the makefile of
       the form

	    sourcefile.o: dfile ...

       Where 4msourcefile.o24m is the name from the command line  with	its  suffix
       replaced	 with  ``.o'',	and  4mdfile24m	 is  a	dependency  discovered in a
       4m#include24m directive while parsing 4msourcefile24m or	 one  of  the  files  it
       included.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       Normally,  1mmakedepend	22mwill be used in a makefile target so that typing
       ``make depend'' will bring the dependencies up to date  for  the	 make-
       file.  For example,
	   SRCS = file1.c file2.c ...
	   CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz
	   depend:
		   makedepend -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)

1mOPTIONS0m
       The  program will ignore any option that it does not understand so that
       you may use the same arguments that you would for 1mcc(1).0m

       1m-D4m22mname24m1m=4m22mdef24m or 1m-D4m22mname0m
	    Define.  This places a definition for 4mname24m in 1mmakedepend's  22msymbol
	    table.  Without 4m=def24m the symbol becomes defined as ``1''.

       1m-I4m22mincludedir0m
	    Include  directory.	  This	option	tells  1mmakedepend  22mto  prepend
	    4mincludedir24m to its list of directories to search when it encounters
	    a  4m#include24m  directive.   By default, 1mmakedepend 22monly searches the
	    standard include directories (usually /usr/include and possibly  a
	    compiler-dependent directory).

       1m-Y4m22mincludedir0m
	    Replace  all  of  the standard include directories with the single
	    specified include directory; you can omit the 4mincludedir24m to simply
	    prevent searching the standard include directories.

       1m-a   22mAppend	 the dependencies to the end of the file instead of replac-
	    ing them.

       1m-f4m22mmakefile0m
	    Filename.  This allows you to specify  an  alternate  makefile  in
	    which  1mmakedepend	 22mcan	 place its output.  Specifying ``-'' as the
	    file name (i.e., 1m-f-22m) sends the output to standard output  instead
	    of modifying an existing file.

       1m-include 4m22mfile0m
	    Process file as input, and include all the resulting output before
	    processing the regular input file. This has the same affect as  if
	    the specified file is an include statement that appears before the
	    very first line of the regular input file.

       1m-o4m22mobjsuffix0m
	    Object file suffix.	 Some systems may have object files whose suf-
	    fix	 is  something	other  than ``.o''.  This option allows you to
	    specify another suffix, such as ``.b'' with 4m-o.b24m or ``:obj''  with
	    4m-o:obj24m and so forth.

       1m-p4m22mobjprefix0m
	    Object  file  prefix.   The prefix is prepended to the name of the
	    object file. This is usually used to designate a different	direc-
	    tory for the object file.  The default is the empty string.

       1m-s4m22mstring0m
	    Starting  string  delimiter.  This option permits you to specify a
	    different string for 1mmakedepend 22mto look for in the makefile.

       1m-w4m22mwidth0m
	    Line width.	 Normally, 1mmakedepend 22mwill ensure	that  every  output
	    line  that	it  writes will be no wider than 78 characters for the
	    sake of readability.  This	option	enables	 you  to  change  this
	    width.

       1m-v   22mVerbose operation.  This option causes 1mmakedepend 22mto emit the list
	    of files included by each input file.

       1m-m   22mWarn about multiple inclusion.	 This option causes  1mmakedepend  22mto
	    produce  a	warning	 if  any input file includes another file more
	    than once.	In  previous  versions	of  1mmakedepend  22mthis  was	the
	    default behavior; the default has been changed to better match the
	    behavior of the C  compiler,  which	 does  not  consider  multiple
	    inclusion  to  be  an error.  This option is provided for backward
	    compatibility, and to aid in debugging problems related to	multi-
	    ple inclusion.

       1m-- 4m22moptions24m 1m--0m
	    If	1mmakedepend  22mencounters  a	double	hyphen (--) in the argument
	    list, then any unrecognized argument following it will be silently
	    ignored; a second double hyphen terminates this special treatment.
	    In this way, 1mmakedepend 22mcan be made to safely ignore esoteric com-
	    piler  arguments  that  might  normally  be found in a CFLAGS 1mmake0m
	    macro (see the 1mEXAMPLE 22msection above).	 All options  that  1mmakede-0m
	    1mpend  22mrecognizes and appear between the pair of double hyphens are
	    processed normally.

1mALGORITHM0m
       The approach used in this program enables it to run an order of	magni-
       tude  faster  than any other ``dependency generator'' I have ever seen.
       Central to this performance are two assumptions: that  all  files  com-
       piled  by  a  single makefile will be compiled with roughly the same 4m-I0m
       and 4m-D24m options; and that most files in a single directory will  include
       largely the same files.

       Given  these assumptions, 1mmakedepend 22mexpects to be called once for each
       makefile, with all source files that are	 maintained  by	 the  makefile
       appearing  on the command line.	It parses each source and include file
       exactly once, maintaining an internal symbol table for each.  Thus, the
       first file on the command line will take an amount of time proportional
       to the amount of time that a normal C preprocessor takes.  But on  sub-
       sequent	files,	if  it	encounters an include file that it has already
       parsed, it does not parse it again.

       For example, imagine you are compiling two files, 4mfile1.c24m and  4mfile2.c,0m
       they  each  include  the header file 4mheader.h,24m and the file 4mheader.h24m in
       turn includes the files 4mdef1.h24m and 4mdef2.h.24m  When you run the command

	   makedepend file1.c file2.c

       1mmakedepend 22mwill parse  4mfile1.c24m	 and  consequently,  4mheader.h24m  and	 then
       4mdef1.h24m and 4mdef2.h.24m  It then decides that the dependencies for this file
       are

	   file1.o: header.h def1.h def2.h

       But when the  program  parses  4mfile2.c24m  and	 discovers  that  it,  too,
       includes	 4mheader.h,24m	 it  does  not	parse  the  file,  but	simply adds
       4mheader.h,24m 4mdef1.h24m and 4mdef2.h24m to the list of dependencies for 4mfile2.o.0m

1mBUGS0m
       1mmakedepend 22mparses, but does not currently evaluate,	 the  SVR4  #predi-
       cate(token-list)	 preprocessor  expression; such expressions are simply
       assumed to be true.  This may cause the wrong 4m#include24m directives to be
       evaluated.

       Imagine	you  are  parsing  two	files,	say  4mfile1.c24m and 4mfile2.c,24m each
       includes the file 4mdef.h.24m  The list of files that 4mdef.h24m	 includes  might
       truly  be  different  when 4mdef.h24m is included by 4mfile1.c24m than when it is
       included by 4mfile2.c.24m  But once 1mmakedepend 22marrives at a list  of  depen-
       dencies for a file, it is cast in concrete.

       mkcfm - create summaries of font metric files in CID font directories

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mmkcfm 22m[4mCID-font-directory-name24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       There  is usually only one CID font directory on the X font path. It is
       usually called 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID24m. If you do not	specify	 an
       argument,  4mmkcfm24m  will  try	 to  go	 through the subdirectories of that
       directory, and create one summary of font metric files for each CIDFont
       (character  descriptions)  file	and each CMap (Character Maps) file it
       finds. The summaries of font metric files are put in the	 existing  CFM
       subdirectory.  The  CFM subdirectories are created when CID-keyed fonts
       are installed.

       If you specify a CID font directory as an argument, 4mmkcfm24m will  try	 to
       go through the subdirectories of that directory, and create one summary
       of font metric files for each CIDFont file and each CMap file it finds.
       4mmkcfm24m  will	 calculate the summaries of the font metric files stored in
       AFM subdirectories of the CID font directory.

       Those summaries are needed by the  rasterizer  of  CID-keyed  fonts  to
       speed up the response to X font calls. If those files do not exist, CID
       rasterizer will have to go through usually large font metric files, and
       calculate  the  summaries itself each time the font is called. You will
       notice a substantial wait on a call to a large CID-keyed font.

1mFILES0m
       1m.afm files	22mEach CID-keyed font file is supposed to have a font met-
		      ric  file (.afm file). 4mmkcfm24m creates summary files (.cfm
		      files) of those font metric files. 4mmkcfm24m should  be	run
		      whenever	a  change  is  made to the files stored in the
		      subdirectories of the CID font directory.	 For  example,
		      it should be run when new CID fonts are installed.

       mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a directory

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mmkfontdir  22m[1m-n22m]  [1m-x	 4m22msuffix24m]  [1m-r22m] [1m-p 4m22mprefix24m] [1m-e 4m22mencoding-directory-0m
       4mname24m] ...  [1m--22m] [4mdirectory-name24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       For each directory argument, 4mmkfontdir24m reads all of the font  files	 in
       the  directory searching for properties named "FONT", or (failing that)
       the name of the file stripped of its suffix.  These  are	 converted  to
       lower case and used as font names, and, along with the name of the font
       file, are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the directory.	The  X
       server and font server use "fonts.dir" to find font files.

       The  kinds  of  font  files  read  by 4mmkfontdir24m depend on configuration
       parameters, but typically include  PCF  (suffix	".pcf"),  SNF  (suffix
       ".snf") and BDF (suffix ".bdf").	 If a font exists in multiple formats,
       4mmkfontdir24m will first choose PCF, then SNF and finally BDF.

       The first line of fonts.dir gives the number of fonts in the file.  The
       remaining lines list the fonts themselves, one per line, in two fields.
       First is the name of the font file, followed by a space and the name of
       the font.

1mSCALABLE FONTS0m
       Because scalable font files do not usually include the X font name, the
       file "fonts.scale" can be used to name the scalable fonts in the direc-
       tory.   The  fonts  listed  in it are copied to fonts.dir by 4mmkfontdir24m.
       "fonts.scale" has the same format as the "fonts.dir" file.

1mFONT NAME ALIASES0m
       The file "fonts.alias", which can be put in any directory of the	 font-
       path,  is used to map new names to existing fonts, and should be edited
       by hand.	 The format is two white-space separated  columns,  the	 first
       containing aliases and the second containing font-name patterns.	 Lines
       beginning with "!" are comment lines and are ignored.

       If neither the alias nor the value specifies the	 size  fields  of  the
       font  name,  this  is  a	 scalable alias.  A font name of any size that
       matches this alias will be mapped to the same size of the font that the
       alias resolves to.

       When  a	font  alias is used, the name it references is searched for in
       the normal manner, looking through each font directory in  turn.	  This
       means  that the aliases need not mention fonts in the same directory as
       the alias file.

       To embed white space in either name, simply enclose it in  double-quote
       marks;  to  embed  double-quote marks (or any other character), precede
       them with back-slash:

       "magic-alias with spaces"     "\"font name\" with quotes"
       regular-alias		fixed

       If the string "FILE_NAMES_ALIASES" stands alone on a line,  each	 file-
       name in the directory (stripped of its suffix) will be used as an alias
       for that font.

1mENCODING FILES0m
       The option 1m-e 22mcan be used to specify a directory with  encoding  files.
       Every  such  directory is scanned for encoding files, the list of which
       is then written to an "encodings.dir" file  in  every  font  directory.
       The  "encodings.dir" file is used by the server to find encoding infor-
       mation.

       The "encodings.dir" file has the same format as "fonts.dir".   It  maps
       encoding names (strings of the form 1mCHARSET_REGISTRY4m22m-24m1mCHARSET_ENCODING 22m)
       to encoding file names.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options are supported:

       1m-e	22mSpecify a directory containing encoding files.   The	 1m-e  22moption
	      may  be specified multiple times, and all the specified directo-
	      ries will be read.  The order of the entries is significant,  as
	      encodings	 found	in earlier directories override those in later
	      ones; encoding files in the same directory are discriminated  by
	      preferring compressed versions.

       1m-n	22mdo  not scan for fonts, do not write font directory files.  This
	      option is useful when generating encoding directories only.

       1m-p	22mSpecify a prefix that is prepended to  the  encoding	 file  path
	      names  when  they	 are written to the "encodings.dir" file.  The
	      prefix is prepended as-is.  If a `/'  is	required  between  the
	      prefix  and  the	path  names, it must be supplied explicitly as
	      part of the prefix.

       1m-r	22mKeep non-absolute encoding directories in  their  relative  form
	      when  writing  the "encodings.dir" file.	The default is to con-
	      vert relative encoding directories to  absolute  directories  by
	      prepending  the  current	directory.   The  positioning  of this
	      options is significant, as this option only  applies  to	subse-
	      quent 1m-e 22moptions.

       1m-x 4m22msuffix0m
	      Ignore fonts files of type 4msuffix24m.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       For each directory argument, 4mmkfontscale24m reads all of the scalable font
       files  in  the  directory.  For every font file found, an X11 font name
       (XLFD) is generated, and is written together with the file  name	 to  a
       file 1mfonts.scale 22min the directory.

       The  resulting 1mfonts.scale 22mfile should be checked and possibly manually
       edited before being used as input for the 1mmkfontdir22m(1) program.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-b	22mread bitmap fonts.  By default, bitmap fonts are ignored.

       1m-s	22mignore scalable fonts.  By default, scalable fonts are read.	 If
	      1m-b 22mis set, this flag has the side effect of enabling the reading
	      of 1mfonts.scale 22mfiles.  1m-o 4m22mfilename24m send program output to	4mfile-0m
	      4mname24m; default is 1mfonts.scale 22mif bitmap fonts are not being read,
	      and 1mfonts.dir 22mif they are.  If 4mfilename24m is relative, it is  cre-
	      ated  in	the  directory	being processed.  If it is the special
	      value 1m-22m, output is written to standard output.

       1m-x 4m22msuffix0m
	      exclude all files with the specified 4msuffix0m

       1m-a 4m22mencoding0m
	      add 4mencoding24m to the list of encodings searched for.

	      set the fraction of characters that  may	be  missing  in	 large
	      encodings to 4mfuzz24m percent.  Defaults to 2%.

       1m-l	22mWrite  1mfonts.dir  22mfiles suitable for implementations that cannot
	      reencode legacy fonts (BDF and PCF).  By default, it is  assumed

	      fonts.

       1m-e	22mspecifies a directory with encoding files.  Every such directory
	      is scanned for encoding files, the list of which is then written
	      to an "encodings.dir" file in every font directory.

       1m-p	22mSpecifies a prefix that is prepended to the encoding	 file  path
	      names  when  they	 are written to the "encodings.dir" file.  The
	      prefix is prepended litterally: if a `/' is required between the
	      prefix  and  the	path  names, it must be supplied explicitly as
	      part of the prefix.

       1m-r	22mKeep non-absolute encoding directories in  their  relative  form
	      when  writing  the "encodings.dir" file.	The default is to con-
	      vert relative encoding directories to  absolute  directories  by
	      prepending  the  current	directory.   The  positioning  of this
	      options is significant, as this option only  applies  to	subse-
	      quent

       1m-n	22mdo  not scan for fonts, do not write font directory files.  This
	      option is useful when generating encoding directories only.

1mNAME0m
       mkhtmlindex - generate index files for HTML man pages

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mmkhtmlindex 4m22mhtmlmandir0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mmkhtmlindex24m program generates index files for a directory of  HTML-
       formatted  manual  pages.  It searches for files whose names are of the
       form "name.1.html", and outputs index files  "manindex1.html",  "manin-
       dex.2.html",  and so on, one for each manual volume.  Empty index files
       will be removed.	 Names and descriptions	 are  found  by	 scanning  the
       first 4m<H2>24m section of each page.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mmkhtmlindex24m takes only one argument: the directory to process.

1mNOTES0m
       This  utility  is currently rather specific to XFree86.	In particular,
       the format of the index files it outputs is not	configurable,  nor  is
       the HTML formatting it expects of manual pages.

PROXYMNGR(1)							  PROXYMNGR(1)



1mNAME0m
       proxymngr - proxy manager service

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mproxymngr 22m[1m-config 4m22mfilename24m] [1m-timeout 4m22mseconds24m] [1m-retries 4m22m#24m] [1m-verbose22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  proxy  manager  (proxymngr)	 is responsible for resolving requests
       from xfindproxy (and other similar clients), starting new proxies  when
       appropriate,  and keeping track of all of the available proxy services.
       The proxy manager strives to reuse existing proxies whenever  possible.

       There  are two types of proxies that the proxy manager deals with, 4mman-0m
       4maged24m and 4munmanaged24m proxies.

       A 4mmanaged24m proxy is a proxy that is started ``on demand'' by	 the  proxy
       manager.

       An 4munmanaged24m proxy, on the other hand, is started either at system boot
       time, or manually by a system administrator.  The proxy manager is made
       aware  of its existence, but no attempt is made by the proxy manager to
       start unmanaged proxies.

       The command line options that can be specified to 1mproxymngr 22mare:


       1m-config 22mUsed to override the default proxymngr config file.	 See  below
	       for more details about the config file.


       1m-timeout0m
	       Sets  the  number of seconds between attempts made by the proxy
	       manager to find an unmanaged proxy.  The default is 10.


       1m-retries0m
	       Sets the maximum number of retries made by the proxy manager to
	       find an an unmanaged proxy.  The default is 3.


       1m-verbose0m
	       Causes various debugging and tracing records to be displayed as
	       requests are received and proxies are started.



1mProxy Manager Config File0m
       The proxy manager maintains a local configuration file  describing  the
       proxy  services	available.   This  configuration  file is installed in
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/proxymngr/pmconfig24m during the installation of  prox-
       ymngr.  The location of the configuration file can be overwritten using
       the 1m-config 22mcommand line option.

       Aside from lines starting with an exclamation point for comments,  each
       line of the configuration file describes either an unmanaged or managed
       proxy service.

       For unmanaged proxies, the format is:

	      <service-name> unmanaged <proxy-address>

       service-name is the name of the unmanaged proxy service, and  must  not
       contain	any spaces, for example ``XFWP''.  service-name is case insen-
       sitive.

       proxy-address is the network address of the unmanaged proxy.  The  for-
       mat  of	the address is specific to the service-name.  For example, for
       the   ``XFWP''	service,   the	 proxy-address	 might	 be    ``fire-
       wall.x.org:100''.

       If there is more than one entry in the config file with the same unman-
       aged service-name, the proxy manager will try to use the proxies in the
       order presented in the config file.

       For managed proxies, the format is:

	      <service-name> managed <command-to-start-proxy>

       service-name  is	 the  name  of the managed proxy service, and must not
       contain any spaces, for example ``LBX''.	 service-name is case insensi-
       tive.

       command-to-start-proxy  is the command executed by the proxy manager to
       start a new instance of the proxy.  If command-to-start-proxy  contains
       spaces, the complete command should be surrounded by single quotes.  If
       desired, command-to-start-proxy can be used  to	start  a  proxy	 on  a
       remote  machine.	  The specifics of the remote execution method used to
       do this is not specified here.


1mEXAMPLE0m
       Here is a sample configuration file:

	      ! proxy manager config file
	      !
	      ! Each line has the format:
	      !	   <serviceName> managed <startCommand>
	      !	       or
	      !	   <serviceName> unmanaged <proxyAddress>
	      !
	      lbx managed /usr/X11R6/bin/lbxproxy
	      !
	      ! substitute site-specific info
	      xfwp unmanaged firewall:4444


1mPROXY MANAGER DETAILS0m
       When the proxy manager gets a request from xfindproxy (or another simi-
       lar  client),  its  course of action will depend on the service-name in
       question.

       For a managed proxy service, the proxy manager will find out if any  of
       the  already running proxies for this service can handle a new request.
       If not, the proxy manager will attempt to start up a  new  instance  of
       the  proxy (using the command-to-start-proxy found in the config file).
       If that fails, an error will be returned to the caller.

       For an unmanaged proxy service, the proxy manager will look in the con-
       fig  file  to find all unmanaged proxies for this service.  If there is
       more than one entry in the config file with the same unmanaged service-
       name,  the  proxy manager will try to use the proxies in the order pre-
       sented in the config file.  If none of the unmanaged proxies  can  sat-
       isfy  the  request,  the	 proxy manager will timeout for a configurable
       amount of time (specified by 1m-timeout 22mor default of 10)  and  reattempt
       to  find an unmanaged proxy willing to satisfy the request.  The number
       of retries can be specified by the 1m-retries 22margument, or a default of 3
       will be used.  If the retries fail, the proxy manager has no choice but
       to return an error to the caller (since the proxy manager can not start
       unmanaged proxy services).


1mBUGS0m
       proxy manager listen port should be configurable.

       1m-timeout 22mand 1m-retries 22mis not implemented in proxymngr.

       proxymngr  does	not utilize the ``options'' and ``host'' fields in the
       proxy management protocol GetProxyAddr request.

PSWRAP(1)							     PSWRAP(1)



1mNAME0m
       pswrap - creates C procedures from segments of PostScript language code


1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mpswrap 22m[ 1m-apr 22m] [ 1m-o 4m22moutputCfile24m ] [ 1m-h 4m22moutputHfile24m ] [ 1m-s 4m22mmaxstring24m ]
       4minputfile0m


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mpswrap 22mreads input from 4minputfile24m and creates C-callable procedures,
       known as wraps, that send PostScript language code to the PostScript
       interpreter.  4minputfile24m contains segments of PostScript language code
       wrapped with a C-like procedure syntax.

       Wraps are the most efficient way for an application to communicate with
       the PostScript interpreter. For complete documentation of 1mpswrap 22mand
       the language it accepts, see "pswrap Reference Manual" in 4mProgramming0m
       4mthe24m 4mDisplay24m 4mPostScript24m 4mSystem24m 4mwith24m 4mX.0m



1mOPTIONS0m
       4minputfile0m
	      A file that contains one or more wrap definitions.  1mpswrap0m
	      transforms the definitions in 4minputfile24m into C procedures. If no
	      input file is specified, the standard input (which can be
	      redirected from a file or pipe) is used. The input file can
	      include text other than wrap definitions.	 1mpswrap 22mconverts wrap
	      definitions to C procedures and passes the other text through
	      unchanged. Therefore, it is possible to intersperse C-language
	      source code with wrap definitions in the input file.

	      4mNote:24m Although C code is allowed in a pswrap input file, it is
	      not allowed within a wrap body. In particular, no CPP macros
	      (for example, #define) are allowed inside a wrap.

       1m-a	22mGenerates ANSI C procedure prototypes for procedure definitions
	      in 4moutputCfile24m and, optionally, 4moutputHfile.24m  The 1m-a 22moption
	      allows compilers that recognize the ANSI C standard to do more
	      complete type checking of parameters. The 1m-a 22moption also causes
	      1mpswrap 22mto generate const declarations.

	      4mNote:24m ANSI C procedure prototype syntax is not recognized by
	      most non-ANSI C compilers, including many compilers based on the
	      Portable C Compiler. Use the 1m-a 22moption only in conjunction with
	      a compiler that conforms to the ANSI C Standard.

       1m-f 4m22mspecialHFile0m
	      Adds a #include to the generated source file for a special
	      header file.

       1m-h 4m22moutputHFile0m
	      Generates a header file that contains extern declarations for
	      non-static wraps. This file can be used in #include statements
	      in modules that use wraps. If the 1m-a 22moption is specified, the
	      declarations in the header file are ANSI C procedure prototypes.
	      If the 1m-h 22moption is omitted, a header file is not produced.

       1m-o 4m22moutputCFile0m
	      Specifies the file to which the generated wraps and passed-
	      through text are written. If omitted, the standard output is
	      used. If the 1m-a 22moption is also specified, the procedure
	      definitions generated by 1mpswrap 22mare in ANSI C procedure
	      prototype syntax.

       1m-p	22mSpecifies that strings passed by wraps are padded so that each
	      data object begins on a long-word (4-byte) boundary. This option
	      allows wraps to run on architectures that restrict data
	      alignment to 4-byte boundaries and improves performance on some
	      other architectures.

       1m-r	22mGenerates reentrant code for wraps shared by more than one
	      process (as in shared libraries). Reentrant code can be called
	      recursively or by more than one thread. The 1m-r 22moption causes
	      1mpswrap 22mto generate extra code, so use it only when necessary.

       1m-s 4m22mmaxstring0m
	      Sets the maximum allowable length of a PostScript string object
	      or hexadecimal string object in the wrap body input. A syntax
	      error is reported if a string is not terminated with ) or >
	      within 4mmaxstring24m characters.	 4mmaxstring24m cannot be set lower than
	      80; the default is 200.

RESIZE(1)							     RESIZE(1)



1mNAME0m
       resize - set TERMCAP and terminal settings to current xterm window size

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mresize 22m[ 1m-u 22m| 1m-c 22m] [ 1m-s 22m[ 4mrow24m 4mcol24m ] ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mResize24m prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP
       environment variables to indicate the current size of 4mxterm24m window from
       which the command is run.  For this output to take effect, 4mresize24m must
       either be evaluated as part of the command line (usually done with a
       shell alias or function) or else redirected to a file which can then be
       read in.	 From the C shell (usually known as 4m/bin/csh24m), the following
       alias could be defined in the user's 4m.cshrc24m:

	       %  alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

       After resizing the window, the user would type:

	       %  rs

       Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as 4m/bin/sh24m) that
       don't have command functions will need to send the output to a
       temporary file and the read it back in with the ``.'' command:

	       $  resize > /tmp/out
	       $  . /tmp/out

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options may be used with 4mresize24m:

       1m-u	 22mThis option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be
	       generated even if the user's current shell isn't 4m/bin/sh24m.

       1m-c	 22mThis option indicates that C shell commands should be generated
	       even if the user's current shell isn't 4m/bin/csh24m.

       1m-s 22m[4mrows24m 4mcolumns24m]
	       This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be
	       used instead of the VT100-style 4mxterm24m escape codes.	 If 4mrows0m
	       and 4mcolumns24m are given, 4mresize24m will ask the 4mxterm24m to resize
	       itself.	However, the window manager may choose to disallow the
	       change.

	       Note that the Sun console escape sequences are recognized by
	       XFree86 4mxterm24m and by 4mdtterm24m.  The 4mresize24m program may be
	       installed as 4msunsize24m, which causes makes it assume the 1m-s0m
	       option.

	       The 4mrows24m and 4mcolumns24m arguments must appear last; though they
	       are normally associated with the 1m-s 22moption, they are parsed
	       separately.

1mFILES0m

REVPATH(1)							    REVPATH(1)



1mNAME0m
       revpath - generate a relative path that can be used to undo a change-
       directory

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mrevpath 4m22mpath0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mrevpath24m program prints out a relative path that is the ``reverse''
       or ``inverse'' of 4mpath24m.  Start with two directories 4mtop24m and 4mbottom24m,
       with the latter below the former, and 4mpath24m is the location of 4mbottom0m
       relative to 4mtop24m.  The output of 4mrevpath24m is the location of 4mtop24m relative
       to 4mbottom24m.	The resulting path contains a trailing `/' character when
       the result is non-trivial.  If 4mpath24m is equivalent to `.', the resulting
       output is empty.	 If 4mpath24m is invalid in some way (e.g., doesn't
       represent the path to a subdirectory) the output is also empty and no
       error messages are ever generated.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       There are no diagnostics.  Error conditions are silently ignored, and
       the exit status is always 0.

1mBUGS0m
       It isn't possible to reverse arbitrary relative paths.  If any path
       element between the two end points of 4mpath24m is a symbolic link, the
       results will probably be incorrect.



RSTART(1)							     RSTART(1)



1mNAME0m
       rstart - a sample implementation of a Remote Start client

1mSYNOPSIS0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mRstart24m is a simple implementation of a Remote Start client as defined
       in "A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol Based on 1mrsh22m".  It uses 4mrsh24m as
       its underlying remote execution mechanism.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-c 4m22mcontext0m
	       This option specifies the 4mcontext24m in which the command is to be
	       run.  A 4mcontext24m specifies a general environment the program is
	       to be run in.  The details of this environment are host-
	       specific; the intent is that the client need not know how the
	       environment must be configured.	If omitted, the context
	       defaults to 1mX22m.  This should be suitable for running X programs
	       from the host's "usual" X installation.

       1m-g	 22mInterprets 4mcommand24m as a 4mgeneric24m 4mcommand24m, as discussed in the
	       protocol document.  This is intended to allow common
	       applications to be invoked without knowing what they are called
	       on the remote system.  Currently, the only generic commands
	       defined are 1mTerminal22m, 1mLoadMonitor22m, 1mListContexts22m, and
	       1mListGenericCommands22m.

       1m-l 4m22musername0m
	       This option is passed to the underlying 4mrsh24m; it requests that
	       the command be run as the specified user.

       1m-v	 22mThis option requests that 4mrstart24m be verbose in its operation.
	       Without this option, 4mrstart24m discards output from the remote's
	       4mrstart24m helper, and directs the 4mrstart24m helper to detach the
	       program from the 4mrsh24m connection used to start it.  With this
	       option, responses from the helper are displayed and the
	       resulting program is not detached from the connection.

1mNOTES0m
       This is a trivial implementation.  Far more sophisticated
       implementations are possible and should be developed.

       Error handling is nonexistent.  Without 1m-v22m, error reports from the
       remote are discarded silently.  With 1m-v22m, error reports are displayed.

       The $DISPLAY environment variable is passed.  If it starts with a
       colon, the local hostname is prepended.	The local domain name should
       be appended to unqualified host names, but isn't.

       The $SESSION_MANAGER environment variable should be passed, but isn't.

       X11 authority information is passed for the current display.

       ICE authority information should be passed, but isn't.  It isn't
       completely clear how 4mrstart24m should select what ICE authority
       information to pass.

       Even without 1m-v22m, the sample 4mrstart24m helper will leave a shell waiting
       for the program to complete.  This causes no real harm and consumes
       relatively few resources, but if it is undesirable it can be avoided by
       explicitly specifying the "exec" command to the shell, eg

	    rstart somehost exec xterm

       This is obviously dependent on the command interpreter being used on
       the remote system; the example given will work for the Bourne and C
       shells.

1mNAME0m
       rstartd - a sample implementation of a Remote Start rsh helper

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mrstartd0m

       1mrstartd.real 22m[-c 4mconfigfilename24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mRstartd24m is an implementation of a Remote Start "helper" as defined in
       "A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol Based on 1mrsh22m".

       This document describes the peculiarities of 4mrstartd24m and how it is
       configured.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-c 4m22mconfigfilename0m
	       This option specifies the "global" configuration file that
	       4mrstartd24m is to read.	 Normally, 4mrstartd24m is a shell script that
	       invokes 4mrstartd.real24m with the 1m-c 22mswitch, allowing local
	       configuration of the location of the configuration file.	 If
	       4mrstartd.real24m is started without the -c option, it reads
	       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rstart/config24m.

1mINSTALLATION0m
       It is critical to successful interoperation of the Remote Start
       protocol that 4mrstartd24m be installed in a directory which is in the
       "default" search path, so that default rsh requests and the ilk will be
       able to find it.

1mCONFIGURATION AND OPERATION0m
       4mRstartd24m is by design highly configurable.  One would like things like
       configuration file locations to be fixed, so that users and
       administrators can find them without searching, but reality is that no
       two vendors will agree on where things should go, and nobody thinks the
       original location is "right".  Thus, 4mrstartd24m allows one to relocate 1mall0m
       of its files and directories.

       4mRstartd24m has a hierarchy of configuration files which are executed in
       order when a request is made.  They are:

	    global config
	    per-user ("local") config
	    global per-context config
	    per-user ("local") per-context config
	    config from request

       As you might guess from the presence of "config from request", all of
       the config files are in the format of an 4mrstart24m request.  4mRstartd0m
       defines a few additional keywords with the INTERNAL- prefix for
       specifying its configuration.

       4mRstartd24m starts by reading and executing the global config file.  This
       file will normally specify the locations of the other configuration
       files and any systemwide defaults.

       4mRstartd24m will then read the user's local config file, default name
       $HOME/.rstart.

       4mRstartd24m will then start interpreting the request.

       Presumably one of the first lines in the request will be a CONTEXT
       line.  The context name is converted to lower case.

       4mRstartd24m will read the global config file for that context, default name
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rstart/contexts/<name>, if any.

       It will then read the user's config file for that context, default name
       $HOME/.rstart.contexts/<name>, if any.

       (If neither of these exists, 4mrstartd24m aborts with a Failure message.)

       4mRstartd24m will finish interpreting the request, and execute the program
       specified.

       This allows the system administrator and the user a large degree of
       control over the operation of 4mrstartd24m.  The administrator has final
       say, because the global config file doesn't need to specify a per-user
       config file.  If it does, however, the user can override anything from
       the global file, and can even completely replace the global context
       config files.

       The config files have a somewhat more flexible format than requests do;
       they are allowed to contain blank lines and lines beginning with "#"
       are comments and ignored.  (#s in the middle of lines are data, not
       comment markers.)

       Any commands run are provided a few useful pieces of information in
       environment variables.  The exact names are configurable, but the
       supplied defaults are:

	    $RSTART_CONTEXT	     the name of the context
	    $RSTART_GLOBAL_CONTEXTS  the global contexts directory
	    $RSTART_LOCAL_CONTEXTS   the local contexts directory
	    $RSTART_GLOBAL_COMMANDS  the global generic commands directory
	    $RSTART_LOCAL_COMMANDS   the local generic commands directory

       $RSTART_{GLOBAL,LOCAL}_CONTEXTS should contain one special file, @List,
       which contains a list of the contexts in that directory in the format
       specified for ListContexts.  The supplied version of ListContexts will
       cat both the global and local copies of @List.

       Generic commands are searched for in several places: (defaults)

	    per-user per-context directory ($HOME/.rstart.commands/<context>)
	    global per-context directory (/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rstart/commands/<context>)
	    per-user all-contexts directory ($HOME/.rstart.commands)
	    global all-contexts directory (/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rstart/commands)

       (Yes, this means you can't have an all-contexts generic command with
       the same name as a context.  It didn't seem like a big deal.)

       Each of these directories should have a file called @List that gives
       the names and descriptions of the commands in that directory in the
       format specified for ListGenericCommands.

1mCONFIGURATION KEYWORDS0m
       There are several "special" 4mrstart24m keywords defined for 4mrstartd0m
       configuration.  Unless otherwise specified, there are no defaults;
       related features are disabled in this case.


       1mINTERNAL-REGISTRIES name ...0m
	       Gives a space-separated list of "MISC" registries that this
	       system understands.  (Registries other than this are accepted
	       but generate a Warning.)

       1mINTERNAL-LOCAL-DEFAULT relative_filename0m
	       Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user config file.

       1mINTERNAL-GLOBAL-CONTEXTS absolute_directory_name0m
	       Gives the name of the system-wide contexts directory.

       1mINTERNAL-LOCAL-CONTEXTS relative_directory_name0m
	       Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user contexts
	       directory.

       1mINTERNAL-GLOBAL-COMMANDS absolute_directory_name0m
	       Gives the name of the system-wide generic commands directory.

       1mINTERNAL-LOCAL-COMMANDS relative_directory_name0m
	       Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user generic
	       commands directory.

       1mINTERNAL-VARIABLE-PREFIX prefix0m
	       Gives the prefix for the configuration environment variables
	       4mrstartd24m passes to its kids.

       1mINTERNAL-AUTH-PROGRAM authscheme program argv[0] argv[1] ...0m
	       Specifies the program to run to set up authentication for the
	       specified authentication scheme.	 "program argv[0] ..." gives
	       the program to run and its arguments, in the same form as the
	       EXEC keyword.

       1mINTERNAL-AUTH-INPUT authscheme0m
	       Specifies the data to be given to the authorization program as
	       its standard input.  Each argument is passed as a single line.
	       $n, where n is a number, is replaced by the n'th argument to
	       the "AUTH authscheme arg1 arg2 ..." line.

       1mINTERNAL-PRINT arbitrary text0m
	       Prints its arguments as a Debug message.	 Mostly for 4mrstartd0m
	       debugging, but could be used to debug config files.

1mNOTES0m
       When using the C shell, or any other shell which runs a script every
       time the shell is started, the script may get run several times.	 In
       the worst case, the script may get run 1mthree 22mtimes:

	    By rsh, to run 4mrstartd0m
	    By 4mrstartd24m, to run the specified command
	    By the command, eg 4mxterm0m

       4mrstartd24m currently limits lines, both from config files and requests, to
       BUFSIZ bytes.

       DETACH is implemented by redirecting file descriptors 0,1, and 2 to
       /dev/null and forking before executing the program.

       CMD is implemented by invoking $SHELL (default /bin/sh) with "-c" and
       the specified command as arguments.

       POSIX-UMASK is implemented in the obvious way.

       The authorization programs are run in the same context as the target
       program - same environment variables, path, etc.	 Long term this might
       be a problem.

       In the X context, GENERIC-CMD Terminal runs xterm.  In the OpenWindows
       context, GENERIC-CMD Terminal runs cmdtool.

       In the X context, GENERIC-CMD LoadMonitor runs xload.  In the
       OpenWindows context, GENERIC-CMD LoadMonitor runs perfmeter.

       1mGENERIC-CMD ListContexts 22mlists the contents of @List in both the
       system-wide and per-user contexts directories.  It is available in all
       contexts.

       1mGENERIC-CMD ListGenericCommands 22mlists the contents of @List in the
       system-wide and per-user commands directories, including the per-
       context subdirectories for the current context.	It is available in all
       contexts.

       1mCONTEXT None 22mis not implemented.

       1mCONTEXT Default 22mis really dull.

       For installation ease, the "contexts" directory in the distribution
       contains a file "@Aliases" which lists a context name and aliases for
       that context.  This file is used to make symlinks in the contexts and
       commands directories.

       All 1mMISC 22mvalues are passed unmodified as environment variables.

       One can mistreat 4mrstartd24m in any number of ways, resulting in anything
       from stupid behavior to core dumps.  Other than by explicitly running
       programs I don't think it can write or delete any files, but there's no
       guarantee of that.  The important thing is that (a) it probably won't
       do anything REALLY stupid and (b) it runs with the user's permissions,
       so it can't do anything catastrophic.

       @List files need not be complete; contexts or commands which are dull
       or which need not or should not be advertised need not be listed.  In
       particular, per-user @List files should not list things which are in
       the system-wide @List files.  In the future, perhaps ListContexts and
       ListGenericCommands will automatically suppress lines from the system-
       wide files when there are per-user replacements for those lines.

       Error handling is OK to weak.  In particular, no attempt is made to
       properly report errors on the exec itself.  (Perversely, exec errors
       could be reliably reported when detaching, but not when passing the
       stdin/out socket to the app.)

       If compiled with -DODT1_DISPLAY_HACK, 4mrstartd24m will work around a bug in
       SCO ODT version 1.  (1.1?)  (The bug is that the X clients are all
       compiled with a bad library that doesn't know how to look host names up
       using DNS.  The fix is to look up a host name in $DISPLAY and
       substitute an IP address.)  This is a trivial example of an
       incompatibility that 4mrstart24m can hide.

SESSREG(1)							    SESSREG(1)



1mNAME0m
       sessreg - manage utmp/wtmp entries for non-init clients

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1msessreg 22m[-w 4mwtmp-file24m] [-u 4mutmp-file24m] [-l 4mline-name24m] [-h 4mhost-name24m] [-s
       4mslot-number24m] [-x 4mXservers-file24m] [-t 4mttys-file24m] [-a] [-d] 4muser-name0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mSessreg24m is a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries for xdm
       sessions.

       System V has a better interface to /etc/utmp than BSD; it dynamically
       allocates entries in the file, instead of writing them at fixed
       positions indexed by position in /etc/ttys.

       To manage BSD-style utmp files, 4msessreg24m has two strategies.	 In
       conjunction with xdm, the -x option counts the number of lines in
       /etc/ttys and then adds to that the number of the line in the Xservers
       file which specifies the display.  The display name must be specified
       as the "line-name" using the -l option.	This sum is used as the "slot-
       number" in /etc/utmp that this entry will be written at.	 In the more
       general case, the -s option specifies the slot-number directly.	If for
       some strange reason your system uses a file other that /etc/ttys to
       manage init, the -t option can direct 4msessreg24m to look elsewhere for a
       count of terminal sessions.

       Conversely, System V managers will not ever need to use these options
       (-x, -s and -t).	 To make the program easier to document and explain,
       4msessreg24m accepts the BSD-specific flags in the System V environment and
       ignores them.

       BSD and Linux also have a host-name field in the utmp file which
       doesn't exist in System V.  This option is also ignored by the System V
       version of 4msessreg24m.

1mUSAGE0m
       In Xstartup, place a call like:

	      sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $USER

       and in Xreset:

	      sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $USER

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-w 4m22mwtmp-file0m
	      This specifies an alternate wtmp file, instead of /usr/adm/wtmp
	      for BSD or /etc/wtmp for sysV.  The special name "none" disables
	      writing records to /usr/adm/wtmp.

       1m-u 4m22mutmp-file0m
	      This specifies an alternate utmp file, instead of "/etc/utmp".
	      The special name "none" disables writing records to /etc/utmp.

       1m-l 4m22mline-name0m
	      This describes the "line" name of the entry.  For terminal
	      sessions, this is the final pathname segment of the terminal
	      device filename (e.g. ttyd0).  For X sessions, it should
	      probably be the local display name given to the users session
	      (e.g. :0).  If none is specified, the terminal name will be
	      determined with ttyname(3) and stripped of leading components.

       1m-h 4m22mhost-name0m
	      This is set for BSD hosts to indicate that the session was
	      initiated from a remote host.  In typical xdm usage, this
	      options is not used.

       1m-s 4m22mslot-number0m
	      Each potential session has a unique slot number in BSD systems,
	      most are identified by the position of the 4mline-name24m in the
	      /etc/ttys file.  This option overrides the default position
	      determined with ttyslot(3).  This option is inappropriate for
	      use with xdm, the -x option is more useful.

       1m-x 4m22mXservers-file0m
	      As X sessions are one-per-display, and each display is entered
	      in this file, this options sets the 4mslot-number24m to be the number
	      of lines in the 4mttys-file24m plus the index into this file that the
	      4mline-name24m is found.

       1m-t 4m22mttys-file0m
	      This specifies an alternate file which the 4m-x24m option will use to
	      count the number of terminal sessions on a host.

       1m-a	22mThis session should be added to utmp/wtmp.

       1m-d	22mThis session should be deleted from utmp/wtmp.  One of -a/-d
	      must be specified.

	       layout may be specified on the command line.

       1m-model 4m22mname0m
	       Specifies the name of the keyboard model used to determine the
	       components which make up the keyboard description.  Only one
	       model may be specified on the command line.

       1m-option 4m22mname0m
	       Specifies the name of an option to determine the components
	       which make up the keyboard description;	multiple options may

	       to determine the components which make up the keyboard
	       description.  Only one variant may be specified on the command
	       line.

1mUSING WITH xkbcomp0m
       If you have an Xserver and a client shell running on different
       computers and XKB configuration files sets on those machines are
       different you can get problems specifying a keyboard map by model,
       layout, options names.  The thing is the 1msetxkbcomp 22mconverts these
       names to names of XKB configuration files according to files that are
       on the client side computer.  Then it sends the file names to the
       server where the 1mxkbcomp 22mhas to compose a complete keyboard map using
       files which the server has.  Thus if the sets of files differ
       significantly the names that the 1msetxkbmap 22mgenerates can be
       unacceptable on the server side.	 You can solve this problem running
       the 1mxkbcomp 22mon the client side too.	 With the 4m-print24m option 1msetxkbmap0m
       just prints the files names in an appropriate format to its stdout and
       this output can be piped directly to the 1mxkbcomp 22minput. For example, a
       command

       1msetxkbmap us -print | xkbcomp - $DISPLAY0m

       makes both step on the same (client) machine and loads a keyboard map
       into the server.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1msmproxy 22m[-clientId id] [-restore saveFile]

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-clientId 4m22mid0m
	       Specifies the session ID used by 4msmproxy24m in the previous
	       session.

       1m-restore 4m22msaveFile0m
	       Specifies the file used by 4msmproxy24m to save state in the
	       previous session.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4msmproxy24m allows X applications that do not support X11R6 session
       management to participate in an X11R6 session.

       In order for 4msmproxy24m to act as a proxy for an X application, one of the
       following must be true:

       - The application maps a top level window containing the
       1mWM_CLIENT_LEADER 22mproperty.	This property provides a pointer to the
       client leader window which contains the 1mWM_CLASS22m, 1mWM_NAME22m, 1mWM_COMMAND22m,
       and 1mWM_CLIENT_MACHINE 22mproperties.

       or ...

       - The application maps a top level window which does not contain the
       1mWM_CLIENT_LEADER 22mproperty.	However, this top level window contains the
       1mWM_CLASS22m, 1mWM_NAME22m, 1mWM_COMMAND22m, and 1mWM_CLIENT_MACHINE 22mproperties.

       An application that support the 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mprotocol will receive
       a 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mclient message each time the session manager issues
       a checkpoint or shutdown.  This allows the application to save state.
       If an application does not support the 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mprotocol, then
       the proxy will provide enough information to the session manager to
       restart the application (using 1mWM_COMMAND22m), but no state will be
       restored.

STARTX(1)							     STARTX(1)



1mNAME0m
       startx - initialize an X session

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mstartx 22m[ [ 4mclient24m ] 4moptions24m ... ] [ 1m-- 22m[ 4mserver24m ] 4moptions24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mstartx24m script is a front end to 4mxinit24m that provides a somewhat
       nicer user interface for running a single session of the X Window
       System.	It is often run with no arguments.

       Arguments immediately following the 4mstartx24m command are used to start a
       client in the same manner as 4mxinit24m(1).  The special argument '--' marks
       the end of client arguments and the beginning of server options.	 It
       may be convenient to specify server options with startx to change on a
       per-session basis the default color depth, the server's notion of the
       number of dots-per-inch the display device presents, or take advantage
       of a different server layout, as permitted by the 4mXFree8624m(1) server and
       specified in the 4mXF86Config24m(5) file.  Some examples of specifying
       server arguments follow; consult the manual page for your X server to
       determine which arguments are legal.

	      startx -- -depth 16

	      startx -- -dpi 100

	      startx -- -layout Multihead

       To determine the client to run, 4mstartx24m first looks for a file called
       4m.xinitrc24m in the user's home directory.  If that is not found, it uses
       the file 4mxinitrc24m in the 4mxinit24m library directory.  If command line
       client options are given, they override this behavior and revert to the
       4mxinit24m(1) behavior.	To determine the server to run, 4mstartx24m first looks
       for a file called 4m.xserverrc24m in the user's home directory.	If that is
       not found, it uses the file 4mxserverrc24m in the 4mxinit24m library directory.
       If command line server options are given, they override this behavior
       and revert to the 4mxinit24m(1) behavior.  Users rarely need to provide a
       4m.xserverrc24m file.  See the 4mxinit24m(1) manual page for more details on the
       arguments.

       The system-wide 4mxinitrc24m and 4mxserverrc24m files are found in the
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit24m directory.

       The 4m.xinitrc24m is typically a shell script which starts many clients
       according to the user's preference.  When this shell script exits,
       4mstartx24m kills the server and performs any other session shutdown needed.
       Most of the clients started by 4m.xinitrc24m should be run in the
       background.  The last client should run in the foreground; when it
       exits, the session will exit.  People often choose a session manager,
       window manager, or 4mxterm24m as the ''magic'' client.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       Below is a sample 4m.xinitrc24m that starts several applications and leaves
       the window manager running as the ''last'' application.	Assuming that
       the window manager has been configured properly, the user then chooses
       the ''Exit'' menu item to shut down X.

	   xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources
	   xsetroot -solid gray &
	   xbiff -geometry -430+5 &
	   oclock -geometry 75x75-0-0 &
	   xload -geometry -80-0 &
	   xterm -geometry +0+60 -ls &
	   xterm -geometry +0-100 &
	   xconsole -geometry -0+0 -fn 5x7 &
	   exec twm

1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES0m
       DISPLAY			This variable gets set to the name of the
				display to which clients should connect.  Note
				that this gets 4mset24m, not read.

       XAUTHORITY		This variable, if not already defined, gets
				set to 4m$(HOME)/.Xauthority24m.  This is to
				prevent the X server, if not given the 4m-auth0m
				argument, from automatically setting up
				insecure host-based authentication for the
				local host.  See the 4mXserver24m(1) and
				4mXsecurity24m(7) manual pages for more information
				on X client/server authentication.

1mFILES0m
       4m$(HOME)/.xinitrc24m	     Client to run.  Typically a shell script which
				runs many programs in the background.

       4m$(HOME)/.xserverrc24m	     Server to run.  The default is 4mX24m.

       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc0m
				Client to run if the user has no 4m.xinitrc0m
				file.

       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xserverrc0m
				Server to run if the user has no 4m.xserverrc0m

1mKNOWN BUGS0m
       Some  window  managers may not accept a pixmap which is not a bitmap as
       icon because this does not respect ICCCM, many of the well  known  ones
       will accept it though.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This  program  is  designed  to	provide	 a  means for testing Netscape
       Navigator UNIX plug-ins. It exercises the plug-in in  a	way  close  (I
       hope)  to how Navigator does, and because it is a standalone program it
       allows you to run it  through  debugger	and  to	 use  various  program
       analysis tools.

       The  line-mode  browser	1mwww22m,  must	 be  in your 1mPATH 22mto be able to use
       testplugin successfully.

1mARGUMENTS0m
       1msrc=4m22murl24m This argument specifies the source document to use.  It  should
	       be  of  the  MIME  type	your plug-in is expecting since unlike
	       within Netscape, no type checking is done and the  document  is
	       simply streamed to the plug-in.


       1m[width=4m22mwidth24m1m] [height=4m22mheight24m1m]0m
	       These options allow to specify the plug-in window size.


       1m[4m22mname24m1m=4m22mvalue24m1m]...0m
	       In  addition  to	 the  arguments	 described  above,  any	 other
	       argument can be specified and will be passed  uninterpreted  to
	       the plug-in (through the NPP_New method).

1mCURRENT LIMITATIONS0m
       I've  not  implemented all of the "Netscape Methods", but only the ones
       I've needed so far. Also the "Plug-in Methods" are not called in	 every
       possible manner so it does not provide a 100% testing coverage.

TWM(1)									TWM(1)



1mNAME0m
       twm - Tab Window Manager for the X Window System

1mSYNTAX0m
       1mtwm 22m[ 1m-display 4m22mdpy24m ] [ 1m-s 22m] [ 1m-f 4m22minitfile24m ] [ 1m-v 22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mTwm24m is  a  window  manager	for  the  X  Window  System.   It  provides
       titlebars,  shaped  windows,  several  forms  of icon management, user-
       defined macro  functions,  click-to-type	 and  pointer-driven  keyboard
       focus, and user-specified key and pointer button bindings.

       This  program  is  usually  started  by	the  user's session manager or
       startup script.	When used from 4mxdm(1)24m or 4mxinit(1)24m  without  a	 session
       manager,	 4mtwm24m  is  frequently  executed  in	 the foreground as the last
       client.	When run this way,  exiting  4mtwm24m  causes  the  session  to	 be
       terminated (i.e., logged out).

       By  default,  application  windows are surrounded by a ``frame'' with a
       titlebar at the top and	a  special  border  around  the	 window.   The
       titlebar	 contains  the window's name, a rectangle that is lit when the
       window is  receiving  keyboard  input,  and  function  boxes  known  as
       ``titlebuttons'' at the left and right edges of the titlebar.

       Pressing	 pointer  Button1  (usually the left-most button unless it has
       been changed with 4mxmodmap24m) on a titlebutton will  invoke  the  function
       associated  with	 the  button.	In  the default interface, windows are
       iconified by clicking (pressing and  then  immediately  releasing)  the
       left  titlebutton  (which  looks	 like a Dot).  Conversely, windows are
       deiconified by clicking in the associated icon or  entry	 in  the  icon
       manager	(see  description  of  the variable 1mShowIconManager 22mand of the
       function 1mf.showiconmgr22m).

       Windows are resized by pressing the right titlebutton (which  resembles
       a  group	 of nested squares), dragging the pointer over edge that is to
       be moved, and releasing the pointer when the outline of the  window  is
       the  desired  size.   Similarly,	 windows  are moved by pressing in the
       title or highlight  region,  dragging  a	 window	 outline  to  the  new
       location,  and  then  releasing	when  the  outline  is	in the desired
       position.  Just clicking in the title or highlight  region  raises  the
       window without moving it.

       When  new  windows  are	created,  4mtwm24m will honor any size and location
       information requested by the user (usually  through  4m-geometry24m  command
       line   argument	 or   resources	  for  the  individual	applications).
       Otherwise, an outline of the window's default size, its	titlebar,  and
       lines  dividing	the  window into a 3x3 grid that track the pointer are
       displayed.  Clicking pointer Button1 will position the  window  at  the
       current	position  and  give  it	 the  default  size.  Pressing pointer
       Button2 (usually the middle pointer button) and	dragging  the  outline
       will  give  the	window	its current position but allow the sides to be
       resized as described above.   Clicking  pointer	Button3	 (usually  the
       right  pointer  button)	will  give the window its current position but
       attempt to make it long enough to touch the bottom the screen.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mTwm24m accepts the following command line options:


       1m-display 4m22mdpy0m
	       This option specifies the X server to use.

       1m-s	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  only	 the  default  screen	(as
	       specified  by  1m-display 22mor by the 1mDISPLAY 22menvironment variable)
	       should be managed.  By default, 4mtwm24m will attempt to manage	all
	       screens on the display.

       1m-f 4m22mfilename0m
	       This  option specifies the name of the startup file to use.  By
	       default, 4mtwm24m will look in the user's home directory	 for  files
	       named 4m.twmrc.num24m (where 4mnum24m is a screen number) or 4m.twmrc24m.

       1m-v	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mtwm24m  should print error messages
	       whenever an unexpected X Error event is received.  This can  be
	       useful  when  debugging	applications but can be distracting in
	       regular use.

1mCUSTOMIZATION0m
       Much of 4mtwm24m's appearance and behavior can be controlled by providing  a
       startup	file  in one of the following locations (searched in order for
       each screen being managed when 4mtwm24m begins):

       1m$HOME/.twmrc.4m22mscreennumber0m
	       The 4mscreennumber24m is a small positive number (e.g. 0,  1,  etc.)
	       representing  the  screen  number  (e.g. the last number in the
	       DISPLAY environment  variable  4mhost:displaynum.screennum24m)  that
	       would  be  used to contact that screen of the display.  This is
	       intended for displays with multiple screens of differing visual
	       types.

       1m$HOME/.twmrc0m
	       This is the usual name for an individual user's startup file.

       1m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/twm/system.twmrc0m
	       If  neither  of the preceding files are found, 4mtwm24m will look in
	       this file for a default configuration.  This is often  tailored
	       by  the	site  administrator  to	 provide  convenient  menus or
	       familiar bindings for novice users.

       If no startup files are found,  4mtwm24m	 will  use  the	 built-in  defaults
       described above.	 The only resource used by 4mtwm24m is 4mbitmapFilePath24m for a
       colon-separated list of directories to search when looking  for	bitmap
       files  (for  more  information,	see  the  4mAthena24m  4mWidgets24m  manual  and
       4mxrdb(1)24m).

       4mTwm24m	 startup  files	 are  logically	 broken	 up  into  three  types	 of
       specifications:	 4mVariables24m,  4mBindings24m,  4mMenus24m.	The 4mVariables24m section
       must come first and is used to describe	the  fonts,  colors,  cursors,
       border  widths,	icon  and window placement, highlighting, autoraising,
       layout of titles, warping, use  of  the	icon  manager.	 The  4mBindings0m
       section	usually comes second and is used to specify the functions that
       should be to be invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons  are  pressed
       in  windows,  icons,  titles,  and frames.  The 4mMenus24m section gives any
       user-defined menus (containing functions to be invoked or  commands  to
       be executed).

       Variable	 names	and  keywords  are  case-insensitive.  Strings must be
       surrounded by double quote  characters  (e.g.  "blue")  and  are	 case-
       sensitive.   A  pound sign (#) outside of a string causes the remainder
       of the line in which the character appears to be treated as a  comment.

1mVARIABLES0m
       Many of the aspects of 4mtwm24m's user interface are controlled by variables
       that may be set in the user's startup file.  Some of  the  options  are
       enabled	or  disabled  simply  by the presence of a particular keyword.
       Other options require keywords, numbers, strings, or lists  of  all  of
       these.

       Lists  are surrounded by braces and are usually separated by whitespace
       or a newline.  For example:

	    1mAutoRaise 22m{ "emacs" "XTerm" "Xmh" }

       or

	    1mAutoRaise0m
	    {
		 "emacs"
		 "XTerm"
		 "Xmh"
	    }

       When a variable containing a list of strings  representing  windows  is
       searched (e.g. to determine whether or not to enable autoraise as shown
       above), a string must be an exact, case-sensitive match to the window's
       name  (given  by	 the  WM_NAME window property), resource name or class
       name (both given by  the	 WM_CLASS  window  property).	The  preceding
       example	would  enable  autoraise on windows named ``emacs'' as well as
       any 4mxterm24m (since they are of class ``XTerm'') or xmh windows (which are
       of class ``Xmh'').

       String  arguments  that	are interpreted as filenames (see the 1mPixmaps22m,
       1mCursors22m, and 1mIconDirectory 22mbelow) will	 prepend  the  user's  directory
       (specified  by the 1mHOME 22menvironment variable) if the first character is
       a tilde (~).  If, instead, the first character is a colon (:), the name
       is  assumed  to	refer  to one of the internal bitmaps that are used to
       create the default titlebars symbols:  1m:xlogo 22mor 1m:delete 22m(both refer to
       the  X  logo),  1m:dot  22mor 1m:iconify 22m(both refer to the dot), 1m:resize 22m(the
       nested squares used by the resize button), 1m:menu 22m(a page  with  lines),
       and 1m:question 22m(the question mark used for non-existent bitmap files).

       The  following  variables  may be specified at the top of a 4mtwm24m startup
       file.  Lists of Window name prefix strings are indicated	 by  4mwin-list24m.
       Optional arguments are shown in square brackets:

       1mAutoRaise 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This   variable	 specifies  a  list  of	 windows  that	should
	       automatically be raised whenever the pointer enters the window.
	       This  action  can  be  interactively  enabled  or  disabled  on
	       individual windows using the function 1mf.autoraise22m.

       1mAutoRelativeResize0m
	       This variable indicates that dragging out a window size (either
	       when  initially	sizing the window with pointer Button2 or when
	       resizing it) should not wait until the pointer has crossed  the
	       window edges.  Instead, moving the pointer automatically causes
	       the nearest edge or edges to move by  the  same	amount.	  This
	       allows  the resizing of windows that extend off the edge of the
	       screen.	If the pointer is in the center of the window,	or  if
	       the  resize  is begun by pressing a titlebutton, 4mtwm24m will still
	       wait for the  pointer  to  cross	 a  window  edge  (to  prevent
	       accidents).   This option is particularly useful for people who
	       like the	 press-drag-release  method  of	 sweeping  out	window
	       sizes.

       1mBorderColor 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwincolorlist24m }]
	       This  variable  specifies the default color of the border to be
	       placed around all non-iconified windows, and may only be	 given
	       within  a  1mColor22m,  1mGrayscale  22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	 The optional
	       4mwincolorlist24m specifies a list of window and	 color	name  pairs
	       for  specifying particular border colors for different types of
	       windows.	 For example:

		    1mBorderColor 22m"gray50"
		    {
			 "XTerm"   "red"
			 "xmh"	   "green"
		    }

	       The default is "black".

       1mBorderTileBackground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwincolorlist24m }]
	       This variable specifies the default  background	color  in  the
	       gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if 1mNoHighlight0m
	       hasn't been set),  and  may  only  be  given  within  a	1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	The optional 4mwincolorlist24m allows
	       per-window colors to be specified.  The default	is "white".

       1mBorderTileForeground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwincolorlist24m }]
	       This variable specifies the default  foreground	color  in  the
	       gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if 1mNoHighlight0m
	       hasn't been set),  and  may  only  be  given  within  a	1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	The optional 4mwincolorlist24m allows
	       per-window colors to be specified.  The default is "black".

       1mBorderWidth 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding  all	 client window frames if 1mClientBorderWidth 22mhas
	       not been specified.  This value is also used to set the	border
	       size of windows created by 4mtwm24m (such as the icon manager).	The
	       default is 2.

       1mButtonIndent 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the amount by which titlebuttons should
	       be indented on all sides.  Positive values cause the buttons to
	       be smaller than the window text and highlight area so that they
	       stand   out.    Setting	this  and  the	1mTitleButtonBorderWidth0m
	       variables to 0 makes  titlebuttons  be  as  tall	 and  wide  as
	       possible.  The default is 1.

       1mClientBorderWidth0m
	       This  variable  indicates that border width of a window's frame
	       should be set to the initial border width of the window, rather
	       than to the value of 1mBorderWidth22m.

       1mColor 22m{ 4mcolors-list24m }
	       This  variable specifies a list of color assignments to be made
	       if the default display  is  capable  of	displaying  more  than
	       simple  black  and  white.   The	 4mcolors-list24m is made up of the
	       following color variables and their values:  1mDefaultBackground22m,
	       1mDefaultForeground22m,	      1mMenuBackground22m,	 1mMenuForeground22m,
	       1mMenuTitleBackground22m,   1mMenuTitleForeground22m,	1mMenuShadowColor22m,
	       1mMenuBorderColor22m, 1mPointerForeground22m, and 1mPointerBackground22m.  The
	       following color variables may also be given a  list  of	window
	       and color name pairs to allow per-window colors to be specified
	       (see	 1mBorderColor	    22mfor	details):      1mBorderColor22m,
	       1mIconManagerHighlight22m,		     1mBorderTitleBackground22m,
	       1mBorderTitleForeground22m,    1mTitleBackground22m,	1mTitleForeground22m,
	       1mIconBackground22m,	    1mIconForeground22m,	1mIconBorderColor22m,
	       1mIconManagerBackground22m, and 1mIconManagerForeground22m.  For example:

		    1mColor0m
		    {
			 MenuBackground	     "gray50"
			 MenuForeground	     "blue"
			 BorderColor		  "red" { "XTerm" "yellow" }
			 TitleForeground	  "yellow"
			 TitleBackground	  "blue"
		    }

	       All  of	these  color  variables	 may also be specified for the
	       1mMonochrome 22mvariable, allowing the same initialization  file	 to
	       be used on both color and monochrome displays.

       1mConstrainedMoveTime 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  length  of  time between button
	       clicks needed to begin a constrained  move  operation.	Double
	       clicking	 within	 this amount of time when invoking 1mf.move 22mwill
	       cause the window to be moved only in a horizontal  or  vertical
	       direction.   Setting  this  value to 0 will disable constrained
	       moves.  The default is 400 milliseconds.

       1mCursors 22m{ 4mcursor-list24m }
	       This variable specifies the glyphs  that	 4mtwm24m  should  use	for
	       various	pointer	 cursors.   Each  cursor may be defined either
	       from the 1mcursor 22mfont or from two bitmap files.  Shapes from the
	       1mcursor 22mfont may be specified directly as:

			 4mcursorname24m     "4mstring24m"

	       where  4mcursorname24m  is one of the cursor names listed below, and
	       4mstring24m  is	the  name  of  a  glyph	 as  found  in	 the   file
	       4m/usr/X11R6/include/X11/cursorfont.h24m	   (without   the   ``XC_''
	       prefix).	 If the cursor is to be defined from bitmap files, the
	       following syntax is used instead:

			 4mcursorname24m     "4mimage24m"   "4mmask24m"

	       The   4mimage24m	 and  4mmask24m	 strings  specify  the	names  of  files
	       containing the glyph image and mask  in	4mbitmap(1)24m	form.	The
	       bitmap  files  are  located  in	the same manner as icon bitmap
	       files.	The  following	example	 shows	the   default	cursor
	       definitions:

		    1mCursors0m
		    {
			 Frame		"top_left_arrow"
			 Title		"top_left_arrow"
			 Icon	   "top_left_arrow"
			 IconMgr   "top_left_arrow"
			 Move	   "fleur"
			 Resize		"fleur"
			 Menu	   "sb_left_arrow"
			 Button		"hand2"
			 Wait	   "watch"
			 Select		"dot"
			 Destroy   "pirate"
		    }


       1mDecorateTransients0m
	       This   variable	 indicates   that   transient  windows	(those
	       containing a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property) should have  titlebars.
	       By default, transients are not reparented.

       1mDefaultBackground 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  background color to be used for
	       sizing and information windows.	The default is "white".

       1mDefaultForeground 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the foreground color  to	 be  used  for
	       sizing and information windows.	The default is "black".

       1mDontIconifyByUnmapping 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This  variable  specifies  a list of windows that should not be
	       iconified by simply unmapping the window (as would be the  case
	       if  1mIconifyByUnmapping	 22mhad been set).  This is frequently used
	       to force some windows  to  be  treated  as  icons  while	 other
	       windows are handled by the icon manager.

       1mDontMoveOff0m
	       This  variable  indicates that windows should not be allowed to
	       be  moved  off  the  screen.   It  can  be  overridden  by  the
	       1mf.forcemove 22mfunction.

       1mDontSqueezeTitle 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable  indicates that titlebars should not be squeezed
	       to their minimum size as described  under  1mSqueezeTitle  22mbelow.
	       If  the	optional  window  list is supplied, only those windows
	       will be prevented from being squeezed.

       1mForceIcons0m
	       This variable indicates that  icon  pixmaps  specified  in  the
	       1mIcons 22mvariable should override any client-supplied pixmaps.

       1mFramePadding 4m22mpixels0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  distance	 between  the titlebar
	       decorations (the button and text) and the  window  frame.   The
	       default is 2 pixels.

       1mGrayscale 22m{ 4mcolors24m }
	       This variable specifies a list of color assignments that should
	       be made if the screen has a GrayScale default visual.  See  the
	       description of 1mColors22m.

       1mIconBackground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable specifies the background color of icons, and may
	       only be specified inside of a 1mColor22m,  1mGrayscale  22mor  1mMonochrome0m
	       list.   The  optional  4mwin-list24m  is	 a list of window names and
	       colors so that per-window colors may  be	 specified.   See  the
	       1mBorderColor  22mvariable  for	a  complete description of the 4mwin-0m
	       4mlist24m.  The default is "white".

       1mIconBorderColor 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable specifies the color of the border used  for  icon
	       windows, and may only be specified inside of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale0m
	       or 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	 The optional 4mwin-list24m is a list of  window
	       names  and  colors  so that per-window colors may be specified.
	       See the 1mBorderColor 22mvariable for a complete description of	the
	       4mwin-list24m.  The default is "black".

       1mIconBorderWidth 4m22mpixels0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  width  in  pixels of the border
	       surrounding icon windows.  The default is 2.

       1mIconMaxWidth 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the maximum width in pixels of the icon
	       window.	The default is 1024.

       1mIconDirectory 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies the directory that should be searched
	       if if a bitmap file cannot be found in any of  the  directories
	       in the 1mbitmapFilePath 22mresource.

       1mIconFont 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  font to be used to display icon
	       names within icons.  The default is "variable".

       1mIconForeground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable specifies the foreground color to	be  used  when
	       displaying  icons, and may only be specified inside of a 1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	The optional 4mwin-list24m is a	 list
	       of  window  names  and  colors so that per-window colors may be
	       specified.   See	 the  1mBorderColor  22mvariable  for  a   complete
	       description of the 4mwin-list24m.  The default is "black".

       1mIconifyByUnmapping [{ 4m22mwin-list24m 1m}]0m
	       This  variable  indicates  that	windows should be iconified by
	       being unmapped without trying to map any icons.	 This  assumes
	       that  the  user will remap the window through the icon manager,
	       the 1mf.warpto 22mfunction, or the 4mTwmWindows24m menu.	 If the optional
	       4mwin-list24m  is  provided, only those windows will be iconified by
	       simply  unmapping.   Windows  that  have	 both  this  and   the
	       1mIconManagerDontShow  22moptions  set  may  not be accessible if no
	       binding to the 4mTwmWindows24m menu is set  in  the  user's  startup
	       file.

       1mIconManagerBackground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable  specifies  the background color to use for icon
	       manager entries, and may only be specified inside of  a	1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale  22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	 The optional 4mwin-list24m is a list
	       of window names and colors so that  per-window  colors  may  be
	       specified.    See  the  1mBorderColor  22mvariable  for	a  complete
	       description of the 4mwin-list24m.  The default is "white".

       1mIconManagerDontShow 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable  indicates	 that  the  icon  manager  should  not
	       display	any  windows.  If the optional 4mwin-list24m is given, only
	       those windows will not be displayed.  This variable is used  to
	       prevent	windows	 that  are rarely iconified (such as 4mxclock24m or
	       4mxload24m) from taking up space in the icon manager.

       1mIconManagerFont 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the font to  be	used  when  displaying
	       icon manager entries.  The default is "variable".

       1mIconManagerForeground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable  specifies  the foreground color to be used when
	       displaying icon manager entries,	 and  may  only	 be  specified
	       inside  of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	 The optional
	       4mwin-list24m is a list of window names	and  colors  so	 that  per-
	       window  colors  may be specified.  See the 1mBorderColor 22mvariable
	       for a complete description of the  4mwin-list24m.   The	default	 is
	       "black".

       1mIconManagerGeometry 4m22mstring24m [ 4mcolumns24m ]
	       This  variable  specifies  the  geometry	 of  the  icon manager
	       window.	The 4mstring24m argument is standard geometry specification
	       that  indicates the initial full size of the icon manager.  The
	       icon manager window is then  broken  into  4mcolumns24m	pieces	and
	       scaled  according to the number of entries in the icon manager.
	       Extra entries are wrapped to form additional rows.  The default
	       number of columns is 1.

       1mIconManagerHighlight 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable  specifies  the  border  color  to  be used when
	       highlighting the icon manager  entry  that  currently  has  the
	       focus,  and  can only be specified inside of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale0m
	       or 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	 The optional 4mwin-list24m is a list of  window
	       names  and  colors  so that per-window colors may be specified.
	       See the 1mBorderColor 22mvariable for a complete description of	the
	       4mwin-list24m.  The default is "black".

       1mIconManagers 22m{ 4miconmgr-list24m }
	       This  variable  specifies  a  list  of icon managers to create.
	       Each item in the 4miconmgr-list24m has the following format:

			 "4mwinname24m" ["4miconname24m"]   "4mgeometry24m" 4mcolumns0m

	       where 4mwinname24m is the name of the windows  that  should  be	put
	       into  this  icon	 manager,  4miconname24m  is  the name of that icon
	       manager	window's  icon,	 4mgeometry24m	is  a	standard   geometry
	       specification,  and  4mcolumns24m  is  the number of columns in this
	       icon manager as described in 1mIconManagerGeometry22m.  For example:

		    1mIconManagers0m
		    {
			 "XTerm"   "=300x5+800+5" 5
			 "myhost"  "=400x5+100+5" 2
		    }

	       Clients	whose  name  or	 class is ``XTerm'' will have an entry
	       created in the ``XTerm'' icon manager.  Clients whose name  was
	       ``myhost'' would be put into the ``myhost'' icon manager.

       1mIconManagerShow 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear in
	       the  icon  manager.   When  used	 in   conjunction   with   the
	       1mIconManagerDontShow  22mvariable,  only  the  windows in this list
	       will be shown in the icon manager.

       1mIconRegion 4m22mgeomstring24m 4mvgrav24m 4mhgrav24m 4mgridwidth24m 4mgridheight0m
	       This variable specifies an area on the  root  window  in	 which
	       icons  are  placed  if no specific icon location is provided by
	       the client.  The 4mgeomstring24m is a  quoted  string  containing  a
	       standard	 geometry  specification.  If more than one 1mIconRegion0m
	       lines are given, icons will be put  into	 the  succeeding  icon
	       regions	when  the first is full.  The 4mvgrav24m argument should be
	       either 1mNorth 22mor 1mSouth  22mand  control  and  is  used  to	 control
	       whether icons are first filled in from the top or bottom of the
	       icon region.  Similarly, the 4mhgrav24m argument	 should	 be  either
	       1mEast  22mor  1mWest  22mand  is used to control whether icons should be
	       filled in from left from the right.  Icons are laid out	within
	       the  region  in	a  grid	 with  cells 4mgridwidth24m pixels wide and
	       4mgridheight24m pixels high.

       1mIcons 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This variable specifies a list of window names and  the	bitmap
	       filenames that should be used as their icons.  For example:

		    1mIcons0m
		    {
			 "XTerm"   "xterm.icon"
			 "xfd"		"xfd_icon"
		    }

	       Windows	that  match  ``XTerm''	and  would not be iconified by
	       unmapping, and would try to use the icon	 bitmap	 in  the  file
	       ``xterm.icon''.	 If  1mForceIcons 22mis specified, this bitmap will
	       be used even if the client has requested its own icon pixmap.

       1mInterpolateMenuColors0m
	       This variable  indicates	 that  menu  entry  colors  should  be
	       interpolated  between  entry  specified colors.	In the example
	       below:

		    1mMenu 22m"mymenu"
		    {
			 "Title"	("black":"red")		 f.title
			 "entry1"		  f.nop
			 "entry2"		  f.nop
			 "entry3"  ("white":"green")   f.nop
			 "entry4"		  f.nop
			 "entry5"  ("red":"white")	    f.nop
		    }

	       the foreground colors for ``entry1''  and  ``entry2''  will  be
	       interpolated between black and white, and the background colors
	       between	red  and  green.   Similarly,	the   foreground   for
	       ``entry4''  will	 be  half-way  between	white and red, and the
	       background will be half-way between green and white.

       1mMakeTitle 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This variable specifies a list of windows on which  a  titlebar
	       should  be  placed  and	is  used to request titles on specific
	       windows when 1mNoTitle 22mhas been set.

       1mMaxWindowSize 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies a  geometry  in	which  the  width  and
	       height  give  the  maximum  size	 for  a given window.  This is
	       typically used to restrict windows to the size of  the  screen.
	       The  default width is 32767 - screen width.  The default height
	       is 32767 - screen height.

       1mMenuBackground 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the background color  used  for	menus,
	       and can only be specified inside of a 1mColor 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.
	       The default is "white".

       1mMenuBorderColor 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the color of the menu  border  and  can
	       only  be	 specified  inside of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome0m
	       list.  The default is "black".

       1mMenuBorderWidth 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding menu windows.  The default is 2.

       1mMenuFont 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable specifies the font to use when displaying menus.
	       The default is "variable".

       1mMenuForeground 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the foreground color  used  for	menus,
	       and  can	 only  be  specified  inside  of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale 22mor
	       1mMonochrome 22mlist.  The default is "black".

       1mMenuShadowColor 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable specifies the color of the	 shadow	 behind	 pull-
	       down  menus  and	 can  only  be	specified  inside  of a 1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	The default is "black".

       1mMenuTitleBackground 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  background  color  for  1mf.title0m
	       entries	in menus, and can only be specified inside of a 1mColor22m,
	       1mGrayscale 22mor 1mMonochrome 22mlist.	The default is "white".

       1mMenuTitleForeground 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  foreground  color  for  1mf.title0m
	       entries in menus and can only be specified inside of a 1mColor 22mor
	       1mMonochrome 22mlist.  The default is "black".

       1mMonochrome 22m{ 4mcolors24m }
	       This variable specifies a list of color assignments that should
	       be made if the screen has a depth of 1.	See the description of
	       1mColors22m.

       1mMoveDelta 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the number of pixels the	 pointer  must
	       move  before  the 1mf.move 22mfunction starts working.  Also see the
	       1mf.deltastop 22mfunction.  The default is zero pixels.

       1mNoBackingStore0m
	       This variable indicates that 4mtwm24m's	menus  should  not  request
	       backing	store  to  minimize  repainting	 of  menus.   This  is
	       typically used with servers that can repaint faster  than  they
	       can handle backing store.

       1mNoCaseSensitive0m
	       This  variable  indicates  that	case  should  be  ignored when
	       sorting	icon  names  in	 an  icon  manager.   This  option  is
	       typically  used	with  applications  that  capitalize the first
	       letter of their icon name.

       1mNoDefaults0m
	       This variable indicates that 4mtwm24m should not supply the  default
	       titlebuttons  and bindings.  This option should only be used if
	       the startup file contains a completely new set of bindings  and
	       definitions.

       1mNoGrabServer0m
	       This  variable  indicates  that	4mtwm24m should not grab the server
	       when popping up menus and moving opaque windows.

       1mNoHighlight 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable indicates that borders should not be  highlighted
	       to track the location of the pointer.  If the optional 4mwin-list0m
	       is given, highlighting will only be disabled for those windows.
	       When the border is highlighted, it will be drawn in the current
	       1mBorderColor22m.  When the border is not highlighted,  it  will	 be
	       stippled	   with	   a	gray   pattern	 using	 the   current
	       1mBorderTileForeground 22mand 1mBorderTileBackground 22mcolors.

       1mNoIconManagers0m
	       This variable indicates that no icon manager should be created.

       1mNoMenuShadows0m
	       This variable indicates that menus should not have drop shadows
	       drawn behind them.  This is typically used with slower  servers
	       since  it  speeds  up menu drawing at the expense of making the
	       menu slightly harder to read.

       1mNoRaiseOnDeiconify0m
	       This variable  indicates	 that  windows	that  are  deiconified
	       should not be raised.

       1mNoRaiseOnMove0m
	       This  variable indicates that windows should not be raised when
	       moved.  This is	typically  used	 to  allow  windows  to	 slide
	       underneath each other.

       1mNoRaiseOnResize0m
	       This  variable indicates that windows should not be raised when
	       resized.	 This is typically used to allow windows to be resized
	       underneath each other.

       1mNoRaiseOnWarp0m
	       This  variable indicates that windows should not be raised when
	       the pointer is warped into them with the 1mf.warpto 22mfunction.	 If
	       this option is set, warping to an occluded window may result in
	       the pointer ending up  in  the  occluding  window  instead  the
	       desired	 window	  (which   causes   unexpected	behavior  with
	       1mf.warpring22m).

       1mNoSaveUnders0m
	       This variable indicates that menus  should  not	request	 save-
	       unders  to minimize window repainting following menu selection.
	       It is typically used with displays that can repaint faster than
	       they can handle save-unders.

       1mNoStackMode 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This  variable  indicates that client window requests to change
	       stacking order should be ignored.  If the optional 4mwin-list24m	 is
	       given, only requests on those windows will be ignored.  This is
	       typically  used	to  prevent  applications  from	  relentlessly
	       popping themselves to the front of the window stack.

       1mNoTitle 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable indicates that windows should not have titlebars.
	       If the optional 4mwin-list24m is given, only those windows will	not
	       have  titlebars.	  1mMakeTitle  22mmay  be  used with this option to
	       force titlebars to be put on specific windows.

       1mNoTitleFocus0m
	       This variable indicates that 4mtwm24m should not set keyboard  input
	       focus  to each window as it is entered.	Normally, 4mtwm24m sets the
	       focus so that focus and key events from the titlebar  and  icon
	       managers	 are  delivered to the application.  If the pointer is
	       moved quickly and 4mtwm24m is slow to respond, input can be directed
	       to the old window instead of the new.  This option is typically
	       used to prevent this ``input lag'' and to work around  bugs  in
	       older applications that have problems with focus events.

       1mNoTitleHighlight 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This   variable	indicates  that	 the  highlight	 area  of  the
	       titlebar, which is used to indicate the window  that  currently
	       has  the input focus, should not be displayed.  If the optional
	       4mwin-list24m is given, only those windows will not  have  highlight
	       areas.	This  and  the	1mSqueezeTitle	22moptions  can	 be  set to
	       substantially reduce the amount of  screen  space  required  by
	       titlebars.

       1mOpaqueMove0m
	       This   variable	indicates  that	 the  1mf.move	22mfunction  should
	       actually move the window instead of just an outline so that the
	       user  can immediately see what the window will look like in the
	       new position.  This option is typically used on	fast  displays
	       (particularly if 1mNoGrabServer 22mis set).

       1mPixmaps 22m{ 4mpixmaps24m }
	       This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  pixmaps that define the
	       appearance  of  various	images.	  Each	entry  is  a   keyword
	       indicating  the	pixmap to set, followed by a string giving the
	       name  of	 the  bitmap  file.   The  following  pixmaps  may  be
	       specified:

		    1mPixmaps0m
		    {
			 TitleHighlight "gray1"
		    }

	       The  default  for  4mTitleHighlight24m  is  to  use  an even stipple
	       pattern.

       1mPriority 4m22mpriority0m
	       This variable sets  4mtwm24m's  priority.   4mpriority24m  should  be  an
	       unquoted,  signed  number  (e.g.	 999).	 This  variable has an
	       effect only if the server supports the SYNC extension.

       1mRandomPlacement0m
	       This variable indicates that windows with no specified geometry
	       should  be placed in a pseudo-random location instead of having
	       the user drag out an outline.

       1mResizeFont 4m22mstring0m
	       This variable  specifies	 the  font  to	be  used  for  in  the
	       dimensions  window  when	 resizing  windows.   The  default  is
	       "fixed".

       1mRestartPreviousState0m
	       This variable indicates that 4mtwm24m  should  attempt  to  use	the
	       WM_STATE	 property  on  client  windows	to  tell which windows
	       should be iconified and which should be left visible.  This  is
	       typically  used	to try to regenerate the state that the screen
	       was in before the previous window manager was shutdown.

       1mSaveColor 22m{ 4mcolors-list24m }
	       This variable indicates a  list	of  color  assignments	to  be
	       stored	as   pixel   values   in   the	root  window  property
	       _MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS.  Clients  may  elect  to  preserve	 these
	       values  when  installing	 their own colormap.  Note that use of
	       this mechanism is  a  way  an  for  application	to  avoid  the
	       "technicolor"  problem,	whereby	 useful screen objects such as
	       window borders and titlebars disappear when a  programs	custom
	       colors are installed by the window manager.  For example:

		    1mSaveColor0m
		    {
			 BorderColor
			 TitleBackground
			 TitleForeground
			 "red"
			 "green"
			 "blue"
		    }

	       This  would place on the root window 3 pixel values for borders
	       and titlebars, as well as the three color  strings,  all	 taken
	       from the default colormap.

       1mShowIconManager0m
	       This  variable indicates that the icon manager window should be
	       displayed when 4mtwm24m is started.  It can  always  be	brought	 up
	       using the 1mf.showiconmgr 22mfunction.

       1mSortIconManager0m
	       This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager should
	       be sorted alphabetically rather than by	simply	appending  new
	       windows to the end.

       1mSqueezeTitle 22m[{ 4msqueeze-list24m }]
	       This  variable  indicates  that	4mtwm24m  should attempt to use the
	       SHAPE extension to make titlebars occupy only  as  much	screen
	       space  as  they	need, rather than extending all the way across
	       the top of the window.  The optional 4msqueeze-list24m may  be  used
	       to  control the location of the squeezed titlebar along the top
	       of the window.  It contains entries of the form:

			 "4mname24m"	     4mjustification24m	 4mnum24m  4mdenom0m

	       where 4mname24m is a window  name,  4mjustification24m  is  either  1mleft22m,
	       1mcenter22m,  or	 1mright22m,  and 4mnum24m and 4mdenom24m are numbers specifying a
	       ratio giving the relative position about which the titlebar  is
	       justified.   The	 ratio	is  measured from left to right if the
	       numerator is positive,  and  right  to  left  if	 negative.   A
	       denominator  of	0  indicates  that  the	 numerator  should  be
	       measured in pixels.  For convenience, the ratio 0/0 is the same
	       as 1/2 for 1mcenter 22mand -1/1 for 1mright22m.	For example:

		    1mSqueezeTitle0m
		    {
			 "XTerm"   left	     0	  0
			 "xterm1"  left	     1	  3
			 "xterm2"  left	     2	  3
			 "oclock"  center	  0    0
			 "emacs"   right	  0    0
		    }

	       The  1mDontSqueezeTitle 22mlist can be used to turn off squeezing on
	       certain titles.

       1mStartIconified 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable indicates that client windows should initially be
	       left as icons until explicitly deiconified by the user.	If the
	       optional 4mwin-list24m is given, only those windows will be  started
	       iconic.	 This  is  useful  for programs that do not support an
	       4m-iconic24m command line option or resource.

       1mTitleBackground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable specifies the background color used in titlebars,
	       and  may	 only  be  specified  inside  of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale 22mor
	       1mMonochrome 22mlist.  The optional 4mwin-list24m is  a	list  of  window
	       names  and  colors  so that per-window colors may be specified.
	       The default is "white".

       1mTitleButtonBorderWidth 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding  titlebuttons.  This is typically set to 0 to allow
	       titlebuttons to take up as much space as possible  and  to  not
	       have a border.  The default is 1.

       1mTitleFont 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  font  to be used for displaying
	       window names in titlebars.  The default is "variable".

       1mTitleForeground 4m22mstring24m [{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable specifies the foreground color used in titlebars,
	       and  may	 only  be  specified  inside  of a 1mColor22m, 1mGrayscale 22mor
	       1mMonochrome 22mlist.  The optional 4mwin-list24m is  a	list  of  window
	       names  and  colors  so that per-window colors may be specified.
	       The default is "black".

       1mTitleIndent 4m22mpixels0m
	       This variable specifies the amount by which window name	should
	       be indented on the left.	 The default is 0.

       1mTitlePadding 4m22mpixels0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  distance	 between  the  various
	       buttons, text,  and  highlight  areas  in  the  titlebar.   The
	       default is 8 pixels.

       1mUnknownIcon 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  the  filename of a bitmap file to be
	       used as the default icon.  This bitmap will be used as the icon
	       of  all clients which do not provide an icon bitmap and are not
	       listed in the 1mIcons 22mlist.

       1mUsePPosition 4m22mstring0m
	       This  variable  specifies  whether  or  not  4mtwm24m  should  honor
	       program-requested locations (given by the 1mPPosition 22mflag in the
	       WM_NORMAL_HINTS property) in the absence	 of  a	user-specified
	       position.   The	argument  4mstring24m may have one of three values:
	       1m"off" 22m(the default)	 indicating  that  4mtwm24m  should  ignore  the
	       program-supplied	 position,  1m"on"  22mindicating that the position
	       should be used, and 1m"non-zero"	 22mindicating	that  the  position
	       should  used  if	 it is other than (0,0).  The latter option is
	       for working around a bug in older toolkits.

       1mWarpCursor 22m[{ 4mwin-list24m }]
	       This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped  into
	       windows when they are deiconified.  If the optional 4mwin-list24m is
	       given, the pointer will only be warped when those  windows  are
	       deiconified.

       1mWindowRing 22m{ 4mwin-list24m }
	       This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  windows along which the
	       1mf.warpring 22mfunction cycles.

       1mWarpUnmapped0m
	       This variable  indicates	 that  the  1mf.warpto	22mfunction  should
	       deiconify   any	iconified  windows  it	encounters.   This  is
	       typically used to make a key binding that will pop a particular
	       window  (such  as  4mxmh24m), no matter where it is.  The default is
	       for 1mf.warpto 22mto ignore iconified windows.

       1mXorValue 4m22mnumber0m
	       This variable specifies the value to use	 when  drawing	window
	       outlines	 for  moving  and  resizing.   This should be set to a
	       value that will result  in  a  variety  of  of  distinguishable
	       colors  when  exclusive-or'ed  with  the contents of the user's
	       typical screen.	Setting this variable to 1  often  gives  nice
	       results	 if  adjacent  colors  in  the	default	 colormap  are
	       distinct.  By default, 4mtwm24m	will  attempt  to  cause  temporary
	       lines  to  appear  at the opposite end of the colormap from the
	       graphics.

       1mZoom 22m[ 4mcount24m ]
	       This variable indicates that outlines suggesting movement of  a
	       window  to  and	from  its  iconified state should be displayed
	       whenever a window is iconified or  deiconified.	 The  optional
	       4mcount24m  argument  specifies	the number of outlines to be drawn.
	       The default count is 8.

       The following variables must be set after the fonts have been assigned,
       so  it  is  usually  best  to  put  them at the end of the variables or
       beginning of the bindings sections:

       1mDefaultFunction 4m22mfunction0m
	       This variable specifies the function to be executed when a  key
	       or  button  event is received for which no binding is provided.
	       This is typically bound to 1mf.nop22m, 1mf.beep22m, or a menu  containing
	       window operations.

       1mWindowFunction 4m22mfunction0m
	       This  variable  specifies the function to execute when a window
	       is selected from the 1mTwmWindows 22mmenu.  If this variable is	not
	       set, the window will be deiconified and raised.

1mBINDINGS0m
       After  the  desired  variables have been set, functions may be attached
       titlebuttons and key and pointer buttons.  Titlebuttons	may  be	 added
       from  the  left	or right side and appear in the titlebar from left-to-
       right according to the order in which  they  are	 specified.   Key  and
       pointer button bindings may be given in any order.

       Titlebuttons  specifications must include the name of the pixmap to use
       in the button box and the function to be invoked when a pointer	button
       is pressed within them:

	    1mLeftTitleButton 22m"4mbitmapname24m"  = 4mfunction0m

       or

	    1mRightTitleButton 22m"4mbitmapname24m" = 4mfunction0m

       The  4mbitmapname24m  may  refer	 to one of the	built-in bitmaps (which are
       scaled to match 1mTitleFont22m) by using the appropriate colon-prefixed name
       described above.

       Key and pointer button specifications must give the modifiers that must
       be pressed, over which parts of the screen the  pointer	must  be,  and
       what  function  is to be invoked.  Keys are given as strings containing
       the  appropriate	 keysym	 name;	buttons	 are  given  as	 the  keywords
       1mButton122m-1mButton522m:

	    "FP1"	   = 4mmodlist24m : 4mcontext24m : 4mfunction0m
	    1mButton1	22m= 4mmodlist24m : 4mcontext24m : 4mfunction0m

       The  4mmodlist24m  is  any combination of the modifier names 1mshift22m, 1mcontrol22m,
       1mlock22m, 1mmeta22m, 1mmod122m, 1mmod222m, 1mmod322m, 1mmod422m, or 1mmod5 22m(which may  be  abbreviated
       as  1ms22m,  1mc22m,  1ml22m,  1mm22m,  1mm122m,	 1mm222m,  1mm322m,  1mm422m, 1mm522m, respectively) separated by a
       vertical bar (|).  Similarly, the 4mcontext24m is any combination of 1mwindow22m,
       1mtitle22m,  1micon22m,	1mroot22m,  1mframe22m,	 1miconmgr22m,	their  first  letters  (1miconmgr0m
       abbreviation is 1mm22m), or 1mall22m, separated by a vertical bar.  The	4mfunction0m
       is  any	of the 1mf.  22mkeywords described below.  For example, the default
       startup file contains the following bindings:

	    Button1   =	   : root	  : f.menu "TwmWindows"
	    Button1   = m  : window | icon     : f.function "move-or-lower"
	    Button2   = m  : window | icon     : f.iconify
	    Button3   = m  : window | icon     : f.function "move-or-raise"
	    Button1   =	   : title	  : f.function "move-or-raise"
	    Button2   =	   : title	  : f.raiselower
	    Button1   =	   : icon	  : f.function "move-or-iconify"
	    Button2   =	   : icon	  : f.iconify
	    Button1   =	   : iconmgr : f.iconify
	    Button2   =	   : iconmgr : f.iconify

       A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows  from	 the  keyboard
       could use the following bindings:

	    "F1" =    : all	     : f.iconify
	    "F2" =    : all	     : f.raiselower
	    "F3" =    : all	     : f.warpring "next"
	    "F4" =    : all	     : f.warpto "xmh"
	    "F5" =    : all	     : f.warpto "emacs"
	    "F6" =    : all	     : f.colormap "next"
	    "F7" =    : all	     : f.colormap "default"
	    "F20"     =	   : all	  : f.warptoscreen "next"
	    "Left"    = m  : all	  : f.backiconmgr
	    "Right"   = m | s	: all	       : f.forwiconmgr
	    "Up" = m  : all	     : f.upiconmgr
	    "Down"    = m | s	: all	       : f.downiconmgr

       4mTwm24m	 provides  many	 more  window  manipulation  primitives than can be
       conveniently stored in a	 titlebar,  menu,  or  set  of	key  bindings.
       Although a small set of defaults are supplied (unless the 1mNoDefaults 22mis
       specified), most users will want to have their most  common  operations
       bound to key and button strokes.	 To do this, 4mtwm24m associates names with
       each of the primitives and provides 4muser-defined24m 4mfunctions24m for building
       higher  level  primitives  and  4mmenus24m for interactively selecting among
       groups of functions.

       User-defined functions contain the name by which they are referenced in
       calls  to  1mf.function	22mand	a  list of other functions to execute.	For
       example:

	    Function "move-or-lower" { f.move f.deltastop f.lower }
	    Function "move-or-raise" { f.move f.deltastop f.raise }
	    Function "move-or-iconify"	  { f.move f.deltastop f.iconify }
	    Function "restore-colormap"	  { f.colormap "default" f.lower }

       The function name must be used in 1mf.function 22mexactly as it	appears	 in
       the function specification.

       In  the	descriptions  below, if the function is said to operate on the
       selected window, but is invoked from a root menu, the  cursor  will  be
       changed	to  the	 1mSelect 22mcursor and the next window to receive a button
       press will be chosen:

       1m! 4m22mstring0m
	       This is an abbreviation for 1mf.exec 4m22mstring24m.

       1mf.autoraise0m
	       This function toggles whether or not  the  selected  window  is
	       raised whenever entered by the pointer.	See the description of
	       the variable 1mAutoRaise22m.

       1mf.backiconmgr0m
	       This function warps the pointer to the previous column  in  the
	       current	icon  manager,	wrapping  back	to the previous row if
	       necessary.

       1mf.beep	 22mThis function sounds the keyboard bell.

       1mf.bottomzoom0m
	       This function  is  similar  to  the  1mf.fullzoom  22mfunction,	but
	       resizes	the window to fill only the bottom half of the screen.

       1mf.changelabel0m
	       This function enters a mode where the user is able to change  a
	       window  or an icon title. It grabs the keyboard and ignores all
	       other events, so the only way to exit  from  this  mode	is  to
	       press  Enter  (confirm  a  new  title)  or  Escape (restore the
	       original title) keys.

       1mf.circledown0m
	       This function lowers the top-most window that occludes  another
	       window.

       1mf.circleup0m
	       This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded by
	       another window.

       1mf.colormap 4m22mstring0m
	       This  function  rotates	the  colormaps	(obtained   from   the
	       WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS  property  on  the  window)	that  4mtwm24m will
	       display when the pointer	 is  in	 this  window.	 The  argument
	       4mstring24m  may	 have  one of the following values: 1m"next"22m, 1m"prev"22m,
	       and 1m"default"22m.  It should be noted here that  in  general,	the
	       installed  colormap is determined by keyboard focus.  A pointer
	       driven keyboard focus will  install  a  private	colormap  upon
	       entry  of  the  window owning the colormap.  Using the click to
	       type model, private colormaps will not be installed  until  the
	       user presses a mouse button on the target window.

       1mf.deiconify0m
	       This  function  deiconifies the selected window.	 If the window
	       is not an icon, this function does nothing.

       1mf.delete0m
	       This  function  sends  the  WM_DELETE_WINDOW  message  to   the
	       selected	 window	 if  the  client  application has requested it
	       through the WM_PROTOCOLS window property.  The  application  is
	       supposed	 to  respond  to the message by removing the indicated
	       window.	If  the	 window	 has  not  requested  WM_DELETE_WINDOW
	       messages,  the  keyboard	 bell will be rung indicating that the
	       user should choose an alternative method.  Note	this  is  very
	       different  from	f.destroy.   The  intent  here	is to delete a
	       single window,  not necessarily the entire application.

       1mf.deltastop0m
	       This function allows a user-defined function to be  aborted  if
	       the pointer has been moved more than 4mMoveDelta24m pixels.  See the
	       example definition given for 1mFunction	"move-or-raise"	 22mat	the
	       beginning of the section.

       1mf.destroy0m
	       This  function  instructs  the  X  server  to close the display
	       connection of the client	 that  created	the  selected  window.
	       This  should  only  be  used as a last resort for shutting down
	       runaway clients.	 See also f.delete.

       1mf.downiconmgr0m
	       This function warps the pointer to the next row in the  current
	       icon  manger,  wrapping	to the beginning of the next column if
	       necessary.

       1mf.exec 4m22mstring0m
	       This  function  passes  the  argument  4mstring24m  to  /bin/sh	for
	       execution.   In	multiscreen  mode,  if	4mstring24m  starts a new X
	       client without giving  a	 display  argument,  the  client  will
	       appear on the screen from which this function was invoked.

       1mf.focus 22mThis  function  toggles the keyboard focus of the server to the
	       selected window, changing the focus rule from pointer-driven if
	       necessary.   If	the  selected window already was focused, this
	       function executes an 1mf.unfocus22m.

       1mf.forcemove0m
	       This function  is  like	1mf.move  22mexcept  that  it  ignores	the
	       1mDontMoveOff 22mvariable.

       1mf.forwiconmgr0m
	       This  function  warps  the  pointer  to	the next column in the
	       current icon manager, wrapping to the beginning of the next row
	       if necessary.

       1mf.fullzoom0m
	       This  function  resizes the selected window to the full size of
	       the display or else restores the original size  if  the	window
	       was already zoomed.

       1mf.function 4m22mstring0m
	       This  function executes the user-defined function whose name is
	       specified by the argument 4mstring24m.

       1mf.hbzoom0m
	       This function is a synonym for 1mf.bottomzoom22m.

       1mf.hideiconmgr0m
	       This function unmaps the current icon manager.

       1mf.horizoom0m
	       This variable is similar to the 1mf.zoom 22mfunction except that the
	       selected window is resized to the full width of the display.

       1mf.htzoom0m
	       This function is a synonym for 1mf.topzoom22m.

       1mf.hzoom 22mThis function is a synonym for 1mf.horizoom22m.

       1mf.iconify0m
	       This  function  iconifies or deiconifies the selected window or
	       icon, respectively.

       1mf.identify0m
	       This function displays a summary of the name  and  geometry  of
	       the   selected	window.	  If  the  server  supports  the  SYNC
	       extension, the priority of the client owning the window is also
	       displayed.   Clicking  the  pointer  or	pressing  a key in the
	       window will dismiss it.

       1mf.lefticonmgr0m
	       This function similar to	 1mf.backiconmgr  22mexcept  that  wrapping
	       does not change rows.

       1mf.leftzoom0m
	       This  variable  is  similar  to	the  1mf.bottomzoom 22mfunction but
	       causes the selected window is only resized to the left half  of
	       the display.

       1mf.lower 22mThis function lowers the selected window.

       1mf.menu 4m22mstring0m
	       This  function  invokes	the  menu  specified  by  the argument
	       a4mstring24m.  If a string starts  with	a  $-symbols,  it  will	 be
	       expanded	 as  an	 environment  variable.	 Cascaded menus may be
	       built by nesting calls to 1mf.menu22m.

       1mf.move	 22mThis function drags an outline of the selected window  (or	the
	       window  itself  if  the	1mOpaqueMove  22mvariable is set) until the
	       invoking pointer button is released.   Double  clicking	within
	       the  number  of milliseconds given by 1mConstrainedMoveTime 22mwarps
	       the pointer to the center of the window and constrains the move
	       to  be  either  horizontal  or vertical depending on which grid
	       line is crossed.	 To abort a move, press another button	before
	       releasing the first button.

       1mf.nexticonmgr0m
	       This  function  warps  the  pointer  to	the  next icon manager
	       containing any windows on the current or any succeeding screen.

       1mf.nop	 22mThis  function  does  nothing  and	is  typically used with the
	       1mDefaultFunction 22mor 1mWindowFunction	 22mvariables  or  to  introduce
	       blank lines in menus.

       1mf.previconmgr0m
	       This  function  warps  the pointer to the previous icon manager
	       containing any windows on the current or preceding screens.

       1mf.priority 4m22mstring0m
	       This function sets  the	priority  of  the  client  owning  the
	       selected	 window	 to  the numeric value of the argument 4mstring24m,
	       which should be a signed integer in double quotes  (e.g.	 "999"
	       ).  This function has an effect only if the server supports the
	       SYNC extension.

       1mf.quit	 22mThis function causes 4mtwm24m to restore the  window's  borders  and
	       exit.   If  4mtwm24m is the first client invoked from 4mxdm24m, this will
	       result in a server reset.

       1mf.raise 22mThis function raises the selected window.

       1mf.raiselower0m
	       This function raises the selected window	 to  the  top  of  the
	       stacking	 order if it is occluded by any windows, otherwise the
	       window will be lowered.

       1mf.refresh0m
	       This function causes all windows to be refreshed.

       1mf.resize0m
	       This function displays  an  outline  of	the  selected  window.
	       Crossing	 a  border  (or setting 1mAutoRelativeResize22m) will cause
	       the outline to begin to rubber band until the  invoking	button
	       is  released.   To  abort a resize, press another button before
	       releasing the first button.

       1mf.restart0m
	       This function kills and restarts 4mtwm24m.

       1mf.startwm 4m22mstring0m
	       This function kills 4mtwm24m and starts another window  manager,	 as
	       specified by 4mstring24m.

       1mf.righticonmgr0m
	       This  function is similar to 1mf.nexticonmgr 22mexcept that wrapping
	       does not change rows.

       1mf.rightzoom0m
	       This variable is similar to the	1mf.bottomzoom	22mfunction  except
	       that  the  selected window is only resized to the right half of
	       the display.

       1mf.saveyourself0m
	       This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to	 the  selected
	       window  if  it  has  requested  the message in its WM_PROTOCOLS
	       window property.	 Clients that accept this message are supposed
	       to  checkpoint  all state associated with the window and update
	       the WM_COMMAND property as specified  in	 the  ICCCM.   If  the
	       selected window has not selected for this message, the keyboard
	       bell will be rung.

       1mf.showiconmgr0m
	       This function maps the current icon manager.

       1mf.sorticonmgr0m
	       This function sorts the entries in  the	current	 icon  manager
	       alphabetically.	See the variable 1mSortIconManager22m.

       1mf.title 22mThis  function provides a centered, unselectable item in a menu
	       definition.  It should not be used in any other context.

       1mf.topzoom0m
	       This variable is similar to the	1mf.bottomzoom	22mfunction  except
	       that the selected window is only resized to the top half of the
	       display.

       1mf.unfocus0m
	       This function resets the focus back  to	pointer-driven.	  This
	       should be used when a focused window is no longer desired.

       1mf.upiconmgr0m
	       This  function  warps  the  pointer  to the previous row in the
	       current icon manager, wrapping to the  last  row	 in  the  same
	       column if necessary.

       1mf.vlzoom0m
	       This function is a synonym for 1mf.leftzoom22m.

       1mf.vrzoom0m
	       This function is a synonym for 1mf.rightzoom22m.

       1mf.totalzoom0m
	       This  function  resizes the selected window to the full size of
	       the display or else restores the original size  if  the	window
	       was  already  zoomed.  Zoomed window covers the whole area of a
	       screen, without even window manager decoration.

       1mf.warpring 4m22mstring0m
	       This function warps the pointer to the next or previous	window
	       (as  indicated  by  the argument 4mstring24m, which may be 1m"next" 22mor
	       1m"prev"22m) specified in the 1mWindowRing 22mvariable.

       1mf.warpto 4m22mstring0m
	       This function warps the pointer to the window which has a  name
	       or  class  that matches 4mstring24m.  If the window is iconified, it
	       will be deiconified if the variable 1mWarpUnmapped 22mis set or else
	       ignored.

       1mf.warptoiconmgr 4m22mstring0m
	       This  function  warps  the  pointer  to	the icon manager entry
	       associated with the window containing the pointer in  the  icon
	       manager	specified  by the argument 4mstring24m.	 If 4mstring24m is empty
	       (i.e. ""), the current icon manager is chosen.

       1mf.warptoscreen 4m22mstring0m
	       This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by  the
	       argument 4mstring24m.  4mString24m may be a number (e.g. 1m"0" 22mor 1m"1"22m), the
	       word 1m"next" 22m(indicating the current	 screen	 plus  1,  skipping
	       over  any  unmanaged  screens), the word 1m"back" 22m(indicating the
	       current screen minus 1, skipping over any  unmanaged  screens),
	       or the word 1m"prev" 22m(indicating the last screen visited.

       1mf.winrefresh0m
	       This  function is similar to the 1mf.refresh 22mfunction except that
	       only the selected window is refreshed.

       1mf.zoom	 22mThis function is similar to	 the  1mf.fullzoom  22mfunction,  except
	       that the only the height of the selected window is changed.

1mMENUS0m
       Functions  may be grouped and interactively selected using pop-up (when
       bound to a  pointer  button)  or	 pull-down  (when  associated  with  a
       titlebutton)  menus.   Each menu specification contains the name of the
       menu as it will be referred to by 1mf.menu22m, optional	default	 foreground
       and  background	colors,	 the list of item names and the functions they
       should invoke,  and  optional  foreground  and  background  colors  for
       individual items:

	    1mMenu 22m"4mmenuname24m" [ ("4mdeffore24m":"4mdefback24m") ]
	    {
		 4mstring124m	[ ("4mfore124m":"4mbackn24m")]	   4mfunction10m
		 4mstring224m	[ ("4mfore224m":"4mbackn24m")]	   4mfunction20m
		      .
		      .
		      .
		 4mstringN24m	[ ("4mforeN24m":"4mbackN24m")]	   4mfunctionN0m
	    }


       The  4mmenuname24m  is  case-sensitive.	 The  optional	4mdeffore24m and 4mdefback0m
       arguments specify the foreground and background colors used on a	 color
       display	to  highlight  menu  entries.  The 4mstring24m portion of each menu
       entry will be the text which will appear in  the	 menu.	 The  optional
       4mfore24m and 4mback24m arguments specify the foreground and background colors of
       the menu entry when the pointer is not in the entry.  These colors will
       only  be	 used  on  a  color display.  The default is to use the colors
       specified by the	 1mMenuForeground  22mand  1mMenuBackground  22mvariables.   The
       4mfunction24m  portion  of the menu entry is one of the functions, including
       any user-defined functions, or additional menus.

       There is a special menu named 1mTwmWindows 22mwhich contains  the  names	 of
       all  of	the  client and 4mtwm24m-supplied windows.  Selecting an entry will
       cause  the  1mWindowFunction  22mto  be	executed  on   that   window.	 If
       1mWindowFunction	 22mhasn't  been  set,	the  window will be deiconified and
       raised.

1mICONS0m
       4mTwm24m supports several different ways of manipulating iconified  windows.
       The   common   pixmap-and-text  style  may  be  laid  out  by  hand  or
       automatically arranged as described by  the  1mIconRegion  22mvariable.	 In
       addition,  a terse grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides
       a more efficient use of screen space as well as the ability to navigate
       among windows from the keyboard.

       An  icon	 manager  is  a	 window that contains names of selected or all
       windows currently on the display.  In addition to the  window  name,  a
       small  button using the default iconify symbol will be displayed to the
       left of the name when the window is iconified.  By default, clicking on
       an entry in the icon manager performs 1mf.iconify22m.  To change the actions
       taken in the icon manager, use the the 1miconmgr 22mcontext when	 specifying
       button and keyboard bindings.

       Moving the pointer into the icon manager also directs keyboard focus to
       the indicated window (setting the  focus	 explicitly  or	 else  sending
       synthetic   events   1mNoTitleFocus  22mis  set).   Using  the  1mf.upiconmgr22m,
       1mf.downiconmgr f.lefticonmgr22m, and 1mf.righticonmgr  22mfunctions,  the  input
       focus can be changed between windows directly from the keyboard.

1mBUGS0m
       The resource manager should have been used instead of all of the window
       lists.

       The 1mIconRegion 22mvariable should take a list.

       Double clicking very fast to get the  constrained  move	function  will
       sometimes  cause	 the  window  to  move, even though the pointer is not
       moved.

       If   1mIconifyByUnmapping   22mis   on	and   windows	are    listed	 in
       1mIconManagerDontShow 22mbut not in 1mDontIconifyByUnmapping22m, they may be lost
       if they are  iconified  and  no	bindings  to  1mf.menu	"TwmWindows"  22mor
       1mf.warpto 22mare setup.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mucs2any 22mallows one to generate from an ISO	10646-1	 encoded  BDF  font
       other  BDF  fonts  in  any possible encoding.  This way, one can derive
       from a single ISO 10646-1 master font a whole set of 8-bit fonts in all
       ISO 8859 and various other encodings.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m+d	22mputs	 DEC VT100 graphics characters in the C0 range (default for
	      upright, character-cell fonts).

       1m-d	22momits DEC VT100 graphics characters from the C0  range  (default
	      for all font types except upright, character-cell fonts).

1mOPERANDS0m
       4msource-name0m
	      is the name of an ISO 10646-1 encoded BDF file.

       4mmapping-file0m
	      is   the	 name	of   a	character  set	table  like  those  at
	      1m<ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/>22m.  These files can  also
	      typically	      be       found	   installed	   in	   the
	      4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/util/24m directory.

       4mregistry-encoding0m
	      are the CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING field  values  for
	      the  font name (XLFD) of the target font, separated by a hyphen.

       Any number of 4mmapping-file24m and 4mregistry-encoding24m operand pairs	 may  be
       specified.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       The command
	      ucs2any 6x13.bdf 8859-1.TXT iso8859-1 8859-2.TXT iso8859-2
       will generate the files 4m6x13-iso8859-1.bdf24m and 4m6x13-iso8859-2.bdf24m.

1mFUTURE DIRECTIONS0m
       Hopefully  a  future  XFree86  release  will have a facility similar to
       1mucs2any 22mbuilt into the server, and reencode ISO  10646-1  on  the  fly,
       because storing the same fonts in many different encodings is clearly a
       waste of storage capacity.

VIEWRES(1)							    VIEWRES(1)



1mNAME0m
       viewres - graphical class browser for Xt

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mviewres 22m[-option ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mviewres24m program displays a tree showing the widget class hierarchy
       of the Athena Widget Set.  Each node in the tree	 can  be  expanded  to
       show  the  resources  that  the corresponding class adds (i.e. does not
       inherit from its parent) when a widget is  created.   This  application
       allows  the  user  to  visually	examine	 the  structure	 and inherited
       resources for the Athena Widget Set.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mViewres24m accepts all of the standard toolkit	 command  line	options	 as
       well as the following:

       1m-top 4m22mname0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  name of the highest widget in the
	       hierarchy to display.  This is  typically  used	to  limit  the
	       display to a subset of the tree.	 The default is 4mObject24m.

       1m-variable0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  the  widget  variable  names (as
	       declared in header files) should	 be  displayed	in  the	 nodes
	       rather than the widget class name.  This is sometimes useful to
	       distinguish widget classes that share the same  name  (such  as
	       4mText24m).

       1m-vertical0m
	       This  option indicates that the tree should be displayed top to
	       bottom rather left to right.

1mVIEW MENU0m
       The way in which the tree is  displayed	may  be	 changed  through  the
       entries in the 1mView 22mmenu:

       1mShow Variable Names0m
	       This  entry  causes  the	 node labels to be set to the variable
	       names used to declare the  corresponding	 widget	 class.	  This
	       operation may also be performed with the 1mSetLabelType(variable)0m
	       translation.

       1mShow Class Names0m
	       This entry causes the node labels to be set to the class	 names
	       used  when  specifying  resources.   This operation may also be
	       performed with the 1mSetLabelType(class) 22mtranslation.

       1mLayout Horizontal0m
	       This entry causes the tree to be laid out from left  to	right.
	       This    operation    may	   also	   be	performed   with   the
	       4mSetOrientation(West)24m translation.

       1mLayout Vertical0m
	       This entry causes the tree to be laid out from top  to  bottom.
	       This    operation    may	   also	   be	performed   with   the
	       4mSetOrientation(North)24m translation.

       1mShow Resource Boxes0m
	       This entry expands the selected nodes  (see  next  section)  to
	       show  the  new widget and constraint resources.	This operation
	       may also be performed with the 4mResources(on)24m translation.

       1mHide Resource Boxes0m
	       This entry removes the  resource	 displays  from	 the  selected
	       nodes  (usually to conserve space).  This operation may also be
	       performed with the 4mResources(off)24m translation.

1mSELECT MENU0m
       Resources for a single  widget  class  can  be  displayed  by  clicking
       1mButton2  22mon	 the  corresponding  node,  or	by  adding  the node to the
       selection list with 1mButton1 22mand using the 1mShow Resource Boxes 22mentry  in
       the 1mView 22mmenu.  Since 1mButton1 22mactually toggles the selection state of a
       node, clicking on a selected node will cause it to be removed from  the
       selected list.

       Collections  of	nodes may also be selected through the various entries
       in the 1mSelect 22mmenu:

       1mUnselect All0m
	       This entry removes all nodes from  the  selection  list.	  This
	       operation  may  also  be	 performed  with  the  4mSelect(nothing)0m
	       translation.

       1mSelect All0m
	       This  entry  adds  all  nodes  to  the  selection  list.	  This
	       operation   may	 also	be   performed	with  the  4mSelect(all)0m
	       translation.

       1mInvert All0m
	       This entry adds unselected nodes to, and removes selected nodes
	       from, the selection list.  This operation may also be performed
	       with the 4mSelect(invert)24m translation.

       1mSelect Parent0m
	       This entry selects the immediate parents of all selected nodes.
	       This  operation	may  also be performed with the 4mSelect(parent)0m
	       translation.

       1mSelect Ancestors0m
	       This entry recursively selects  all  parents  of	 all  selected
	       nodes.	 This	operation  may	also  be  performed  with  the
	       4mSelect(ancestors)24m translation.

       1mSelect Children0m
	       This entry selects  the	immediate  children  of	 all  selected
	       nodes.	 This	operation  may	also  be  performed  with  the
	       4mSelect(children)24m translation.

       1mSelect Descendants0m
	       This entry recursively selects all  children  of	 all  selected
	       nodes.	 This	operation  may	also  be  performed  with  the
	       4mSelect(descendants)24m translation.

       1mSelect Has Resources0m
	       This entry selects all nodes that add new resources (regular or
	       constraint)   to	 their	corresponding  widget  classes.	  This
	       operation may also  be  performed  with	the  4mSelect(resources)0m
	       translation.

       1mSelect Shown Resource Boxes0m
	       This entry selects all nodes whose resource boxes are currently
	       expanded (usually so that they can be closed with 1mHide Resource0m
	       1mBoxes22m).    This  operation	may  also  be  performed  with	the
	       4mSelect(shown)24m translation.

1mACTIONS0m
       The following application actions are provided:

       1mQuit()0m
	       This action causes 4mviewres24m to exit.

       1mSetLabelType(4m22mtype24m1m)0m
	       This action sets the node labels to display the widget 4mvariable0m
	       or 4mclass24m names, according to the argument 4mtype24m.

       1mSetOrientation(4m22mdirection24m1m)0m
	       This  action  sets  the	root  of  the  tree  to	 be one of the
	       following areas of the window:  4mWest24m, 4mNorth24m, 4mEast24m, or 4mSouth24m.

       1mSelect(4m22mwhat24m1m)0m
	       This action selects the indicated nodes, as  described  in  the
	       1mVIEW  MENU  22msection:  4mnothing24m	(unselects  all	 nodes), 4minvert24m,
	       4mparent24m, 4mancestors24m, 4mchildren24m, 4mdescendants24m, 4mresources24m, 4mshown24m.

       1mResources(4m22mop24m1m)0m
	       This action turns 4mon24m, 4moff24m, or 4mtoggles24m the	 resource  boxes  for
	       the  selected  nodes.   If invoked from within one of the nodes
	       (through the keyboard or pointer), only that node is used.

X11PERF(1)							    X11PERF(1)



1mNAME0m
       x11perf - X11 server performance test program

1mSYNTAX0m
       1mx11perf 22m[ -option ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mx11perf24m program runs one or more performance tests and reports how
       fast an X server can execute the tests.

       Many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics  device  is  used  to
       display the output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the
       user gets his work done on some other device, like  a  terminal.	  Such
       benchmarks  usually  measure  drawing  speed for lines, polygons, text,
       etc.

       Since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but  as
       super-terminals, 4mx11perf24m measures window management performance as well
       as traditional graphics performance.  4mx11perf24m includes  benchmarks	for
       the  time  it  takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an
       application); to map a pre-existing set of windows onto the screen  (as
       when  you  deiconify an application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange
       windows (as when you slosh windows to and fro trying to	find  the  one
       you want).

       4mx11perf24m  also measures graphics performance for operations not normally
       used  in	 standalone  graphics  displays,  but  are  nonetheless	  used
       frequently  by X applications.  Such operations include CopyPlane (used
       to map bitmaps into pixels), scrolling  (used  in  text	windows),  and
       various	stipples  and  tiles  (used  for  CAD  and  color half-toning,
       respectively).

       4mx11perf24m should be used to analyze particular strengths  and	 weaknesses
       of  servers, and is most useful to a server writer who wants to analyze
       and improve a server.  4mx11perf24m is  meant  to  comprehensively  exercise
       just  about every X11 operation you can perform; it does not purport to
       be a representative sample of  the  operations  that  X11  applications
       actually	 use.  While it can be used as a benchmark, it was written and
       is intended as a performance testing tool.

       As such, 4mx11perf24m  DOES  NOT	 whittle  down	measurements  to  a  single
       ``HeXStones''  or  ``MeXops''  number.	We consider such numbers to be
       uninformative at best and misleading at worst.  Some servers which  are
       very  fast  for	certain	 applications can be very slow for others.  No
       single number or small set of numbers are  sufficient  to  characterize
       how  an X implementation will perform on all applications.  However, by
       knowledge of your favorite application, you may	be  able  to  use  the
       numbers	4mx11perf24m  reports  to  predict  its	 performance  on  a given X
       implementation.

       That said, you might also want to look at 4mx11perfcomp(1),24m a program	 to
       compare	the  outputs of different 4mx11perf24m runs.  You provide a list of
       files containing results from 4mx11perf,24m and it lays them out in  a  nice
       tabular format.

       For  repeatable results, 4mx11perf24m should be run using a local connection
       on a freshly-started server.  The default configuration runs each  test
       5  times,  in  order  to see if each trial takes approximately the same
       amount of time.	Strange glitches should be examined; if non-repeatable
       one  might chalk them up to daemons and network traffic.	 Each trial is
       run for 5 seconds, in order to reduce  random  time  differences.   The
       number  of  objects  processed per second is displayed to 3 significant
       digits, but you'll be lucky on most UNIX	 system	 if  the  numbers  are
       actually	 consistent  to 2 digits.  4mx11perf24m moves the cursor out of the
       test window; you should be careful not to bump the mouse	 and  move  it
       back into the window.  (A prize to people who correctly explain why!!).

       Before running a test, 4mx11perf24m determines what the round trip  time	 to
       the  server  is, and factors this out of the final timing reported.  It
       ensures that the server has actually performed the  work	 requested  by
       fetching	 a  pixel  back from the test window, which means that servers
       talking to graphics accelerators can't claim that they are done,	 while
       in the meantime the accelerator is painting madly.

       By  default  4mx11perf24m automatically calibrates the number of repetitions
       of each test, so that each should take approximately the same length of
       time  to run across servers of widely differing speeds.	However, since
       each test must be run to completion at least once,  some	 slow  servers
       may  take  a  very  long	 time,	particularly  on the window moving and
       resizing tests, and on the arc drawing tests.

       All timing reports are for the smallest object involved.	 For  example,
       the  line  tests use a PolyLine request to paint several lines at once,
       but report how many lines per second the server can paint, not how many
       PolyLine	 requests  per second.	Text tests paint a line of characters,
       but report on the number of characters per second.  Some	 window	 tests
       map,  unmap,  or	 move  a  single parent window, but report on how many
       children windows per second the server can map, unmap, or move.

       The current program is mostly the responsibility of Joel McCormack.  It
       is based upon the x11perf developed by Phil Karlton, Susan Angebranndt,
       Chris Kent,  Mary  Walker,  and	Todd  Newman,  who  wanted  to	assess
       performance  differences	 between  various servers.  Several tests were
       added  in order to write and tune the PMAX (DECStation  3100)  servers.
       For  a  general	release	 to  the  world, 4mx11perf24m was rewritten to ease
       making comparisons between  widely  varying  machines,  to  cover  most
       important  (and	unimportant) X functionality, and to exercise graphics
       operations  in  as  many	 different  orientations  and  alignments   as
       possible.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mx11perf24m is solely Xlib based, and accepts the options listed below:

       1m-display host:dpy0m
		     Specifies which display to use.

       1m-sync	       22mRuns the tests in synchronous mode.  Normally only useful
		     for debugging 4mx11perf24m 4m.0m

       1m-pack	       22mRuns rectangle tests so that they pack  rectangles  right
		     next  to  each other.  This makes it easy to debug server
		     code for stipples and tiles...if the pattern looks	 ugly,
		     you've got alignment problems.

       1m-repeat 4m22m<n>24m   Repeats	each test 4mn24m times (by default each test is run 5
		     times).

       1m-time 4m22m<s>24m     Specifies how long in seconds each  test	 should	 be  run
		     (default 5 seconds).

       1m-all	       22mRuns all tests.  This may take a while.

       1m-range 4m22m<test1>24m1m[,4m22m<test2>24m1m]0m
		     Runs all the tests starting from the specified name 4mtest10m
		     until the name 4mtest224m, including both the specified tests.
		     The  testnames should be one of the options starting from
		     -dot. (eg) -range line100 will peform the tests from  the
		     100 pixel line test, and go on till the last test, -range
		     line100,dline10  will  do	the  tests  from  line100   to
		     dline10.

       1m-labels       22mGenerates  just  the	descriptive  labels  for  each test
		     specified.	 See 4mx11perfcomp24m for more details.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor-or-pixel0m
		     Specifies the foreground color or pixel value to use.

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor-or-pixel0m
		     Specifies the background color or pixel value to use.

       1m-clips 4m22mdefault0m
		     Default number of clip windows.

       1m-ddbg 4m22mcolor-or-pixel0m
		     Specifies the color or pixel value to use for drawing the
		     odd  segments  of	a DoubleDashed line or arc.  This will
		     default to the bg color.

       1m-rop <rop0 rop1 ...>0m
		     Use specified  raster  ops	 (default  is  GXcopy).	  This
		     option  only  affects  graphics  benchmarks  in which the
		     graphics function is actually used.

       1m-pm <pm0 pm1 ...>0m
		     Use specified planemasks (default is  ~0).	  This	option
		     only  affects  graphics benchmarks in which the planemask
		     is actually used.

       1m-depth <depth>0m
		     Use a visual with <depth> planes per  pixel  (default  is
		     the default visual).

       1m-vclass <vclass>0m
		     Use  a  visual  with  of class <vclass>.  <vclass> can be
		     StaticGray,    GrayScale,	  StaticColor,	  PseudoColor,
		     TrueColor,	 or  DirectColor.   (default  is  the  default
		     visual).

       1m-reps <n>     22mSpecify the repetition  count	 (Default  is  number  that
		     takes aprox. 5 seconds)

       1m-subs <s0 s1 ...>0m

		     semantics.

       1m-v1.3	       22mPerform  only x11perf Version 1.3 tests using Version 1.3
		     semantics.

       1m-su	       22mSet the  save_under  window  attribute  to  True  on	all
		     windows created by x11perf.  Default is False.

       1m-bs <backing_store_hint>0m
		     Set the backing_store window attribute to the given value
		     on all windows created by	x11perf.  <backing_store_hint>

X11PERFCOMP(1)							X11PERFCOMP(1)



1mNAME0m
       x11perfcomp - X11 server performance comparison program

1mSYNTAX0m
       1mx11perfcomp 22m[ -r | -ro ] [ -l label_file ] files

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mx11perfcomp24m program merges the output of  several  4mx11perf(1)24m  runs
       into  a	nice tabular format.  It takes the results in each file, fills
       in any missing test results if necessary, and for each test  shows  the
       objects/second  rate  of	 each  server.	 If invoked with the -r or -ro
       options, it shows the relative performance of each server to the	 first
       server.

       Normally,  4mx11perfcomp24m uses the first file specified to determine which
       specific tests it should report on.  Some (non-DEC :) servers may  fail
       to   perform  all  tests.   In  this  case,  4mx11perfcomp24m  automatically
       substitutes in a rate of 0.0  objects/second.   Since  the  first  file
       determines  which tests to report on, this file must contain a superset
       of the tests reported in the other files, else 4mx11perfcomp24m will fail.

       You can provide an explicit list of tests to report on by using the  -l
       switch  to  specify  a  file of labels.	You can create a label file by
       using the -label option in 4mx11perf.0m

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mx11perfcomp24m accepts the options listed below:

       1m-r		 22mSpecifies that the output should also include  relative
		       server performance.

       1m-ro		 22mSpecifies  that the output should include only relative
		       server performance.

       1m-l label_file	 22mSpecifies a label file to use.

XAUTH(1)							      XAUTH(1)



1mNAME0m
       xauth - X authority file utility

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxauth 22m[ 1m-f 4m22mauthfile24m ] [ 1m-vqibn 22m] [ 4mcommand24m 4marg24m 4m...24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxauth24m program  is  used	 to  edit  and	display	 the  authorization
       information  used  in  connecting  to  the  X  server.  This program is
       usually used to extract authorization  records  from  one  machine  and
       merge  them  in	on another (as is the case when using remote logins or
       granting access to other users).	 Commands  (described  below)  may  be
       entered	interactively, on the 4mxauth24m command line, or in scripts.  Note
       that this program does  1mnot  22mcontact  the  X  server  except  when	the
       generate	 command  is  used.   Normally 4mxauth24m is not used to create the
       authority file entry in the first place; 4mxdm24m does that.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options may be  used  with	 4mxauth24m.   They  may  be  given
       individually (e.g., 4m-q24m 4m-i24m) or may combined (e.g., 4m-qi24m).

       1m-f 4m22mauthfile0m
	       This  option  specifies	the name of the authority file to use.
	       By default, 4mxauth24m will use the file specified by the XAUTHORITY
	       environment   variable	or  4m.Xauthority24m  in  the  user's  home
	       directory.

       1m-q	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxauth24m should operate quietly and not
	       print  unsolicited  status messages.  This is the default if an
	       4mxauth24m command is given on the command line or if  the  standard
	       output is not directed to a terminal.

       1m-v	 22mThis  option  indicates that 4mxauth24m should operate verbosely and
	       print  status  messages	indicating  the	 results  of   various
	       operations (e.g., how many records have been read in or written
	       out).  This is the default if 4mxauth24m is  reading  commands  from
	       its  standard  input  and  its standard output is directed to a
	       terminal.

       1m-i	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxauth24m should  ignore  any  authority
	       file  locks.   Normally,	 4mxauth24m will refuse to read or edit any
	       authority  files	 that  have  been  locked  by  other  programs
	       (usually 4mxdm24m or another 4mxauth24m).

       1m-b	 22mThis  option  indicates  that 4mxauth24m should attempt to break any
	       authority file locks before proceeding.	Use this  option  only
	       to clean up stale locks.

       1m-n	 22mThis  option indicates that 4mxauth24m should not attempt to resolve
	       any hostnames, but should simply always print the host  address
	       as stored in the authority file.

1mCOMMANDS0m
       The following commands may be used to manipulate authority files:

       1madd 4m22mdisplayname24m 4mprotocolname24m 4mhexkey0m
	       An  authorization  entry	 for  the  indicated display using the
	       given protocol and key data is added to the authorization file.
	       The data is specified as an even-lengthed string of hexadecimal
	       digits, each pair representing one octet.  The first  digit  of
	       each  pair  gives the most significant 4 bits of the octet, and
	       the second digit of the pair  gives  the	 least	significant  4
	       bits.   For  example,  a	 32 character hexkey would represent a
	       128-bit value.  A protocol name consisting  of  just  a	single
	       period is treated as an abbreviation for 4mMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-124m.


       1mgenerate 4m22mdisplayname24m 4mprotocolname24m [1mtrusted|untrusted22m]
	       [1mtimeout 4m22mseconds24m] [1mgroup 4m22mgroup-id24m] [1mdata 4m22mhexdata24m]

	       This  command  is  similar to add.  The main difference is that
	       instead of requiring the	 user  to  supply  the	key  data,  it
	       connects	 to  the  server specified in 4mdisplayname24m and uses the
	       SECURITY extension in order to get the key data to store in the
	       authorization file.  If the server cannot be contacted or if it
	       does not support the SECURITY  extension,  the  command	fails.
	       Otherwise,  an  authorization  entry  for the indicated display
	       using the given protocol is added to the authorization file.  A
	       protocol	 name consisting of just a single period is treated as
	       an abbreviation for 4mMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-124m.

	       If the 1mtrusted 22moption is used, clients that connect using  this
	       authorization  will have full run of the display, as usual.  If
	       1muntrusted  22mis   used,   clients   that   connect   using   this
	       authorization  will  be considered untrusted and prevented from
	       stealing or tampering with data belonging to  trusted  clients.
	       See  the	 SECURITY  extension specification for full details on
	       the restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.  The default  is
	       1muntrusted22m.

	       The   1mtimeout	 22moption  specifies  how  long  in  seconds  this
	       authorization will be  valid.   If  the	authorization  remains
	       unused  (no clients are connected with it) for longer than this
	       time period, the server purges the  authorization,  and	future
	       attempts	 to connect using it will fail.	 Note that the purging
	       done by the server does 1mnot 22mdelete the authorization entry from
	       the authorization file.	The default timeout is 60 seconds.

	       The  1mgroup  22moption specifies the application group that clients
	       connecting with this authorization should belong to.   See  the
	       application  group  extension  specification  for more details.
	       The default is to not belong to an application group.

	       The 1mdata 22moption specifies data that the server  should  use	 to
	       generate	 the  authorization.   Note  that this is 1mnot 22mthe same
	       data  that  gets	 written  to  the  authorization  file.	   The
	       interpretation  of  this	 data  depends	on  the	 authorization
	       protocol.  The 4mhexdata24m is in the  same  format  as	the  4mhexkey0m
	       described  in the add command.  The default is to send no data.


       1m[n]extract 4m22mfilename24m 4mdisplayname...0m
	       Authorization entries for each of the  specified	 displays  are
	       written	to  the	 indicated  file.   If the 4mnextract24m command is
	       used, the entries are written in a numeric format suitable  for
	       non-binary  transmission (such as secure electronic mail).  The
	       extracted entries can be read  back  in	using  the  4mmerge24m	and
	       4mnmerge24m  commands.	If  the	 filename consists of just a single
	       dash, the entries will be written to the standard output.

       1m[n]list 22m[4mdisplayname24m...]
	       Authorization entries for each of the  specified	 displays  (or
	       all  if	no  displays  are  named)  are printed on the standard
	       output.	If the 4mnlist24m command is used, entries will be shown in
	       the  numeric  format  used  by the 4mnextract24m command; otherwise,
	       they are shown  in  a  textual  format.	 Key  data  is	always
	       displayed in the hexadecimal format given in the description of
	       the 4madd24m command.

       1m[n]merge 22m[4mfilename24m...]
	       Authorization entries are read from the specified files and are
	       merged	into   the  authorization  database,  superceding  any
	       matching existing entries. If the 4mnmerge24m command is	 used,	the
	       numeric	format given in the description of the 4mextract24m command
	       is used.	 If a filename consists of just	 a  single  dash,  the
	       standard input will be read if it hasn't been read before.

       1mremove 4m22mdisplayname24m...
	       Authorization  entries  matching	 the  specified	 displays  are
	       removed from the authority file.

       1msource 4m22mfilename0m
	       The specified file is treated  as  a  script  containing	 4mxauth0m
	       commands	 to  execute.	Blank lines and lines beginning with a
	       sharp sign (#) are ignored.  A  single  dash  may  be  used  to
	       indicate the standard input, if it hasn't already been read.

       1minfo	 22mInformation	 describing  the authorization file, whether or not
	       any changes have been made, and from where 4mxauth24m  commands	are
	       being read is printed on the standard output.

       1mexit	 22mIf	any  modifications  have  been	made, the authority file is
	       written out (if allowed), and the program  exits.   An  end  of
	       file is treated as an implicit 4mexit24m command.

       1mquit	 22mThe	 program  exits, ignoring any modifications.  This may also
	       be accomplished by pressing the interrupt character.

       1mhelp [4m22mstring24m1m]0m
	       A description of all commands that begin with the given	string
	       (or  all	 commands  if  no  string  is given) is printed on the
	       standard output.

       1m?	 22mA short list of the valid commands is printed on  the  standard
	       output.

1mDISPLAY NAMES0m
       Display	names  for  the 4madd24m, 4m[n]extract24m, 4m[n]list24m, 4m[n]merge24m, and 4mremove0m
       commands use the same format as the DISPLAY  environment	 variable  and
       the   common   4m-display24m   command	line   argument.   Display-specific
       information (such as the screen number)	is  unnecessary	 and  will  be
       ignored.	  Same-machine connections (such as local-host sockets, shared
       memory, and the Internet Protocol hostname 4mlocalhost24m) are  referred	 to
       as  4mhostname24m/unix:4mdisplaynumber24m  so  that  local  entries for different
       machines may be stored in one authority file.

1mEXAMPLE0m
       The most common use for 4mxauth24m is to extract the entry for  the  current
       display,	 copy  it  to  another	machine,  and merge it into the user's
       authority file on the remote machine:

	       %  xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh otherhost xauth merge -


       The following command contacts the server :0 to create an authorization
       using  the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 protocol.	Clients that connect with this
       authorization will be untrusted.
	    %  xauth generate :0 .

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       This 4mxauth24m program uses the following environment variables:

       1mXAUTHORITY0m
	       to get the name of the authority file to use if the  4m-f24m  option
	       isn't used.

       1mHOME	 22mto get the user's home directory if XAUTHORITY isn't defined.

1mFILES0m
       4m$HOME/.Xauthority0m
	       default authority file if XAUTHORITY isn't defined.

1mBUGS0m
       Users  that  have  unsecure  networks should take care to use encrypted
       file  transfer  mechanisms  to  copy  authorization   entries   between
       machines.   Similarly,  the  4mMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-124m  protocol  is  not very
       useful  in  unsecure  environments.   Sites  that  are  interested   in
       additional  security may need to use encrypted authorization mechanisms
       such as Kerberos.

       Spaces are currently not allowed in the protocol name.	Quoting	 could
       be added for the truly perverse.

XBIFF(1)							      XBIFF(1)



1mNAME0m
       xbiff - mailbox flag for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxbiff 22m[ -4mtoolkitoption24m ... ] [ 4m-option24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxbiff24m program displays a little image of a mailbox.  When there is
       no mail, the flag on the mailbox is down.  When mail arrives, the  flag
       goes  up	 and the mailbox beeps.	 By default, pressing any mouse button
       in the image forces 4mxbiff24m to remember the current size of the mail file
       as being the ``empty'' size and to lower the flag.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXbiff24m  accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along
       with the additional options listed below:

       1m-help	 22mThis option indicates that	a  brief  summary  of  the  allowed
	       options should be printed on the standard error.

       1m-update 4m22mseconds0m
	       This  option  specifies the frequency in seconds at which 4mxbiff0m
	       should update its display.  If the mailbox is obscured and then
	       exposed,	 it  will  be  updated immediately.  The default is 30
	       seconds.

       1m-file 4m22mfilename0m
	       This option specifies the name of  the  file  which  should  be
	       monitored.   By	default	 it  watches your inbox in the default
	       location for your system (some examples are /var/mail/4musername24m,
	       /usr/spool/mail/4musername24m,	 /var/spool/mail/4musername24m	  (where
	       4musername24m is your login name).  If the MAIL environment variable
	       is set, the file specified by it will be monitored.

       1m-volume 4m22mpercentage0m
	       This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when new
	       mail comes in.

       1m-shape	 22mThis option indicates that the mailbox window should be  shaped
	       if masks for the empty or full images are given.

       The  following  standard	 X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly
       used with 4mxbiff:0m

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the X server to contact.

       1m-geometry 4m22mgeometry0m
	       This option specifies the preferred size and  position  of  the
	       mailbox	window.	  The  mailbox is 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels
	       high and will be centered in the window.

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color to use for  the	background  of
	       the window.

       1m-bd 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the border of the
	       window.

       1m-bw 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option  specifies  the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding the window.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the foreground of
	       the window.

       1m-rv	 22mThis option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
	       swapping the foreground and background colors.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       This  option  specifies	a resource string to be used.  This is
	       especially useful  for  setting	resources  that	 do  not  have
	       separate command line options.

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       The  application	 class	name  is XBiff.	 This program uses the 4mMailbox0m
       widget.	It understands all of the core resource names and  classes  as
       well as:


       1mcheckCommand (22mclass 1mCheckCommand)0m
	       Specifies  a shell command to be executed to check for new mail
	       rather than examining the size of 1mfile22m.  The  specified  string
	       value  is  used	as  the	 argument  to a 4msystem24m(3) call and may
	       therefore  contain  i/o	redirection.   An  exit	 status	 of  0
	       indicates  that new mail is waiting, 1 indicates that there has
	       been no change in size, and 2 indicates that the mail has  been
	       cleared.	 By default, no shell command is provided.

       1mfile (22mclass 1mFile)0m
	       Specifies  the  name of the file to monitor.  The default is as
	       described above for the 1m-file 22mcommand line option.

       1monceOnly (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies that the bell is only rung the first time new mail is
	       found  and  is  not  rung again until at least one interval has
	       passed with no mail  waiting.   The  window  will  continue  to
	       indicate	 the presence of new mail until it has been retrieved.
	       The default is false.

       1mwidth (22mclass 1mWidth)0m
	       Specifies the width of the mailbox.

       1mheight (22mclass 1mHeight)0m
	       Specifies the height of the mailbox.

       1mupdate (22mclass 1mInterval)0m
	       Specifies the frequency in seconds at which the mail should  be
	       checked.	 The default is 30.

       1mvolume (22mclass 1mVolume)0m
	       Specifies  how loud the bell should be rung.  The default is 33
	       percent.

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies the color for the foreground.

       1mreverseVideo (22mclass 1mReverseVideo)0m
	       Specifies  that	the  foreground	 and  background   should   be
	       reversed.

       1mflip (22mclass 1mFlip)0m
	       Specifies  whether or not the image that is shown when mail has
	       arrived should be inverted.  The default is ``true.''

       1mfullPixmap (22mclass 1mPixmap)0m
	       Specifies a bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived.   The
	       default is flagup.

       1memptyPixmap (22mclass 1mPixmap)0m
	       Specifies  a  bitmap  to	 be shown when no new mail is present.
	       The default is flagdown.

       1mshapeWindow (22mclass 1mShapeWindow)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the mailbox window should be shaped to
	       the  given  fullPixmapMask and emptyPixmapMask.	The default is
	       false.

       1mfullPixmapMask (22mclass 1mPixmapMask)0m
	       Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when new  mail  has
	       arrived.	 The default is none.

       1memptyPixmapMask (22mclass 1mPixmapMask)0m
	       Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when no new mail is
	       present.	 The default is none.

1mACTIONS0m
       The 4mMailbox24m widget provides the following  actions	for  use  in  event
       translations:

       1mcheck() 22mThis action causes the widget to check for new mail and display
	       the flag appropriately.

       1munset() 22mThis action causes the widget to lower the flag until new  mail
	       comes in.

       1mset()	 22mThis  action causes the widget to raise the flag until the user
	       resets it.

       The default translation is

	       <ButtonPress>:  unset()


1mENVIRONMENT0m
       1mDISPLAY 22mto get the default host and display number.

       1mXENVIRONMENT0m

XCALC(1)							      XCALC(1)



1mNAME0m
       xcalc - scientific calculator for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxcalc 22m[-stipple] [-rpn] [-4mtoolkitoption...24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mxcalc24m  is  a scientific calculator desktop accessory that can emulate a
       TI-30 or an HP-10C.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mxcalc24m accepts all of the standard toolkit command  line  options  along
       with two additional options:


       1m-stipple0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  the background of the calculator
	       should  be  drawn  using	 a  stipple  of	 the  foreground   and
	       background   colors.    On  monochrome  displays	 improves  the
	       appearance.


       1m-rpn	 22mThis option indicates that Reverse Polish  Notation	 should	 be
	       used.  In this mode the calculator will look and behave like an
	       HP-10C.	Without this flag, it will emulate a TI-30.

1mOPERATION0m
       4mPointer24m 4mUsage:24m Operations may be performed with pointer button 1, or in
       some  cases, with the keyboard.	Many common calculator operations have
       keyboard accelerators.  To quit, press pointer button 3 on the  AC  key
       of the TI calculator, or the ON key of the HP calculator.

       4mCalculator24m 4mKey24m 4mUsage24m 4m(TI24m 4mmode):24m The numbered keys, the +/- key, and the
       +, -, *, /, and = keys all do exactly what you would  expect  them  to.
       It  should  be  noted  that  the	 operators  obey the standard rules of
       precedence.  Thus, entering "3+4*5=" results in "23",  not  "35".   The
       parentheses   can   be	used   to   override   this.	For   example,
       "(1+2+3)*(4+5+6)=" results in "6*15=90".

       The entire number in the calculator display can be selected,  in	 order
       to paste the result of a calculation into text.

       The  action  procedures	associated with each function are given below.
       These are useful if you are interested in defining a custom calculator.
       The  action  used  for  all  digit  keys	 is  1mdigit(4m22mn24m1m)22m,  where 4mn24m is the
       corresponding digit, 0..9.

       1m1/x	   22mReplaces the number in the display with its reciprocal.	The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mreciprocal()22m.

       1mx^2	   22mSquares  the number in the display.  The corresponding action
		 procedure is 1msquare()22m.

       1mSQRT	   22mTakes the square root of the  number  in	the  display.	The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1msquareRoot()22m.

       1mCE/C	   22mWhen  pressed  once, clears the number in the display without
		 clearing the state of the machine.  Allows you to re-enter  a
		 number	 if  you make a mistake.  Pressing it twice clears the
		 state, also.  The corresponding action procedure for TI  mode
		 is 1mclear()22m.

       1mAC	   22mClears  the  display, the state, and the memory.	Pressing it
		 with the third pointer button turns off  the  calculator,  in
		 that it exits the program.  The action procedure to clear the
		 state is 1moff()22m; to quit, 1mquit()22m.

       1mINV	   22mInvert  function.	  See  the  individual	function  keys	for
		 details.  The corresponding action procedure is 1minverse()22m.

       1msin	   22mComputes	 the   sine  of	 the  number  in  the  display,	 as
		 interpreted by the current DRG mode  (see  DRG,  below).   If
		 inverted,  it computes the arcsine.  The corresponding action
		 procedure is 1msine()22m.

       1mcos	   22mComputes	the  cosine,  or  arccosine  when  inverted.	The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mcosine()22m.

       1mtan	   22mComputes	the  tangent,  or  arctangent  when  inverted.	The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mtangent()22m.

       1mDRG	   22mChanges the DRG mode, as indicated by 'DEG', 'RAD', or 'GRAD'
		 at  the  bottom  of  of  the  calculator  ``liquid  crystal''
		 display.  When in 'DEG' mode,	numbers	 in  the  display  are
		 taken	as  being  degrees.   In  'RAD'	 mode,	numbers are in
		 radians, and in 'GRAD' mode,  numbers	are  in	 grads.	  When
		 inverted,  the DRG key has a feature of converting degrees to
		 radians  to  grads  and  vice-versa.	 Example:    put   the
		 calculator  into  'DEG'  mode,	 and  enter "45 INV DRG".  The
		 display  should  now  show  something	along  the  lines   of
		 ".785398",  which  is	45  degrees converted to radians.  The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mdegree()22m.

       1me	   22mThe constant 'e'.	 (2.7182818...).  The corresponding  action
		 procedure is 1me()22m.

       1mEE	   22mUsed  for	 entering exponential numbers.	For example, to get
		 "-2.3E-4"  you'd  enter  "2  .	 3  +/-	 EE   4	  +/-".	   The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mscientific()22m.

       1mlog	   22mCalculates  the  log  (base 10) of the number in the display.
		 When inverted, it raises "10.0" to the number in the display.
		 For  example,	entering  "3 INV log" should result in "1000".
		 The corresponding action procedure is 1mlogarithm()22m.

       1mln	   22mCalculates the log (base e) of the  number  in  the  display.
		 When  inverted,  it  raises "e" to the number in the display.
		 For example, entering "e  ln"	should	result	in  "1".   The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mnaturalLog()22m.

       1my^x	   22mRaises  the  number on the left to the power of the number on
		 the right.  For example "2 y^x 3 =" results in "8", which  is
		 2^3.	For a further example, "(1+2+3) y^x (1+2) =" equals "6
		 y^x  3"  which	 equals	 "216".	  The	corresponding	action
		 procedure is 1mpower()22m.

       1mPI	   22mThe constant 'pi'.  (3.1415927....)  The corresponding action
		 procedure is 1mpi()22m.

       1mx!	   22mComputes the factorial of the number  in	the  display.	The
		 number	 in the display must be an integer in the range 0-500,
		 though, depending on your math	 library,  it  might  overflow
		 long  before  that.   The  corresponding  action procedure is
		 1mfactorial()22m.

       1m(	   22mLeft parenthesis.	 The corresponding action procedure for	 TI
		 calculators is 1mleftParen()22m.

       1m)	   22mRight parenthesis.  The corresponding action procedure for TI
		 calculators is 1mrightParen()22m.

       1m/	   22mDivision.	 The corresponding action procedure is 1mdivide()22m.

       1m*	   22mMultiplication.	The  corresponding  action   procedure	 is
		 1mmultiply()22m.

       1m-	   22mSubtraction.    The   corresponding   action   procedure	 is
		 1msubtract()22m.

       1m+	   22mAddition.	 The corresponding action procedure is 1madd()22m.

       1m=	   22mPerform calculation.  The	 TI-specific  action  procedure	 is
		 1mequal()22m.

       1mSTO	   22mCopies the number in the display to the memory location.	The
		 corresponding action procedure is 1mstore()22m.

       1mRCL	   22mCopies the number from the memory location  to  the  display.
		 The corresponding action procedure is 1mrecall()22m.

       1mSUM	   22mAdds  the	 number	 in the display to the number in the memory
		 location.  The corresponding action procedure is 1msum()22m.

       1mEXC	   22mSwaps the number in the display with the number in the memory
		 location.   The  corresponding	 action	 procedure  for the TI
		 calculator is 1mexchange()22m.

       1m+/-	   22mNegate; change sign.  The corresponding action  procedure	 is
		 1mnegate()22m.

       1m.	   22mDecimal point.  The action procedure is 1mdecimal()22m.


       4mCalculator24m 4mKey24m 4mUsage24m 4m(RPN24m 4mmode):24m The number keys, CHS (change sign), +,
       -, *, /, and ENTR keys all do exactly what you would expect them to do.
       Many of the remaining keys are the same as in TI mode.  The differences
       are detailed below.  The action procedure for the ENTR key is  1menter()22m.


       1m<-	   22mThis  is	a  backspace  key  that	 can  be used if you make a
		 mistake while entering a number.  It will erase  digits  from
		 the display.  (See BUGS).  Inverse backspace will clear the X
		 register.  The corresponding action procedure is 1mback()22m.

       1mON	   22mClears the display, the state, and the memory.   Pressing	 it
		 with  the  third  pointer button turns off the calculator, in
		 that it exits	the  program.	To  clear  state,  the	action
		 procedure is 1moff22m; to quit, 1mquit()22m.

       1mINV	   22mInverts  the meaning of the function keys.  This would be the
		 4mf24m key on	an  HP	calculator,  but  4mxcalc24m  does  not	 display
		 multiple  legends  on	each key.  See the individual function
		 keys for details.

       1m10^x	   22mRaises "10.0" to the number in the top of	 the  stack.   When
		 inverted,  it	calculates  the log (base 10) of the number in
		 the  display.	 The   corresponding   action	procedure   is
		 1mtenpower()22m.

       1me^x	   22mRaises  "e"  to  the  number  in	the top of the stack.  When
		 inverted, it calculates the log (base e) of the number in the
		 display.  The action procedure is 1mepower()22m.

       1mSTO	   22mCopies  the  number  in  the  top	 of  the  stack to a memory
		 location.  There are 10 memory locations.  The desired memory
		 is specified by following this key with a digit key.

       1mRCL	   22mPushes the number from the specified memory location onto the
		 stack.

       1mSUM	   22mAdds the number on top of the stack  to  the  number  in	the
		 specified memory location.

       1mx:y	   22mExchanges	 the  numbers in the top two stack positions, the X
		 and Y	registers.   The  corresponding	 action	 procedure  is
		 1mXexchangeY()22m.

       1mR v	   22mRolls  the stack downward.  When inverted, it rolls the stack
		 upward.  The corresponding action procedure is 1mroll()22m.

       4mblank24m     These keys were used for programming functions on the HP-10C.
		 Their functionality has not been duplicated in 4mxcalc24m.

       Finally,	 there	are  two  additional  action procedures: 1mbell()22m, which
       rings the bell; and 1mselection()22m, which performs a  cut  on	the  entire
       number in the calculator's ``liquid crystal'' display.

1mACCELERATORS0m
       Accelerators  are shortcuts for entering commands.  4mxcalc24m provides some
       sample keyboard accelerators; also users	 can  customize	 accelerators.
       The numeric keypad accelerators provided by 4mxcalc24m should be intuitively
       correct.	 The accelerators defined by 4mxcalc24m on the	main  keyboard	are
       given below:

1mCUSTOMIZATION0m
       The application class name is XCalc.

       4mxcalc24m  has	an  enormous  application defaults file which specifies the
       position, label, and function of each key on the calculator.   It  also
       gives  translations  to	serve as keyboard accelerators.	 Because these
       resources are not specified in  the  source  code,  you	can  create  a
       customized  calculator  by writing a private application defaults file,
       using the Athena Command and Form widget resources to specify the  size
       and position of buttons, the label for each button, and the function of
       each button.

       The foreground and background colors of	each  calculator  key  can  be
       individually  specified.	  For  the  TI	calculator,  a classical color
       resource specification might be:

       XCalc.ti.Command.background:  gray50
       XCalc.ti.Command.foreground:  white

       For each of buttons 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40, specify:
       XCalc.ti.button20.background: black
       XCalc.ti.button20.foreground: white

       For each of buttons 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, and 39:
       XCalc.ti.button22.background: white
       XCalc.ti.button22.foreground: black

1mWIDGET HIERARCHY0m
       In  order  to  specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
       the widgets which compose 4mxcalc24m.  In the  notation	below,	indentation
       indicates  hierarchical	structure.   The  widget  class	 name is given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.

       1mstipple 22m(Class 1mStipple22m)
	       Indicates  that the background should be stippled.  The default
	       is ``on''  for  monochrome  displays,  and  ``off''  for	 color
	       displays.

       1mcursor 22m(Class 1mCursor22m)
	       The  name  of  the  symbol  used to represent the pointer.  The
	       default is ``hand2''.

1mCOLORS0m
       If you would like xcalc to use its ti colors, include the following  in
       the #ifdef COLOR section of the file you read with xrdb:

       *customization:		       -color

       This  will  cause xcalc to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
       customization file: 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XCalc-color24m.

XCLIPBOARD(1)							 XCLIPBOARD(1)



1mNAME0m
       xclipboard - X clipboard client

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxclipboard 22m[ 4m-toolkitoption24m ... ] [ 1m-w 22m] [ 1m-nw 22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxclipboard24m  program is used to collect and display text selections
       that are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients.	 It is typically  used
       to  save	 CLIPBOARD selections for later use.  It stores each CLIPBOARD
       selection as a separate string, each of which can  be  selected.	  Each
       time CLIPBOARD is asserted by another application, 4mxclipboard24m transfers
       the contents of that selection to a new buffer and displays it  in  the
       text  window.   Buffers are never automatically deleted, so you'll want
       to use the delete button to get rid of useless items.

       Since 4mxclipboard24m uses a Text Widget to  display  the  contents  of	the
       clipboard,  text	 sent  to  the CLIPBOARD may be re-selected for use in
       other applications.  4mxclipboard24m  also  responds  to	 requests  for	the
       CLIPBOARD  selection  from other clients by sending the entire contents
       of the currently displayed buffer.

       An 4mxclipboard24m window has the following buttons across the top:

       4mquit24m    When this button is pressed, 4mxclipboard24m exits.

       4mdelete24m  When this button is pressed, the current buffer is deleted	and
	       the next one displayed.

       4mnew24m	    Creates  a new buffer with no contents.  Useful in constructing
	       a new CLIPBOARD selection by hand.

       4msave24m    Displays a File Save dialog box.  Pressing	the  Accept  button
	       saves  the  currently displayed buffer to the file specified in
	       the text field.

       4mnext24m    Displays the next buffer in the list.

       4mprevious0m
	       Displays the previous buffer.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The 4mxclipboard24m program accepts all of the standard	X  Toolkit  command
       line options as well as the following:

       1m-w	 22mThis  option  indicates that lines of text that are too long to
	       be displayed on one line in the clipboard should wrap around to
	       the following lines.

       1m-nw	 22mThis  option  indicates that long lines of text should not wrap
	       around.	This is the default behavior.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know  the	 hierarchy  of
       the   widgets   which  compose  4mxclipboard24m.	  In  the  notation  below,
       indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is
       given first, followed by the widget instance name.

1mSENDING/RETRIEVING CLIPBOARD CONTENTS0m
       Text  is copied to the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of
       the 1mCLIPBOARD 22mselection.  Text is copied from the clipboard whenever  a
       client  requests	 the contents of the 1mCLIPBOARD 22mselection.	Examples of
       event  bindings	that  a	 user  may  wish  to  include  in  a  resource
       configuration file to use the clipboard are:

       *VT100.Translations: #override \
	    <Btn3Up>:		     select-end(CLIPBOARD) \n\

       xclock - analog / digital clock for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxclock	 22m[  1m-help 22m] [ 1m-analog 22m] [ 1m-digital 22m] [ 1m-brief 22m] [ 1m-chime 22m] [ 1m-hd0m

       ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxclock24m program displays the time in analog or  digital	form.	The
       time  is	 continuously updated at a frequency which may be specified by
       the user.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXclock24m accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along
       with the additional options listed below:

       1m-help	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  a  brief  summary of the allowed
	       options should be printed on the standard error.

       1m-analog 22mThis option indicates that a conventional 12  hour	clock  face
	       with tick marks and hands should be used.  This is the default.

       1m-digital 22mor 1m-d0m
	       This option indicates that a 24 hour digital  clock  should  be
	       used.

       1m-brief	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the	digital	 clock	should only
	       display the hours and minutes fields.  The default is  to  show
	       the full time and date information.

       1m-utime 22mor 1m-d0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  a	 digital  clock should display
	       seconds since the Epoch (in  format  '970012340	seconds	 since
	       Epoch' instead of a standard 24-hour time.

       1m-strftime 4m22mformat0m
	       This option allows an strftime(3) format string to be specified
	       for the digital clock's display.

       1m-twelve 22mThis option indicates that a digital clock should  display	the
	       time in twelve hour format.

       1m-twentyfour0m
	       This  option  indicates that a digital clock should display the
	       time in twenty-four hour format.	 This is the  default  when  a
	       digital clock is used.

       1m-chime	 22mThis  option  indicates that the clock should chime once on the
	       half hour and twice on the hour.

       1m-hands 4m22mcolor24m (or 1m-hd 4m22mcolor24m)
	       This option specifies the color	of  the	 hands	on  an	analog
	       clock.	The  default  is  4mblack24m.	This  option is effectively
	       ignored when Xrender is in use.

       1m-highlight 4m22mcolor24m (or 1m-hl 4m22mcolor24m)
	       This option specifies the color of the edges of the hands on an
	       analog  clock,  and  is	only  useful  on  color displays.  The
	       default is 4mblack24m.  This  option  is	 effectively  ignored  when
	       Xrender is in use.

       1m-update 4m22mseconds0m
	       This  option specifies the frequency in seconds at which 4mxclock0m
	       should update its display.  If the clock is obscured  and  then
	       exposed, it will be updated immediately.	 A value of 30 seconds
	       or less will enable a second hand  on  an  analog  clock.   The
	       default is 60 seconds.

       1m-padding 4m22mnumber0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  width  in	pixels	of the padding
	       between the window border  and  clock  text  or	picture.   The
	       default is 10 on a digital clock and 8 on an analog clock.

       1m-render 22mThis  option  tells 4mxclock24m to use the Xrender extension to draw
	       an anti-aliased face. This is the default if  4mxclock24m  has  been
	       compiled	 with  Xrender support.	 Note that the color selection
	       options and resources used when Xrender	is  in	effect	differ
	       from the standard options.

       1m-norender0m
	       This option turns off the use of Xrender to draw the clock.

       1m-sharp	 22mThis  option tells 4mxclock24m to use sharper edges when drawn using
	       the Xrender extension.

       1m-face 4m22mpattern0m
	       This option specifies the font to use in digital mode when  the
	       Xrender extension is used.

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       This  program  uses  the	 4mClock24m widget.  It understands all of the core
       resource names and classes as well as:


       1mwidth (22mclass 1mWidth)0m
	       Specifies the width of  the  clock.   The  default  for	analog
	       clocks  is  164	pixels;	 the  default  for  digital  clocks is
	       whatever is needed to hold the  clock  when  displayed  in  the
	       chosen font.

       1mheight (22mclass 1mHeight)0m
	       Specifies  the  height  of  the	clock.	The default for analog
	       clocks is  164  pixels;	the  default  for  digital  clocks  is
	       whatever	 is  needed  to	 hold  the clock when displayed in the
	       chosen font.

       1mupdate (22mclass 1mInterval)0m
	       Specifies the frequency in seconds at which the time should  be
	       redisplayed.

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies  the color for the tick marks. The default depends on
	       whether	4mreverseVideo24m  is  specified.    If	  4mreverseVideo24m   is
	       specified  the  default	is  4mlwhite24m,  otherwise  the default is
	       4mblack24m.


       1mhands (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies the color of the insides of the  clock's  hands.  The
	       default	depends	 on  whether  4mreverseVideo24m	 is  specified.	 If
	       4mreverseVideo24m is specified the default is 4mlwhite24m, otherwise  the
	       default	is  4mblack24m.	  Note	that this resource is not used when
	       Xrender is in effect.

       1mhighlight (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies the color used to highlight the  clock's  hands.  The
	       default is
		depends on whether 4mreverseVideo24m is specified.  If 4mreverseVideo0m
	       is specified the default is 4mlwhite24m, otherwise  the	default	 is
	       4mblack24m.   Note that this resource is not used when Xrender is in
	       effect.

       1manalog (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies whether or not an analog clock should be used instead
	       of a digital one.  The default is True.

       1mtwentyfour (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  a digital clock should display the
	       time in twenty-four hour format.	 The default is True.

       1mchime (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies whether or not a bell should be rung on the hour  and
	       half hour.

       1mpadding (22mclass 1mMargin)0m
	       Specifies  the amount of internal padding in pixels to be used.
	       The default is 8.

       1mfont (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies the font to be used for the digital clock.  Note that
	       variable	  width	  fonts	 currently  will  not  always  display
	       correctly.  This font is only  used  when  Xrender  is  not  in
	       effect.

       1mrender (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or not the Xrender extension should be used
	       for the display.	 The  default  is  True	 if  4mxclock24m  has  been
	       compiled with Xrender support.

       When  Xrender  is  in  effect,  the  following additional resources are
       understood:


       1mface (22mclass 1mFaceName)0m
	       Specify the pattern for the font to be  used  for  the  digital
	       clock when Xrender is used.

       1msharp (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies  if  sharp  edges  should  be used when rendering the
	       clock.  The default is False.

       1mbuffer (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       Specifies that the updates of the image are drawn to  a	pixmap
	       before  copied  into  the  window instead drawing them into the
	       window directly.

       The defaults  of	 the  following	 color	resources  depend  on  whether
       4mreverseVideo24m is specified.	If 4mreverseVideo24m is specified the default is
       4mlwhite24m, otherwise the default is 4mblack24m.

       1mhourColor (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       The color of the hour hand.

       1mminuteColor (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       The color of the minute hand.

       1msecondColor (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       The color of the second hand.

       1mmajorColor (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       The color of the major scale ticks (i. e. each five minutes).

       1mminorColor (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       The color of the minor scale ticks (between major ticks).

XCMSDB(1)							     XCMSDB(1)



1mNAME0m
       xcmsdb - Device Color Characterization utility for X  Color  Management
       System

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxcmsdb 22m[ 1m-query 22m] [ 1m-remove 22m] [ 1m-format 3222m|1m1622m|1m8 22m] [ 4mfilename24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mxcmsdb24m  is used to load, query, or remove Device Color Characterization
       data stored in properties on the root window of the screen as specified
       in  section  7,	Device	Color  Characterization, of the ICCCM.	Device
       Color Characterization data (also called	 the  Device  Profile)	is  an
       integral part of Xlib's X Color Management System (Xcms), necessary for
       proper conversion of color specification between device-independent and
       device-dependent	  forms.    Xcms  uses	3x3  matrices  stored  in  the
       XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_MATRICES  property  to	convert	 color	specifications
       between	CIEXYZ and RGB Intensity (XcmsRGBi, also referred to as linear
       RGB).   Xcms  then  uses	 display  gamma	 information  stored  in   the
       XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_CORRECTION  property  to  convert color specifications
       between RGBi and RGB device (XcmsRGB, also referred to as device	 RGB).

       Note  that Xcms allows clients to register 4mfunction24m 4msets24m in addition to
       its built-in function set for CRT color monitors.  Additional  function
       sets  may store their device profile information in other properties in
       function set specific format.  This utility is unaware  of  these  non-
       standard properties.

       The  ASCII  readable  contents of 4mfilename24m (or the standard input if no
       input file is given)  are  appropriately	 transformed  for  storage  in
       properties, provided the 1m-query 22mor 1m-remove 22moptions are not specified.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mxcmsdb24m program accepts the following options:

       1m-query	 22mThis  option  attempts  to	read  the  XDCCC properties off the
	       screen's root window.  If successful, it	 transforms  the  data
	       into  a	more  readable format, then sends the data to standard
	       out.

       1m-remove 22mThis option attempts to remove  the	 XDCCC	properties  on	the
	       screen's root window.

       1m-format 3222m|1m1622m|1m80m
	       Specifies the property format (32, 16, or 8 bits per entry) for
	       the XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_CORRECTION property.  Precision of encoded
	       floating	 point	values increases with the increase in bits per
	       entry.  The default is 32 bits per entry.

XCONSOLE(1)							   XCONSOLE(1)



1mNAME0m
       xconsole - monitor system console messages with X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxconsole    22m[-4mtoolkitoption24m	...]	[-file	  4mfile-name24m]   [-notify]
       [-stripNonprint] [-daemon] [-verbose] [-exitOnFail]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxconsole24m program  displays  messages  which  are  usually  sent	 to
       /dev/console.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXconsole24m  accepts  all  of	the standard X Toolkit command line options
       along with the additional options listed below:

       1m-file 4m22mfile-name0m
	       To monitor some other device, use this option  to  specify  the
	       device  name.   This does not work on regular files as they are
	       always ready to be read from.

       1m-notify -nonotify0m
	       When new data are received from	the  console  and  the	notify
	       option  is  set,	 the  icon  name  of  the application has " *"
	       appended, so that it is evident even when  the  application  is
	       iconified.  -notify is the default.

       1m-daemon 22mThis  option causes 4mxconsole24m to place itself in the background,
	       using fork/exit.

       1m-verbose0m
	       When  set,  this	 option	 directs  4mxconsole24m	  to   display	 an
	       informative message in the first line of the text buffer.

       1m-exitOnFail0m
	       When  set,  this	 option	 directs  4mxconsole24m	 to exit when it is
	       unable to redirect the console output.

       1m-saveLines 4m22mcount0m
	       When set,  4mxconsole24m	 only  preserves  4mcount24m  lines  of	 message
	       history	instead	 of  growing  the text buffer without bound (a
	       4mcount24m of zero - the default - is treated as placing no limit on
	       the history).

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       This program uses the 4mAthena24m 4mText24m widget, look in the 4mAthena24m 4mWidget24m 4mSet0m
       documentation for controlling it.

       4mXconsole24m otherwise accepts resources of the same names as the  command-
       line  options  (without	the  leading  dash).  "file" is a string type,
       "saveLines" an integer, and the remaining options are booleans.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know  the	 hierarchy  of
       the widgets which compose 4mxconsole24m.	 In the notation below, indentation
       indicates hierarchical structure.   The	widget	class  name  is	 given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.

XCURSORGEN(1)							 XCURSORGEN(1)



1mNAME0m
       xcursorgen - create an X cursor file from a collection of PNG images

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxcursorgen 22m[4mconfig-file24m] [4moutput-file24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Xcursorgen reads the config-file to find	 the  list  of	cursor	images
       along  with  their  hotspot  and	 nominal size information.  Xcursorgen
       converts all of the images to Xcursor format and	 writes	 them  to  the
       output-file.

       Each line in the config file is of the form:
       <size> <xhot> <yhot> <filename> <ms-delay>

       Multiple	 images	 with  the  same  <size>  are  used to create animated
       cursors, the <ms-delay> value on each  line  indicates  how  long  each
       image should be displayed before switching to the next.	<ms-delay> can
       be elided for static cursors.

XCUTSEL(1)							    XCUTSEL(1)



1mNAME0m
       xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and selection

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxcutsel  22m[	4m-toolkitoption24m  ...]  [-selection	4mselection24m]	  [-cutbuffer
       4mnumber24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxcutsel24m  program  is used to copy the current selection into a cut
       buffer and to make a selection that contains the	 current  contents  of
       the  cut	 buffer.   It acts as a bridge between applications that don't
       support selections and those that do.

       By default, 4mxcutsel24m will use the selection named PRIMARY  and  the	cut
       buffer  CUT_BUFFER0.   Either  or  both	of  these can be overridden by
       command line arguments or by resources.

       An 4mxcutsel24m window has the following buttons:

	   4mquit0m
	       When this button is pressed,  4mxcutsel24m  exits.   Any	 selections
	       held by 4mxcutsel24m are automatically released.

	   4mcopy24m 4mPRIMARY24m 4mto24m 4m00m
	       When  this  button  is  pressed,	 4mxcutsel24m  copies  the  current
	       selection into the cut buffer.

	   4mcopy24m 4m024m 4mto24m 4mPRIMARY0m
	       When this button	 is  pressed,  4mxcutsel24m  converts  the  current
	       contents of the cut buffer into the selection.

       The  button  labels  reflect  the  selection  and cutbuffer selected by
       command line options or through the resource database.

       When the ``copy 0 to PRIMARY'' button is	 activated,  the  button  will
       remain  inverted as long as 4mxcutsel24m remains the owner of the selection.
       This serves to remind you which	client	owns  the  current  selection.
       Note that the value of the selection remains constant; if the cutbuffer
       is changed, you must again activate the copy button to retrieve the new
       value when desired.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXcutsel24m  accepts  all of the standard X Toolkit command line options as
       well as the following:

       1m-selection 4m22mname0m
	       This option specifies the name of the selection	to  use.   The
	       default	is PRIMARY.  The only supported abbreviations for this
	       option are ``-select'', ``-sel'' and ``-s'',  as	 the  standard
	       toolkit option ``-selectionTimeout'' has a similar name.

       1m-cutbuffer 4m22mnumber0m
	       This  option  specifies	the cut buffer to use.	The default is
	       cut buffer 0.

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       This program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource  names  and
       classes as well as:

       1mselection (22mclass 1mSelection)0m
	       This  resource specifies the name of the selection to use.  The
	       default is PRIMARY.

       1mcutBuffer (22mclass 1mCutBuffer)0m
	       This resource specifies the number of the cut  buffer  to  use.
	       The default is 0.

1mWIDGET NAMES0m
       The following instance names may be used when user configuration of the
       labels in them is desired:

       1msel-cut (22mclass 1mCommand)0m
	       This is the ``copy SELECTION to BUFFER'' button.

       1mcut-sel (22mclass 1mCommand)0m
	       This is the ``copy BUFFER to SELECTION'' button.

       1mquit (22mclass 1mCommand)0m
	       This is the ``quit'' button.

XDITVIEW(1)							   XDITVIEW(1)



1mNAME0m
       xditview - display ditroff output

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxditview 22m[ -4mtoolkitoption24m ... ] [ -4moption24m ... ] [ 4mfilename24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxditview24m program displays 4mditroff24m output on an X display.	It  uses
       no  special  metrics and automatically converts the printer coordinates
       into screen coordinates; using the  user-specified  screen  resolution,
       rather  than the actual resolution so that the appropriate fonts can be
       found.  If ``1m-22m'' is given as the 4mfilename,24m 4mxditview24m reads from standard
       input.	If ``1m|22m'' is the first character of 4mfilename,24m 4mxditview24m forks 4msh0m
       to run the rest of the ``file name'' and uses the  standard  output  of
       that command.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXditview24m  accepts  all  of	the standard X Toolkit command line options
       along with the additional options listed below:

       1m-page 4m22mpage-number0m
	       This option specifies the page number of	 the  document	to  be
	       displayed at start up time.

       1m-resolution 4m22mscreen-resolution0m
	       This specifies the desired screen resolution to use; fonts will
	       be opened by requesting	this  resolution  field	 in  the  XLFD
	       names.

       1m-noPolyText0m
	       Some  X	servers	 incorrectly  implement PolyText with multiple
	       strings per request.  This option suppresses the	 use  of  this
	       feature in 4mxditview.0m

       1m-backingStore 4m22mbacking-store-type0m
	       Redisplay can take up to a second or so; this option causes the
	       server to save the window contents so that when it is  scrolled
	       around  the viewport, the window is painted from contents saved
	       in backing store.  4mbacking-store-type24m can  be  one	of  1mAlways22m,
	       1mWhenMapped 22mor 1mNotUseful22m.

       The  following  standard	 X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly
       used with 4mxditview:0m

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color to use for  the	background  of
	       the window.  The default is 4mwhite24m.

       1m-bd 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the border of the
	       window.	The default is 4mblack24m.

       1m-bw 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option  specifies  the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding the window.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  color to use for displaying text.
	       The default is 4mblack24m.

       1m-fn 4m22mfont0m
	       This option specifies the font to be used for displaying widget
	       text.  The default is 4mfixed24m.

       1m-rv	 22mThis option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
	       swapping the foreground and background colors.

       1m-geometry 4m22mgeometry0m
	       This option specifies the preferred size and  position  of  the
	       window.

       1m-display 4m22mhost24m1m:4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the X server to contact.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       This option specifies a resource string to be used.

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       This  program  uses  a  4mDvi24m	 widget.   It  understands  all of the core
       resource names and classes as well as:


       1mwidth (22mclass 1mWidth)0m
	       Specifies the width of the window.

       1mheight (22mclass 1mHeight)0m
	       Specifies the height of the window.

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies the default foreground color.

       1mfont (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies the font to be used for error messages.

       1mFontMap (class FontMap)0m
	       To associate the 4mditroff24m fonts with appropriate X  fonts,  this
	       string	resource   contains   a	  set  of  new-line  separated
	       specifications, each of which consists of a ditroff name,  some
	       white   space   and  an	XLFD  pattern  with  *	characters  in
	       appropriate places to  allow  all  sizes	 to  be	 listed.   The

1mUSING XDITVIEW WITH DITROFF0m
       You can use any ditroff output file with 4mxditview,24m although files which
       use the fonts appropriate to the fontMap will look more accurate on the
       screen.	 On  servers  which  support  scaled fonts, all requested font
       sizes will be accurately reflected on the screen; for servers which  do
       not  support  scaled  4mxditview24m  will use the closest font from the same
       family.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXdm24m	 manages a collection of X displays, which may be on the local host
       or remote servers.  The design of 4mxdm24m was guided  by  the  needs  of  X
       terminals  as  well  as	The  Open  Group standard XDMCP, the 4mX24m 4mDisplay0m
       4mManager24m 4mControl24m 4mProtocol24m.	  4mXdm24m  provides  services	similar	 to  those
       provided by 4minit24m, 4mgetty24m and 4mlogin24m on character terminals: prompting for
       login name  and	password,  authenticating  the	user,  and  running  a
       ``session.''

       A  ``session''  is  defined by the lifetime of a particular process; in
       the traditional character-based terminal world, it is the user's	 login
       shell.	In  the 4mxdm24m context, it is an arbitrary session manager.  This
       is because in a windowing environment, a	 user's	 login	shell  process
       does  not  necessarily  have  any terminal-like interface with which to
       connect.	 When a real  session  manager	is  not	 available,  a	window
       manager	or  terminal  emulator	is  typically  used  as	 the ``session
       manager,'' meaning that termination  of	this  process  terminates  the
       user's session.

       When   the   session  is	 terminated,  4mxdm24m	resets	the  X	server	and
       (optionally) restarts the whole process.

       When 4mxdm24m receives an Indirect query via XDMCP, it  can  run	 a  4mchooser0m
       process	to  perform  an	 XDMCP	BroadcastQuery	(or  an XDMCP Query to
       specified hosts) on behalf of the display and offer a menu of  possible
       hosts that offer XDMCP display management.  This feature is useful with
       X terminals that do not offer a host menu themselves.

       4mXdm24m can be configured to ignore BroadcastQuery messages  from  selected
       hosts.	This is useful when you don't want the host to appear in menus
       produced by 4mchooser24m or X terminals themselves.

       Because 4mxdm24m provides the first interface that users	 will  see,  it	 is
       designed	 to  be	 simple to use and easy to customize to the needs of a
       particular site.	 4mXdm24m has many options, most of which  have	 reasonable
       defaults.   Browse through the various sections of this manual, picking
       and choosing the things you want to change.  Pay	 particular  attention
       to  the	1mSession Program 22msection, which will describe how to set up the
       style of session desired.

1mOVERVIEW0m
       4mxdm24m is highly configurable, and most of its behavior can be	 controlled
       by  resource  files  and	 shell	scripts.   The	names  of  these files
       themselves are resources read from the  file  4mxdm-config24m  or  the  file
       named by the 1m-config 22moption.

       4mxdm24m	 offers	 display  management  two  different ways.  It can manage X
       servers running on the local machine and specified in 4mXservers24m, and	 it
       can  manage  remote  X servers (typically X terminals) using XDMCP (the
       XDM Control Protocol) as specified in the 4mXaccess24m file.

       The resources of the X clients run by 4mxdm24m outside the  user's  session,
       including  4mxdm24m's own login window, can be affected by setting resources
       in the 4mXresources24m file.

       For X terminals that do not offer  a  menu  of  hosts  to  get  display
       management  from,  4mxdm24m  can	 collect  willing hosts and run the 4mchooser0m
       program to offer the user a menu.  For X displays attached to  a	 host,
       this  step  is  typically  not used, as the local host does the display
       management.

       After resetting the X server, 4mxdm24m runs the 4mXsetup24m script to  assist  in
       setting up the screen the user sees along with the 4mxlogin24m widget.

       The  4mxlogin24m	 widget,  which 4mxdm24m presents, offers the familiar login and
       password prompts.

       After the user logs in, 4mxdm24m runs the 4mXstartup24m script as root.

       Then 4mxdm24m runs the 4mXsession24m script as the  user.   This	 system	 session
       file  may  do  some additional startup and typically runs the 4m.xsession0m
       script in the user's home directory.  When the 4mXsession24m  script  exits,
       the session is over.

       At  the end of the session, the 4mXreset24m script is run to clean up, the X
       server is reset, and the cycle starts over.

       The file	 4mXDMLOGDIR/xdm.log24m will contain error messages  from  4mxdm24m  and
       anything	 output	 to  stderr  by	 4mXsetup,24m 4mXstartup,24m 4mXsession24m or 4mXreset24m.
       When you have trouble getting 4mxdm24m working, check this file	to  see	 if
       4mxdm24m has any clues to the trouble.

1mOPTIONS0m
       All  of	these  options, except 1m-config 22mitself, specify values that can
       also be specified in the configuration file as resources.

       1m-config 4m22mconfiguration_file0m
	      Names the	 configuration	file,  which  specifies	 resources  to
	      control  the behavior of 4mxdm.24m  4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config0m
	      is the default.  See the section 1mConfiguration File22m.

       1m-nodaemon0m
	      Specifies	    ``false''	  as	 the	 value	   for	   the
	      1mDisplayManager.daemonMode  22mresource.	 This suppresses the normal
	      daemon behavior, which is for 4mxdm24m to close all file descriptors,
	      disassociate  itself  from  the  controlling  terminal,  and put
	      itself in the background when it first starts up.

       1m-debug 4m22mdebug_level0m
	      Specifies the numeric value  for	the  1mDisplayManager.debugLevel0m
	      resource.	  A  non-zero  value  causes  4mxdm24m	to  print  lots	 of
	      debugging statements to  the  terminal;  it  also	 disables  the
	      1mDisplayManager.daemonMode   22mresource,   forcing   4mxdm24m	to   run
	      synchronously.  To interpret these debugging messages, a copy of
	      the  source  code for 4mxdm24m is almost a necessity.  No attempt has
	      been made to rationalize or standardize the output.

       1m-error 4m22merror_log_file0m
	      Specifies	 the   value   for   the   1mDisplayManager.errorLogFile0m
	      resource.	  This	file  contains	errors	from  4mxdm24m	as  well as
	      anything written to stderr by the various scripts	 and  programs
	      run during the progress of the session.

       1m-resources 4m22mresource_file0m
	      Specifies	 the  value for the 1mDisplayManager*resources 22mresource.
	      This  file  is  loaded  using  4mxrdb24m	to  specify   configuration
	      parameters for the authentication widget.

       1m-server 4m22mserver_entry0m
	      Specifies	 the  value  for  the 1mDisplayManager.servers 22mresource.
	      See the section 1mLocal Server Specification 22mfor a description	 of
	      this resource.

       1m-udpPort 4m22mport_number0m
	      Specifies the value for the 1mDisplayManager.requestPort 22mresource.
	      This sets the port-number	 which	4mxdm24m  will	monitor	 for  XDMCP
	      requests.	 As XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177,
	      this resource should not be changed except for debugging. If set
	      to 0 xdm will not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests.

       1m-session 4m22msession_program0m
	      Specifies	 the  value  for  the 1mDisplayManager*session 22mresource.
	      This indicates the program to run as the session after the  user
	      has logged in.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresource_specification0m
	      Allows  an  arbitrary  resource  to  be  specified, as in most X
	      Toolkit applications.

1mRESOURCES0m
       At many stages the actions of 4mxdm24m can be controlled through the use	 of
       its  configuration  file,  which	 is  in	 the  X resource format.  Some
       resources modify the behavior of 4mxdm24m  on  all  displays,  while  others
       modify  its  behavior  on  a single display.  Where actions relate to a
       specific display, the display name is inserted into the	resource  name
       between ``DisplayManager'' and the final resource name segment.

       For  local  displays,  the resource name and class are as read from the
       4mXservers24m file.

       For remote displays, the resource name is what the network  address  of
       the display resolves to.	 See the 1mremoveDomain 22mresource.  The name must
       match exactly; 4mxdm24m is not aware of all the network aliases	that  might
       reach a given display.  If the name resolve fails, the address is used.
       The resource class is as sent  by  the  display	in  the	 XDMCP	Manage
       request.

       Because	the  resource  manager uses colons to separate the name of the
       resource from its value and dots to separate resource name  parts,  4mxdm0m
       substitutes  underscores	 for  both dots and colons when generating the
       resource name.  For example, 1mDisplayManager.expo_x_org_0.startup 22mis the
       name  of	 the  resource	which  defines	the startup shell file for the
       ``expo.x.org:0'' display.

       1mDisplayManager.servers0m
	      This resource either  specifies  a  file	name  full  of	server
	      entries,	one  per line (if the value starts with a slash), or a
	      single server entry.  See the section 1mLocal Server Specification0m
	      for the details.

       1mDisplayManager.requestPort0m
	      This  indicates the UDP port number which 4mxdm24m uses to listen for
	      incoming XDMCP requests.	Unless you need to debug  the  system,
	      leave this with its default value of 177.

       1mDisplayManager.errorLogFile0m
	      Error  output  is	 normally  directed at the system console.  To
	      redirect it, set this resource to a file name.  A method to send
	      these  messages  to 4msyslog24m should be developed for systems which
	      support it; however, the wide variety  of	 interfaces  precludes
	      any  system-independent implementation.  This file also contains
	      any output directed to stderr by the 4mXsetup,24m 4mXstartup,24m	4mXsession0m
	      and 4mXreset24m files, so it will contain descriptions of problems in
	      those scripts as well.

       1mDisplayManager.debugLevel0m
	      If the integer value of this  resource  is  greater  than	 zero,
	      reams  of	 debugging  information	 will  be  printed.   It  also
	      disables daemon mode, which would redirect the information  into
	      the  bit-bucket,	and  allows  non-root  users to run 4mxdm,24m which
	      would normally not be useful.

       1mDisplayManager.daemonMode0m
	      Normally, 4mxdm24m attempts to make  itself  into	 a  daemon  process
	      unassociated with any terminal.  This is accomplished by forking
	      and leaving the  parent  process	to  exit,  then	 closing  file
	      descriptors  and	releasing  the	controlling terminal.  In some
	      environments  this  is  not   desired   (in   particular,	  when
	      debugging).   Setting  this  resource  to ``false'' will disable
	      this feature.

       1mDisplayManager.pidFile0m
	      The filename specified will  be  created	to  contain  an	 ASCII
	      representation  of  the process-id of the main 4mxdm24m process.	4mXdm0m
	      also uses file locking on this  file  to	attempt	 to  eliminate
	      multiple	daemons running on the same machine, which would cause
	      quite a bit of havoc.

       1mDisplayManager.lockPidFile0m
	      This is the  resource  which  controls  whether  4mxdm24m	 uses  file
	      locking to keep multiple display managers from running amok.  On
	      System V, this uses the 4mlockf24m library call, while on BSD it uses
	      4mflock.0m

       1mDisplayManager.authDir0m
	      This  names  a  directory	 under	which 4mxdm24m stores authorization
	      files while initializing the  session.   The  default  value  is
	      4mXDMAUTHDIR24m.	  Can	be  overridden	for  specific  displays	 by
	      DisplayManager.4mDISPLAY24m.authFile.

       1mDisplayManager.autoRescan0m
	      This boolean controls whether  4mxdm24m  rescans	the  configuration,
	      servers,	access	control	 and authentication keys files after a
	      session terminates and the files have changed.  By default it is
	      ``true.''	  You can force 4mxdm24m to reread these files by sending a
	      SIGHUP to the main process.

       1mDisplayManager.removeDomainname0m
	      When computing the display name  for  XDMCP  clients,  the  name
	      resolver	will  typically create a fully qualified host name for
	      the terminal.  As this is sometimes confusing, 4mxdm24m  will  remove
	      the  domain  name	 portion of the host name if it is the same as
	      the domain name of the local host when this variable is set.  By
	      default the value is ``true.''

       1mDisplayManager.keyFile0m
	      XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1  style XDMCP authentication requires that a
	      private key be  shared  between  4mxdm24m	 and  the  terminal.   This
	      resource specifies the file containing those values.  Each entry
	      in the file consists of a display name and the shared  key.   By
	      default,	4mxdm24m does not include support for XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1,
	      as it requires DES which is not generally distributable  because
	      of United States export restrictions.

       1mDisplayManager.accessFile0m
	      To prevent unauthorized XDMCP service and to allow forwarding of
	      XDMCP IndirectQuery requests, this file contains a  database  of
	      hostnames	 which	are  either  allowed  direct  access  to  this
	      machine, or have a list of hosts	to  which  queries  should  be
	      forwarded	 to.   The  format  of	this  file is described in the
	      section 1mXDMCP Access Control.0m

       1mDisplayManager.exportList0m
	      A list of additional environment variables, separated  by	 white
	      space,  to pass on to the 4mXsetup24m, 4mXstartup24m, 4mXsession24m, and 4mXreset0m
	      programs.

       1mDisplayManager.randomFile0m
	      A file to checksum to generate the seed of  authorization	 keys.
	      This  should  be a file that changes frequently.	The default is
	      4m/dev/mem24m.









       1mDisplayManager.prngdSocket0m

       1mDisplayManager.prngPort0m
	      A UNIX domain socket name or a TCP socket port number  on	 local
	      host  on which a Pseudo-Random Number Generator Daemon, like EGD
	      (http://egd.sourceforge.net) is listening, in order to  generate
	      the  autorization keys. Either a non null port or a valid socket
	      name must be specified. The default is to	 use  the  Unix-domain
	      socket 4m/tmp/entropy24m.

       On systems that don't have such a daemon, a fall-back entropy gathering
       system, based on various log file contents hashed by the MD5  algorithm
       is used instead.


       1mDisplayManager.greeterLib0m
	      On  systems that support a dynamically-loadable greeter library,
	      the name of the library.	The default is
	       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/libXdmGreet.so24m.

       1mDisplayManager.choiceTimeout0m
	      Number of seconds to wait for display to respond after user  has
	      selected a host from the chooser.	 If the display sends an XDMCP
	      IndirectQuery within this time, the request is forwarded to  the
	      chosen  host.  Otherwise, it is assumed to be from a new session
	      and the chooser is offered again.	 Default is 15.

       1mDisplayManager.sourceAddress0m
	      Use the  numeric	IP  address  of	 the  incoming	connection  on
	      multihomed  hosts	 instead  of  the  host name. This is to avoid
	      trying to connect on the wrong interface which might be down  at
	      this time.

       1mDisplayManager.willing0m
	      This specifies a program which is run (as) root when an an XDMCP
	      BroadcastQuery is received and this host is configured to	 offer
	      XDMCP  display  management.  The	output	of this program may be
	      displayed on a chooser window.  If no program is specified,  the
	      string 4mWilling24m 4mto24m 4mmanage24m is sent.


       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resources0m
	      This  resource  specifies	 the  name of the file to be loaded by
	      4mxrdb24m as the resource database onto the root window of  screen  0
	      of  the  display.	  The  4mXsetup24m  program,  the Login widget, and
	      4mchooser24m will use the resources set in this file.  This  resource
	      data  base is loaded just before the authentication procedure is
	      started, so it can control the appearance of the	login  window.
	      See  the	section	 1mAuthentication  Widget,  22mwhich  describes the
	      various resources that are appropriate to place  in  this	 file.
	      There is no default value for this resource, but
	       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources24m is the conventional name.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.chooser0m
	      Specifies	 the  program  run  to	offer a host menu for Indirect
	      queries redirected to the special host name CHOOSER.
	       4mCHOOSERPATH24m	 is the default.  See  the  sections  1mXDMCP  Access0m
	      1mControl 22mand 1mChooser22m.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.xrdb0m
	      Specifies	 the  program used to load the resources.  By default,
	      4mxdm24m uses  4m/usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb24m.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.cpp0m
	      This specifies the name of the C preprocessor which is  used  by
	      4mxrdb24m.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.setup0m
	      This  specifies a program which is run (as root) before offering
	      the Login window.	 This may be used to change the appearance  of
	      the  screen  around  the Login window or to put up other windows
	      (e.g., you may want to  run  4mxconsole24m  here).   By  default,	 no
	      program  is  run.	 The conventional name for a file used here is
	      4mXsetup24m.  See the section 1mSetup Program.0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.startup0m
	      This specifies a program	which  is  run	(as  root)  after  the
	      authentication process succeeds.	By default, no program is run.
	      The conventional name for a file used here is 4mXstartup24m.  See the
	      section 1mStartup Program.0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.session0m
	      This specifies the session to be executed (not running as root).
	      By default,  4m/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm24m is run.  The conventional name
	      is 4mXsession24m.	 See the section 1mSession Program.0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.reset0m
	      This  specifies  a  program  which  is  run  (as root) after the
	      session  terminates.   By	 default,  no  program	is  run.   The
	      conventional name is 4mXreset24m.	 See the section 1mReset Program.0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.openDelay0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.openRepeat0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.openTimeout0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.startAttempts0m
	      These  numeric  resources	 control  the  behavior	 of  4mxdm24m  when
	      attempting to  open  intransigent	 servers.   1mopenDelay	 22mis	the
	      length  of  the  pause (in seconds) between successive attempts,
	      1mopenRepeat 22mis the number of attempts to make, 1mopenTimeout 22mis the
	      amount of time to wait while actually attempting the open (i.e.,
	      the maximum time	spent  in  the	4mconnect24m(2)	 system	 call)	and
	      1mstartAttempts 22mis the number of times this entire process is done
	      before giving up on the server.  After 1mopenRepeat 22mattempts  have
	      been  made,  or  if 1mopenTimeout 22mseconds elapse in any particular
	      attempt, 4mxdm24m terminates and restarts the server,  attempting	 to
	      connect again.  This process is repeated 1mstartAttempts 22mtimes, at
	      which point the display is declared dead and disabled.  Although
	      this  behavior  may  seem	 arbitrary,  it	 has  been empirically
	      developed and works quite well on	 most  systems.	  The  default
	      values are 5 for 1mopenDelay22m, 5 for 1mopenRepeat22m, 30 for 1mopenTimeout0m
	      and 4 for 1mstartAttempts22m.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.pingInterval0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.pingTimeout0m
	      To discover when remote  displays	 disappear,  4mxdm24m  occasionally
	      pings them, using an X connection and 4mXSync24m calls.  1mpingInterval0m
	      specifies the time  (in  minutes)	 between  each	ping  attempt,
	      1mpingTimeout 22mspecifies the maximum amount of time (in minutes) to
	      wait for the  terminal  to  respond  to  the  request.   If  the
	      terminal	does  not  respond,  the  session is declared dead and
	      terminated.  By default, both are set  to	 5  minutes.   If  you
	      frequently  use  X  terminals which can become isolated from the
	      managing host, you may wish to increase this  value.   The  only
	      worry is that sessions will continue to exist after the terminal
	      has  been	 accidentally  disabled.   4mxdm24m  will  not	ping  local
	      displays.	  Although  it	would  seem harmless, it is unpleasant
	      when the workstation session is terminated as a  result  of  the
	      server hanging for NFS service and not responding to the ping.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.terminateServer0m
	      This  boolean  resource specifies whether the X server should be
	      terminated when a session terminates (instead of resetting  it).
	      This  option  can	 be used when the server tends to grow without
	      bound over time, in order to limit the amount of time the server
	      is run.  The default value is ``false.''

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.userPath0m
	      4mXdm24m	sets  the PATH environment variable for the session to this
	      value.  It should be a colon separated list of directories;  see
	      4msh24m(1)	  for	       a	  full	       description.
	      ``:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb'' is a common  setting.
	      The default value can be specified at build time in the X system
	      configuration file with DefaultUserPath.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemPath0m
	      4mXdm24m sets the PATH environment variable for the startup and reset
	      scripts  to  the	value  of this resource.  The default for this
	      resource is specified at build  time  by	the  DefaultSystemPath
	      entry	 in	 the	  system      configuration	 file;
	      ``/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb''   is   a	common
	      choice.	Note  the absence of ``.'' from this entry.  This is a
	      good practice to follow for root; it avoids many	common	Trojan
	      Horse system penetration schemes.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemShell0m
	      4mXdm24m	sets  the  SHELL  environment  variable for the startup and
	      reset scripts to the value of this resource.  It is  4m/bin/sh24m	 by
	      default.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.failsafeClient0m
	      If  the  default session fails to execute, 4mxdm24m will fall back to
	      this program.  This program is executed with no  arguments,  but
	      executes	using  the  same  environment variables as the session
	      would have had (see the section 1mSession Program22m).   By  default,
	      4m/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm24m is used.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.grabServer0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.grabTimeout0m
	      To  improve  security,  4mxdm24m	grabs the server and keyboard while
	      reading the login name and password.   The  1mgrabServer	22mresource
	      specifies	 if  the server should be held for the duration of the
	      name/password reading.  When ``false,'' the server is  ungrabbed
	      after  the  keyboard  grab  succeeds,  otherwise	the  server is
	      grabbed until just before the session begins.   The  default  is
	      ``false.''   The 1mgrabTimeout 22mresource specifies the maximum time
	      4mxdm24m will wait for the grab to succeed.  The	grab  may  fail	 if
	      some  other  client  has	the server grabbed, or possibly if the
	      network latencies are very high.	This resource  has  a  default
	      value of 3 seconds; you should be cautious when raising it, as a
	      user can be spoofed by a look-alike window on the	 display.   If
	      the  grab fails, 4mxdm24m kills and restarts the server (if possible)
	      and the session.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.authorize0m

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.authName0m
	      1mauthorize 22mis a  boolean  resource  which  controls  whether	4mxdm0m
	      generates	  and	uses   authorization   for  the	 local	server
	      connections.  If authorization is used, 1mauthName 22mis	a  list	 of
	      authorization  mechanisms	 to  use,  separated  by  white space.
	      XDMCP  connections  dynamically  specify	 which	 authorization
	      mechanisms  are  supported, so 1mauthName 22mis ignored in this case.
	      When 1mauthorize 22mis set for a display	and  authorization  is	not
	      available,  the  user  is informed by having a different message
	      displayed	 in  the  login	 widget.   By  default,	 1mauthorize  22mis
	      ``true.''	  1mauthName  22mis  ``MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,''  or,  if  XDM-
	      AUTHORIZATION-1 is  available,  ``XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 MIT-MAGIC-
	      COOKIE-1.''

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.authFile0m
	      This file is used to communicate the authorization data from 4mxdm0m
	      to the server, using the 1m-auth 22mserver command line  option.	 It
	      should  be kept in a directory which is not world-writable as it
	      could easily be removed, disabling the  authorization  mechanism
	      in  the  server.	 If  not  specified,  a name is generated from
	      DisplayManager.authDir and the name of the display.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.authComplain0m
	      If set to ``false,'' disables the use of the 1munsecureGreeting 22min
	      the  login  window.  See the section 1mAuthentication Widget.  22mThe
	      default is ``true.''

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resetSignal0m
	      The number of the signal 4mxdm24m sends to reset the server.  See the
	      section 1mControlling the Server.	 22mThe default is 1 (SIGHUP).

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.termSignal0m
	      The number of the signal 4mxdm24m sends to terminate the server.	See
	      the  section  1mControlling  the	Server.	  22mThe  default   is	 15
	      (SIGTERM).

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resetForAuth0m
	      The  original  implementation  of	 authorization	in  the sample
	      server reread the	 authorization	file  at  server  reset	 time,
	      instead  of  when	 checking  the	initial	 connection.   As  4mxdm0m
	      generates the authorization information just  before  connecting
	      to   the	display,  an  old  server  would  not  get  up-to-date
	      authorization information.  This resource	 causes	 4mxdm24m  to  send
	      SIGHUP  to  the  server  after  setting  up the file, causing an
	      additional server reset to occur,	 during	 which	time  the  new
	      authorization   information   will  be  read.   The  default  is
	      ``false,'' which will work for all MIT servers.

       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.userAuthDir0m
	      When 4mxdm24m is unable to write to the usual user authorization file
	      ($HOME/.Xauthority),  it	creates	 a  unique  file  name in this
	      directory and points the environment variable XAUTHORITY at  the
	      created file.  It uses 4m/tmp24m by default.

1mCONFIGURATION FILE0m
       First,  the  4mxdm24m configuration file should be set up.  Make a directory
       (usually	 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm24m) to contain all of the relevant files.

       Here  is	 a  reasonable	configuration  file, which could be named 4mxdm-0m
       4mconfig24m:


	    DisplayManager.servers:	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers
	    DisplayManager.errorLogFile:       XDMLOGDIR/xdm.log
	    DisplayManager*resources:	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	    DisplayManager*startup:	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xstartup
	    DisplayManager*session:	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
	    DisplayManager.pidFile:	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-pid
	    DisplayManager._0.authorize:       true
	    DisplayManager*authorize:	       false


       Note that this file mostly contains references to  other	 files.	  Note
       also that some of the resources are specified with ``*'' separating the
       components.  These resources can be  made  unique  for  each  different
       display,	 by  replacing	the  ``*'' with the display-name, but normally
       this is not very useful.	 See the  1mResources  22msection  for	a  complete
       discussion.

1mXDMCP ACCESS CONTROL0m
       The  database  file specified by the 1mDisplayManager.accessFile 22mprovides
       information which 4mxdm24m uses to control access from  displays	 requesting
       XDMCP  service.	 This  file  contains three types of entries:  entries
       which control the response to Direct  and  Broadcast  queries,  entries
       which  control the response to Indirect queries, and macro definitions.

       The format of the Direct entries is simple, either a  host  name	 or  a
       pattern,	 which	is  distinguished from a host name by the inclusion of
       one or more meta characters (`*' matches any  sequence  of  0  or  more
       characters,  and	 `?'  matches any single character) which are compared
       against the host name of the display device.  If the entry  is  a  host
       name,  all  comparisons	are  done using network addresses, so any name
       which converts to  the  correct	network	 address  may  be  used.   For
       patterns,  only	canonical  host	 names	are used in the comparison, so
       ensure that you do not attempt to match aliases.	  Preceding  either  a
       host  name  or  a pattern with a `!' character causes hosts which match
       that entry to be excluded.

       To only respond to Direct queries for a host  or	 pattern,  it  can  be
       followed	 by the optional ``NOBROADCAST'' keyword.  This can be used to
       prevent an xdm server  from  appearing  on  menus  based	 on  Broadcast
       queries.

       An  Indirect entry also contains a host name or pattern, but follows it
       with a list of host names or macros to which indirect queries should be
       sent.

       A  macro	 definition contains a macro name and a list of host names and
       other macros that the macro expands to.	 To  distinguish  macros  from
       hostnames,  macro  names	 start	with  a	 `%' character.	 Macros may be
       nested.

       Indirect entries may also specify to have 4mxdm24m run 4mchooser24m  to	offer  a
       menu of hosts to connect to.  See the section 1mChooser22m.

       When  checking  access  for  a  particular  display host, each entry is
       scanned in turn and the first matching entry determines	the  response.
       Direct  and Broadcast entries are ignored when scanning for an Indirect
       entry and vice-versa.

       Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment delimiter  causing
       the  rest of that line to be ignored, and `\4mnewline24m' causes the newline
       to be ignored, allowing indirect host lists to span multiple lines.

       Here is an example Xaccess file:

       #
       # Xaccess - XDMCP access control file
       #

       #
       # Direct/Broadcast query entries
       #

       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   # disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
       bambi.ogi.edu	   # allow access from this particular display
       *.lcs.mit.edu	   # allow access from any display in LCS

       *.deshaw.com	   NOBROADCAST	       # allow only direct access
       *.gw.com				       # allow direct and broadcast

       #
       # Indirect query entries
       #

       %HOSTS		   expo.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu \
			   excess.lcs.mit.edu kanga.lcs.mit.edu

       extract.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu   #force extract to contact xenon
       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   dummy	       #disallow indirect access
       *.lcs.mit.edu	   %HOSTS	       #all others get to choose

       If compiled with IPv6 support, multicast address	 groups	 may  also  be
       included	 in  the  list	of  addresses  indirect	 queries  are  set to.
       Multicast addresses may be followed by an optional / character and  hop
       count.  If  no hop count is specified, the multicast hop count defaults
       to 1, keeping the packet on the local network. For  IPv4	 multicasting,
       the hop count is used as the TTL.

       Examples:

       rincewind.sample.net ff02::1		    #IPv6 Multicast to ff02::1
						    #with a hop count of 1
       ponder.sample.net    CHOOSER 239.192.1.1/16  #Offer a menu of hosts
						    #who respond to IPv4 Multicast
						    # to 239.192.1.1 with a TTL of 16

1mCHOOSER0m
       For X terminals that do not offer a host menu for use with Broadcast or
       Indirect queries, the 4mchooser24m program can do this  for  them.   In	the
       4mXaccess24m  file,  specify  ``CHOOSER'' as the first entry in the Indirect
       host list.  4mChooser24m will send a Query request to each of the  remaining
       host  names in the list and offer a menu of all the hosts that respond.

       The list may consist of the word ``BROADCAST,'' in which	 case  4mchooser0m
       will  send a Broadcast instead, again offering a menu of all hosts that
       respond.	 Note that on some operating systems, UDP  packets  cannot  be
       broadcast, so this feature will not work.

       Example 4mXaccess24m file using 4mchooser24m:

       extract.lcs.mit.edu  CHOOSER %HOSTS	    #offer a menu of these hosts
       xtra.lcs.mit.edu	    CHOOSER BROADCAST	    #offer a menu of all hosts

       The    program	 to    use   for   4mchooser24m	  is   specified   by	the
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.chooser 22mresource.	For more flexibility at	 this
       step,  the  chooser  could  be  a shell script.	4mChooser24m is the session
       manager here; it is run instead of a child 4mxdm24m to manage the display.

       Resources  for  this  program  can  be  put  into  the  file  named  by
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resources22m.

       When  the user selects a host, 4mchooser24m prints the host chosen, which is
       read by the parent 4mxdm24m, and exits.	4mxdm24m closes its connection to the  X
       server, and the server resets and sends another 1mIndirect 22mXDMCP request.
       4mxdm24m	 remembers  the	 user's	 choice	 (for  1mDisplayManager.choiceTimeout0m
       seconds)	 and  forwards	the request to the chosen host, which starts a
       session on that display.

1mLISTEN0m
       The following configuration directive is also defined for  the  Xaccess
       configuration file:

       1mLISTEN 4m22minterface24m 4m[list24m 4mof24m 4mmulticast24m 4mgroup24m 4maddresses]0m
	      4minterface24m  may  be  a  hostname  or	IP  addresss representing a
	      network  interface  on  this  machine,  or  the  wildcard	 *  to
	      represent all available network interfaces.

       If  one	or more LISTEN lines are specified, xdm only listens for XDMCP
       connections on the specified interfaces. If multicast  group  addresses
       are  listed  on	a  listen  line, xdm joins the multicast groups on the
       given interface.

       If no LISTEN lines are given, the original behavior of listening on all
       interfaces  is preserved for backwards compatibility.  Additionally, if
       no LISTEN is specified, xdm joins  the  default	XDMCP  IPv6  multicast
       group, when compiled with IPv6 support.

       To  disable listening for XDMCP connections altogther, a line of LISTEN
       with no addresses may be specified, or the previously supported	method
       of setting DisplayManager.requestPort to 0 may be used.

       Examples:
       LISTEN * ff02::1	   # Listen on all interfaces and to the
			   # ff02::1 IPv6 multicast group.
       LISTEN 10.11.12.13  # Listen only on this interface, as long
			   # as no other listen directives appear in
			   # file.

1mIPv6 MULTICAST ADDRESS SPECIFICATION0m
       The    Internet	 Assigned   Numbers   Authority	  has	has   assigned
       ff04mX24m:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b as the permanently  assigned  range  of  multicast
       addresses  for  XDMCP. The 4mX24m in the prefix may be replaced by any valid
       scope identifier, such as 1 for Node-Local, 2  for  Link-Local,	5  for
       Site-Local,  and	 so  on.   (See	 IETF  RFC 2373 or its replacement for
       further details and scope definitions.)	xdm defaults to	 listening  on
       the Link-Local scope address ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b to most closely match
       the old IPv4 subnet broadcast behavior.

1mLOCAL SERVER SPECIFICATION0m
       The resource 1mDisplayManager.servers 22mgives a server specification or, if
       the  values  starts  with  a  slash  (/), the name of a file containing
       server specifications, one per line.

       Each specification indicates  a	display	 which	should	constantly  be
       managed	and  which  is not using XDMCP.	 This method is used typically
       for local servers only.	If the resource	 or  the  file	named  by  the
       resource is empty, 4mxdm24m will offer XDMCP service only.

       Each specification consists of at least three parts:  a display name, a
       display class, a display type, and (for local servers) a	 command  line
       to  start the server.  A typical entry for local display number 0 would
       be:

	 :0 Digital-QV local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0

       The display types are:

       local	 local display: 4mxdm24m must run the server
       foreign	 remote display: 4mxdm24m opens an X connection to a running server


       The display name must be something that can be passed in	 the  1m-display0m
       option  to  an X program.  This string is used to generate the display-
       specific resource names, so be careful to match the  names  (e.g.,  use
       ``:0  Sun-CG3 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0'' instead of ``localhost:0 Sun-
       CG3 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0'' if your other resources	are  specified
       as  ``DisplayManager._0.session'').   The display class portion is also
       used in the display-specific resources, as the class of	the  resource.
       This is useful if you have a large collection of similar displays (such
       as a corral of X terminals) and would like to set resources for	groups
       of  them.   When	 using	XDMCP,	the display is required to specify the
       display class, so the manual for	 your  particular  X  terminal	should
       document	 the display class string for your device.  If it doesn't, you
       can run 4mxdm24m in debug mode and look at the  resource	 strings  which	 it
       generates for that device, which will include the class string.

       When  4mxdm24m  starts  a  session,  it	sets  up authorization data for the
       server.	For local  servers,  4mxdm24m  passes  ``1m-auth  4m22mfilename24m''  on  the
       server's command line to point it at its authorization data.  For XDMCP
       servers, 4mxdm24m passes the authorization data to the server via the 1mAccept0m
       XDMCP request.

1mRESOURCES FILE0m
       The  4mXresources24m  file is loaded onto the display as a resource database
       using 4mxrdb.24m	 As the authentication widget reads  this  database  before
       starting up, it usually contains parameters for that widget:

	    xlogin*login.translations: #override\
		 Ctrl<Key>R: abort-display()\n\/&
		 <Key>F1: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
		 <Key>Return: set-session-argument() finish-field()
	    xlogin*borderWidth: 3
	    xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST
	    #ifdef COLOR
	    xlogin*greetColor: CadetBlue
	    xlogin*failColor: red
	    #endif


       Please note the translations entry; it specifies a few new translations
       for the widget which allow users to escape  from	 the  default  session
       (and  avoid  troubles that may occur in it).  Note that if #override is
       not specified, the default translations are removed and replaced by the
       new value, not a very useful result as some of the default translations
       are quite useful (such as ``<Key>: insert-char ()'' which  responds  to
       normal typing).

       This file may also contain resources for the setup program and 4mchooser24m.

1mSETUP PROGRAM0m
       The 4mXsetup24m file is run after the server is reset, but before the  Login
       window is offered.  The file is typically a shell script.  It is run as
       root, so should be careful about security.  This is the place to change
       the root background or bring up other windows that should appear on the
       screen along with the Login widget.

       In  addition  to	 any  specified	 by   1mDisplayManager.exportList22m,	the
       following environment variables are passed:

	    DISPLAY	   the associated display name
	    PATH	   the value of 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemPath0m
	    SHELL	   the value of 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemShell0m
	    XAUTHORITY	   may be set to an authority file

       Note  that  since 4mxdm24m grabs the keyboard, any other windows will not be
       able to receive keyboard input.	They will be able to interact with the
       mouse,	however;   beware   of	potential  security  holes  here.   If
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.grabServer 22mis set, 4mXsetup24m will not  be  able	to
       connect	to  the display at all.	 Resources for this program can be put
       into the file named by 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resources22m.

       Here is a sample 4mXsetup24m script:

	    #!/bin/sh
	    # Xsetup_0 - setup script for one workstation
	    xcmsdb < /usr/X11R6/lib/monitors/alex.0
	    xconsole -geometry 480x130-0-0 -notify -verbose -exitOnFail &


1mAUTHENTICATION WIDGET0m
       The authentication widget reads a name/password pair from the keyboard.
       Nearly  every  imaginable  parameter can be controlled with a resource.
       Resources for this  widget  should  be  put  into  the  file  named  by
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resources22m.	 All of these have reasonable default
       values, so it is not necessary to specify any of them.

       1mxlogin.Login.width, xlogin.Login.height, xlogin.Login.x, xlogin.Login.y0m
	      The  geometry  of	 the  Login  widget   is   normally   computed
	      automatically.   If  you	wish to position it elsewhere, specify
	      each of these resources.

       1mxlogin.Login.foreground0m
	      The color used to display the typed-in user name.

       1mxlogin.Login.font0m
	      The font used to display the typed-in user name.

       1mxlogin.Login.greeting0m
	      A string which identifies	 this  window.	 The  default  is  ``X
	      Window System.''

       1mxlogin.Login.unsecureGreeting0m
	      When  X authorization is requested in the configuration file for
	      this display and none is in  use,	 this  greeting	 replaces  the
	      standard	greeting.   The	 default  is  ``This  is  an  unsecure
	      session''

       1mxlogin.Login.greetFont0m
	      The font used to display the greeting.

       1mxlogin.Login.greetColor0m
	      The color used to display the greeting.

       1mxlogin.Login.namePrompt0m
	      The string displayed to prompt for a  user  name.	  4mXrdb24m  strips
	      trailing	white  space from resource values, so to add spaces at
	      the end of the prompt (usually a nice thing), add spaces escaped
	      with backslashes.	 The default is ``Login:  ''

       1mxlogin.Login.passwdPrompt0m
	      The  string  displayed to prompt for a password.	The default is
	      ``Password:  ''

       1mxlogin.Login.promptFont0m
	      The font used to display both prompts.

       1mxlogin.Login.promptColor0m
	      The color used to display both prompts.

       1mxlogin.Login.fail0m
	      A message which is displayed when the authentication fails.  The
	      default is ``Login incorrect''

       1mxlogin.Login.failFont0m
	      The font used to display the failure message.

       1mxlogin.Login.failColor0m
	      The color used to display the failure message.

       1mxlogin.Login.failTimeout0m
	      The  number  of  seconds	that the failure message is displayed.
	      The default is 30.

       1mxlogin.Login.allowRootLogin0m
	      If set to ``false'', don't allow root (and any other  user  with
	      uid = 0) to log in directly.  The default is ``true''.

       1mxlogin.Login.allowNullPasswd0m
	      If set to ``true'', allow an otherwise failing password match to
	      succeed if the account does not require a password at all.   The
	      default is ``false'', so only users that have passwords assigned
	      can log in.

       1mxlogin.Login.translations0m
	      This specifies the  translations	used  for  the	login  widget.
	      Refer  to	 the X Toolkit documentation for a complete discussion
	      on translations.	The default translation table is:

		   Ctrl<Key>H:	  delete-previous-character() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>D:	  delete-character() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>B:	  move-backward-character() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>F:	  move-forward-character() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>A:	  move-to-begining() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>E:	  move-to-end() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>K:	  erase-to-end-of-line() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>U:	  erase-line() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>X:	  erase-line() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>C:	  restart-session() \n\
		   Ctrl<Key>\\:	  abort-session() \n\
		   <Key>BackSpace:delete-previous-character() \n\
		   <Key>Delete:	  delete-previous-character() \n\
		   <Key>Return:	  finish-field() \n\
		   <Key>:	  insert-char() \


       The actions which are supported by the widget are:

       delete-previous-character
	      Erases the character before the cursor.

       delete-character
	      Erases the character after the cursor.

       move-backward-character
	      Moves the cursor backward.

       move-forward-character
	      Moves the cursor forward.

       move-to-begining
	      (Apologies about the spelling error.)  Moves the cursor  to  the
	      beginning of the editable text.

       move-to-end
	      Moves the cursor to the end of the editable text.

       erase-to-end-of-line
	      Erases all text after the cursor.

       erase-line
	      Erases the entire text.

       finish-field
	      If  the  cursor  is  in the name field, proceeds to the password
	      field; if the cursor  is	in  the	 password  field,  checks  the
	      current name/password pair.  If the name/password pair is valid,
	      4mxdm24m starts  the  session.   Otherwise  the  failure	message	 is
	      displayed and the user is prompted again.

       abort-session
	      Terminates and restarts the server.

       abort-display
	      Terminates  the  server,	disabling  it.	 This  action  is  not
	      accessible in the	 default  configuration.   There  are  various
	      reasons  to  stop 4mxdm24m on a system console, such as when shutting
	      the system down, when using 4mxdmshell24m, to start another  type	 of
	      server,  or  to  generally  access  the  console.	 Sending 4mxdm24m a
	      SIGHUP will restart the display.	See  the  section  1mControlling0m
	      1mXDM22m.

       restart-session
	      Resets  the X server and starts a new session.  This can be used
	      when the resources have been changed and you want to  test  them
	      or when the screen has been overwritten with system messages.

       insert-char
	      Inserts the character typed.

       set-session-argument
	      Specifies	 a single word argument which is passed to the session
	      at startup.  See the section 1mSession Program22m.

       allow-all-access
	      Disables access control in the server.  This can	be  used  when
	      the  .Xauthority file cannot be created by 4mxdm.24m  Be very careful
	      using this; it might be better to disconnect  the	 machine  from
	      the network before doing this.

       On   some  systems  (OpenBSD)  the  user's  shell  must	be  listed  in
       4m/etc/shells24m to allow login through xdm. The normal password and account
       expiration dates are enforced too.

1mSTARTUP PROGRAM0m
       The  4mXstartup24m  program  is	run  as	 root when the user logs in.  It is
       typically a shell script.  Since it is run as root, 4mXstartup24m should	 be
       very  careful  about security.  This is the place to put commands which
       add entries to 4m/etc/utmp24m (the 4msessreg24m	program	 may  be  useful  here),
       mount  users'  home directories from file servers, or abort the session
       if logins are not allowed.

       In  addition  to	 any  specified	 by   1mDisplayManager.exportList22m,	the
       following environment variables are passed:

	    DISPLAY	   the associated display name
	    HOME	   the initial working directory of the user
	    LOGNAME	   the user name
	    USER	   the user name
	    PATH	   the value of 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemPath0m
	    SHELL	   the value of 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.systemShell0m
	    XAUTHORITY	   may be set to an authority file


       No  arguments  are  passed  to the script.  4mXdm24m waits until this script
       exits before starting the user session.	If  the	 exit  value  of  this
       script  is  non-zero,  4mxdm24m	discontinues the session and starts another
       authentication cycle.

       The sample 4mXstartup24m file shown  here  prevents  login  while  the  file
       4m/etc/nologin24m exists.  Thus this is not a complete example, but simply a
       demonstration of the available functionality.

       Here is a sample 4mXstartup24m script:

	    #!/bin/sh
	    #
	    # Xstartup
	    #
	    # This program is run as root after the user is verified
	    #
	    if [ -f /etc/nologin ]; then
		 xmessage -file /etc/nologin -timeout 30 -center
		 exit 1
	    fi
	    sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
	    /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/GiveConsole
	    exit 0

1mSESSION PROGRAM0m
       The 4mXsession24m program is the command which is run as the user's session.
       It is run with the permissions of the authorized user.

       In   addition   to  any	specified  by  1mDisplayManager.exportList22m,	the
       following environment variables are passed:

	    DISPLAY	   the associated display name
	    HOME	   the initial working directory of the user
	    LOGNAME	   the user name
	    USER	   the user name
	    PATH	   the value of 1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.userPath0m
	    SHELL	   the user's default shell (from 4mgetpwnam24m)
	    XAUTHORITY	   may be set to a non-standard authority file
	    KRB5CCNAME	   may be set to a Kerberos credentials cache name


       At most installations,  4mXsession24m  should  look  in	$HOME  for  a  file
       4m.xsession,24m	which contains commands that each user would like to use as
       a session.  4mXsession24m should also implement a system default session	 if
       no user-specified session exists.  See the section 1mTypical Usage22m.

       An  argument  may  be  passed  to  this program from the authentication
       widget using the `set-session-argument' action.	This can  be  used  to
       select different styles of session.  One good use of this feature is to
       allow the user to escape from the ordinary session when it fails.  This
       allows  users  to  repair  their	 own  4m.xsession24m  if  it fails, without
       requiring   administrative   intervention.    The   example   following
       demonstrates this feature.

       This example recognizes the special ``failsafe'' mode, specified in the
       translations in the 4mXresources24m file, to  provide  an  escape  from	the
       ordinary	 session.   It	also  requires	that  the  .xsession  file  be
       executable so we don't have to guess what shell it wants to use.

	    #!/bin/sh
	    #
	    # Xsession
	    #
	    # This is the program that is run as the client
	    # for the display manager.

	    case $# in
	    1)
		 case $1 in
		 failsafe)
		      exec xterm -geometry 80x24-0-0
		      ;;
		 esac
	    esac

	    startup=$HOME/.xsession
	    resources=$HOME/.Xresources

	    if [ -f "$startup" ]; then
		 exec "$startup"
	    else
		 if [ -f "$resources" ]; then
		      xrdb -load "$resources"
		 fi
		 twm &
		 xman -geometry +10-10 &
		 exec xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls
	    fi


       The user's 4m.xsession24m file  might  look  something  like  this  example.
       Don't forget that the file must have execute permission.
	    #! /bin/csh
	    # no -f in the previous line so .cshrc gets run to set $PATH
	    twm &
	    xrdb -merge "$HOME/.Xresources"
	    emacs -geometry +0+50 &
	    xbiff -geometry -430+5 &
	    xterm -geometry -0+50 -ls

1mRESET PROGRAM0m
       Symmetrical  with  4mXstartup24m,  the  4mXreset24m  script is run after the user
       session has terminated.	Run as root, it should contain	commands  that
       undo  the  effects  of  commands	 in  4mXstartup,24m  removing  entries from
       4m/etc/utmp24m or unmounting directories from file servers.  The environment
       variables that were passed to 4mXstartup24m are also passed to 4mXreset24m.

       A sample 4mXreset24m script:
	    #!/bin/sh
	    #
	    # Xreset
	    #
	    # This program is run as root after the session ends
	    #
	    sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
	    /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/TakeConsole
	    exit 0

1mCONTROLLING THE SERVER0m
       4mXdm24m	 controls local servers using POSIX signals.  SIGHUP is expected to
       reset the server, closing all client connections and  performing	 other
       cleanup duties.	SIGTERM is expected to terminate the server.  If these
       signals	do  not	 perform   the	 expected   actions,   the   resources
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.resetSignal				       22mand
       1mDisplayManager.4m22mDISPLAY24m1m.termSignal 22mcan specify alternate signals.

       To control remote terminals not using XDMCP, 4mxdm24m  searches	the  window
       hierarchy on the display and uses the protocol request KillClient in an
       attempt to clean up the terminal for the next session.	This  may  not
       actually	 kill  all  of	the  clients, as only those which have created
       windows will be noticed.	 XDMCP provides a more	sure  mechanism;  when
       4mxdm24m closes its initial connection, the session is over and the terminal
       is required to close all other connections.

1mCONTROLLING XDM0m
       4mXdm24m responds to two signals: SIGHUP and SIGTERM.  When sent	 a  SIGHUP,
       4mxdm24m	 rereads  the  configuration file, the access control file, and the
       servers file.  For the servers file, it notices if  entries  have  been
       added  or removed.  If a new entry has been added, 4mxdm24m starts a session
       on the  associated  display.   Entries  which  have  been  removed  are
       disabled	 immediately,  meaning	that  any  session in progress will be
       terminated without notice and no new session will be started.

       When sent a SIGTERM, 4mxdm24m terminates all sessions in progress and exits.
       This can be used when shutting down the system.

       4mXdm24m attempts to mark its various sub-processes for 4mps24m(1) by editing the
       command line argument  list  in	place.	 Because  4mxdm24m  can't  allocate
       additional  space  for  this  task,  it	is  useful to start 4mxdm24m with a
       reasonably long command line  (using  the  full	path  name  should  be
       enough).	 Each process which is servicing a display is marked 1m-4m22mdisplay.0m

1mADDITIONAL LOCAL DISPLAYS0m
       To add an additional local display, add a line for it to	 the  4mXservers0m
       file.  (See the section 1mLocal Server Specification22m.)

       Examine	 the   display-specific	  resources   in   4mxdm-config24m   (e.g.,
       1mDisplayManager._0.authorize22m) and  consider	which  of  them	 should	 be
       copied  for  the	 new  display.	 The  default  4mxdm-config24m	has all the
       appropriate lines for displays 1m:0 22mand 1m:122m.

1mOTHER POSSIBILITIES0m
       You can use 4mxdm24m to run a single session at a time, using the  4.3  4minit0m
       options	or  other  suitable  daemon  by	 specifying  the server on the
       command line:

	    xdm -server ":0 SUN-3/60CG4 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0"


       Or, you might have a file server and a collection of X terminals.   The
       configuration  for  this	 is  identical to the sample above, except the
       4mXservers24m file would look like

	    extol:0 VISUAL-19 foreign
	    exalt:0 NCD-19 foreign
	    explode:0 NCR-TOWERVIEW3000 foreign


       This directs 4mxdm24m to manage sessions on all three  of  these	 terminals.
       See  the	 section 1mControlling Xdm 22mfor a description of using signals to
       enable and disable these terminals in a manner reminiscent of  4minit24m(8).

1mLIMITATIONS0m
       One  thing  that	 4mxdm24m isn't very good at doing is coexisting with other
       window systems.	To use multiple window systems on the  same  hardware,
       you'll probably be more interested in 4mxinit.0m

1mFILES0m
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config0m
			   the default configuration file

       4m$HOME/.Xauthority24m	user  authorization  file where 4mxdm24m stores keys for
			   clients to read

       4mCHOOSERPATH24m		the default chooser

       4m/usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb24m the default resource database loader

       4m/usr/X11R6/bin/X24m	the default server

       1mxdpyinfo 22m[-display	4mdisplayname24m]  [-queryExtensions]  [-ext  4mextension-0m
       4mname24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXdpyinfo24m is a utility for displaying information about an X server.	 It
       is used to examine the capabilities of a server, the predefined	values
       for  various  parameters	 used in communicating between clients and the
       server, and the	different  types  of  screens  and  visuals  that  are
       available.

       By  default, numeric information (opcode, base event, base error) about
       protocol extensions is not displayed.  This information can be obtained
       with  the  1m-queryExtensions 22moption.	 Use of this option on servers that
       dynamically load extensions will likely cause all  possible  extensions
       to  be  loaded,	which  can  be slow and can consume significant server
       resources.

       Detailed information about a particular extension is displayed with the
       1m-ext  4m22mextensionName24m option.  If 4mextensionName24m is 1mall22m, information about
       all extensions supported by both 4mxdpyinfo24m and the server is	 displayed.

1mSYNTAX0m
       1mxedit 22m[ 4m-toolkitoption24m ... ] [ 4mfilename24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXedit24m provides a window consisting of the following four areas:

       Commands Section		A set of  commands  that  allow	 you  to  exit
				4mxedit24m,  save the file, or load a new file into
				the edit window.

       Message Window		Displays 4mxedit24m  messages.	In  addition,  this
				window can be also used as a scratch pad.

       Filename Display		Displays  the name of the file currently being
				edited, and whether this file is 4mRead-Write24m or
				4mRead24m 4mOnly24m.

       Edit Window		Displays  the  text  of	 the file that you are
				editing or creating.

1mLINE EDIT MODE0m
       4mLine24m  4medit24m  4mmode24m	enables	 several  shortcut commands for searching and
       replacing text in a xedit buffer.  4mLine24m 4medit24m  4mmode24m  commands  have  the
       format:

	    [4mline-number24m[,4mline-number24m]]4mcommand24m[4mparameters24m]

       4mLine24m 4mnumber24m may be specified as:

       .       The current text line.

       $       The last line of the file.

       number  The literal line 4mnumber24m.

       - or ^  The previous line. Equivalent to 4m-124m.

       -number or ^number
	       The current line minus 4mnumber24m.

       +       The next line. Equivalent to 4m+124m.

       +number The current line plus 4mnumber24m.

       , or %  From the first to the last line. Equivalent to 4m1,$24m.

       ;       From the current to the last line. Equivalent to 4m.,$24m.


       4mCommand24m may be specified as:

       s       Substitute text in the specified lines.

       /re/    Search forward for the regular expression pattern 4mre24m.

       ?re?    Search backward for the regular expression pattern 4mre24m.


       4mParameters24m may be specified as:

       /re/    Works as a parameter to 4mi24m or as a command.

       /re/text/
	       Search forward for 4mre24m and substitute by 4mtext24m.


       4mOptions24m may follow or be parameters, known values are:

       i       Case insensitive search.

       g       4mGlobal24m  match  when	 replacing text. Unless specified, only the
	       nth, that defaults to 1, match will be replaced.

       c       4mConfirm24m before replacing text.

       number  Replace only the occurrence referenced by 4mnumber24m.


       Commands accept some variations, examples:
	    /pattern/i
	    i/pattern/
	    i/pattern
       Search forward for 4mpattern24m.

	    ,sc/pattern/text
	    ,sc/pattern/text/
	    ,s/pattern/text/c
       Search the entire buffer and ask confirmation to replace	 4mpattern24m  with
       4mtext24m.

	    ,s/pattern/text/number
       Replace	the  match 4mnumber24m in the text line. If not specified, defaults
       to the first occurrence.


       When searching for text, type <Return> to go to the next	 match.	  When
       interactively  replacing	 text, type 4my24m or 4mY24m to accept the change, and 4mn0m
       or 4mN24m to ignore it and go to the next match.


1mCOMMANDS0m
       Quit    Quits the current editing session. If any changes have not been
	       saved,  4mxedit24m  displays a warning message, allowing the user to
	       save them.

       Save    If file backups are enabled (see RESOURCES, below) 4mxedit24m stores
	       a  copy of the original, unedited file in <prefix>4mfile24m<suffix>,
	       then overwrites the 4mfile24m with the contents of the edit  window.
	       The  filename is retrieved from the Text widget directly to the
	       right of the 4mLoad24m button.

       Load    Loads the file named in the  text  widget  immediately  to  the
	       right of the this button and displays it in the Edit window.

XEV(1)									XEV(1)



1mNAME0m
       xev - print contents of X events

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxev   22m[-display   4mdisplayname24m]	  [-geometry  4mgeom24m]  [-bw	4mpixels24m]  [-bs
       4m{NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}24m] [-id 4mwindowid24m] [-s] [-name 4mstring24m] [-rv]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXev24m	 creates  a  window  and  then	asks the X server to send it 4mevents0m
       whenever anything happens to  the  window  (such	 as  it	 being	moved,
       resized,	 typed	in,  clicked  in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an
       existing window.	 It is useful for seeing what causes events  to	 occur
       and  to	display the information that they contain; it is essentially a
       debugging and development tool, and should  not	be  needed  in	normal
       usage.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the X server to contact.

       1m-geometry 4m22mgeom0m
	       This  option  specifies the size and/or location of the window,
	       if a window is to be created.

       1m-bw 4m22mpixels0m
	       This option specifies the border width for the window.

       1m-bs 4m22m{NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}0m
	       This option specifies what kind of backing store	 to  give  the
	       window.	 The default is NotUseful. Backing store refers to the
	       the pixels saved off-screen when the  X	server	maintains  the
	       contents of a window; NotUseful means that the xev process will
	       redraw its contents itself, as necessary.

       1m-id 4m22mwindowid0m
	       This option specifies that the window with the given id	should
	       be monitored, instead of creating a new window.

       1m-s	 22mThis option specifies that save-unders should be enabled on the
	       window. Save unders are similar	to  backing  store,  but  they
	       refer  rather  to  the  saving  of  pixels  off-screen when the
	       current window obscures other windows.  Save  unders  are  only
	       advisory,  and  are  normally  set  for popup dialogs and other
	       transient windows.

       1m-name 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the name to assign to the created window.

       1m-rv	 22mThis  option  specifies  that  the	window should be in reverse
	       video.

XFD(1)									XFD(1)



1mNAME0m
       xfd - display all the characters in an X font

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxfd 22m[-options ...] 1m-fn 4m22mfontname0m

       1mxfd 22m[-options ...] 1m-fa 4m22mfontname0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxfd24m utility creates a window containing the name of the font being
       displayed, a  row  of  command  buttons,	 several  lines	 of  text  for
       displaying character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell.
       The characters are shown in increasing order from left to right, top to
       bottom.	 The  first  character	displayed  at  the  top	 left  will be
       character number 0 unless the 1m-start 22moption has been supplied in  which
       case  the  character with the number given in the 1m-start 22moption will be
       used.

       The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large  enough  to
       hold  any  single character in the font.	 Each character glyph is drawn
       using the PolyText16 request (used by the 4mXlib24m routine  1mXDrawString1622m).
       If  the	1m-box	22moption  is  given, a rectangle will be drawn around each
       character, showing where an  ImageText16	 request  (used	 by  the  4mXlib0m
       routine	 1mXDrawImageString1622m)   would  cause  background  color  to	 be
       displayed.

       The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn
       in  the	upper  left hand corner of the grid cell.  However, if a glyph
       has a negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent,  descent,  or
       right bearing (as is the case with 4mcursor24m font), some character may not
       appear in their own grid cells.	The 1m-center  22moption  may  be  used	 to
       force all glyphs to be centered in their respective cells.

       All  the	 characters in the font may not fit in the window at once.  To
       see the next page of glyphs, press the 4mNext24m button at the  top  of	the
       window.	 To  see  the  previous	 page, press 4mPrev24m.	 To exit 4mxfd24m, press
       4mQuit24m.

       Individual  character  metrics  (index,	width,	bearings,  ascent  and
       descent)	 can  be displayed at the top of the window by clicking on the
       desired character.

       The font name displayed at the top of the window is the	full  name  of
       the  font,  as  determined  by  the  server.   See 4mxlsfonts24m for ways to
       generate lists of fonts, as well as more detailed  summaries  of	 their
       metrics and properties.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mxfd24m accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with
       the additional options listed below:

       1m-fn 4m22mfont0m
	       This option specifies  the  core	 X  server  side  font	to  be
	       displayed.   This  can  also  be	 set  with  the	 FontGrid 1mfont0m
	       resource.  A font must be specified.

       1m-fa 4m22mfont0m
	       This option specifies a Xft font to be displayed. This can also
	       be  set with the FontGrid 1mface 22mresource. A font pattern must be
	       specified.

       1m-box	 22mThis option indicates that a box should be displayed  outlining
	       the  area  that	would  be  filled  with background color by an
	       ImageText request.  This can also  be  set  with	 the  FontGrid
	       1mboxChars 22mresource.	The default is False.

       1m-center 22mThis option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its
	       grid.  This can also  be	 set  with  the	 FontGrid  1mcenterChars0m
	       resource.  The default is False.

       1m-start 4m22mnumber0m
	       This  option  specifies	the glyph index of the upper left hand
	       corner of the  grid.   This  is	used  to  view	characters  at
	       arbitrary locations in the font.	 This can also be set with the
	       FontGrid 1mstartChar 22mresource.  The default is 0.

       1m-bc 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color to be used if  ImageText	 boxes
	       are  drawn.   This  can	also be set with the FontGrid 1mboxColor0m
	       resource.

       1m-rows 4m22mnumrows0m
	       This option specifies the number of rows in the grid.  This can
	       also be set with the FontGrid 1mcellRows 22mresource.

       1m-columns 4m22mnumcols0m
	       This  option specifies the number of columns in the grid.  This
	       can also be set with the FontGrid 1mcellColumns 22mresource.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the	widgets	 which
       compose 4mxfd24m.  In the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
       structure.  The widget class name  is  given  first,  followed  by  the
       widget instance name.  The application class name is Xfd.

       Xfd  xfd

		      Command  prev
		      Command  next
		 Label	select
		 Label	metrics
		 Label	range
		 Label	start
		 Form  form
		      FontGrid	grid

1mFONTGRID RESOURCES0m
       The  FontGrid  widget is an application-specific widget, and a subclass
       of the Simple widget  in	 the  Athena  widget  set.   The  effects  and
       instance	 names	of  this  widget's  resources are given in the 1mOPTIONS0m
       section.	 Capitalize the first letter of the resource instance name  to
       get the corresponding class name.

1mAPPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES0m
       The  instance  names  of	 the  application specific resources are given
       below.  Capitalize the first letter of the resource  instance  name  to
       get  the	 corresponding class name.  These resources are unlikely to be
       interesting unless you are localizing xfd for a different language.

       1mselectFormat0m
	       Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string  used	  to   display
	       information  about  the	selected  character.   The  default is
	       "character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The  arguments  that
	       will  come  after the format string are char.byte1, char.byte2,
	       char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2.	char.byte1  is
	       byte  1 of the selected character.  char.byte2 is byte 2 of the
	       selected character.

       1mmetricsFormat0m
	       Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string  used	  to   display
	       character  metrics.   The  default is "width %d; left %d, right
	       %d; ascent %d, descent %d (font %d, %d)".  The  arguments  that
	       will  come  after  the  format string are the character metrics
	       width, lbearing, rbearing, character ascent, character descent,
	       font ascent, and font descent.

       1mrangeFormat0m
	       Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string  used to display the
	       range of characters currently being displayed.  The default  is
	       "range:	0x%02x%02x  (%u,%u)  thru  0x%02x%02x  (%u,%u)".   The
	       arguments that will  come  after	 the  format  string  are  the
	       following  fields  from	the  XFontStruct that is returned from
	       opening	the  font:  min_byte1,	min_char_or_byte2,  min_byte1,
	       min_char_or_byte2,   max_byte1,	max_char_or_byte2,  max_byte1,
	       max_char_or_byte2.

       1mstartFormat0m
	       Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string  used	  to   display
	       information about the character at the upper left corner of the
	       font grid.  The default is "upper left: 0x%04x  (%d,%d)".   The
	       arguments  that	will  come after the format string are the new
	       character, the high byte of the new character, and the low byte
	       of the new character.

       1mnocharFormat0m
	       Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string  to display when the
	       selected character does not exist.  The	default	 is  "no  such
	       character  0x%02x%02x  (%u,%u)  (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that
	       will come after the format string  are  the  same  as  for  the
	       1mselectFormat 22mresource.

XFINDPROXY(1)							 XFINDPROXY(1)



1mNAME0m
       xfindproxy - locate proxy services

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxfindproxy  -manager  4m22mmanagerAddr24m  1m-name 4m22mserviceName24m 1m-server 4m22mserverAddr0m
       [1m-auth22m] [1m-host 4m22mhostAddr24m] [1m-options 4m22mopts24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mxfindproxy 22mis a program used to locate available  proxy  services.	 It
       utilizes	 the  Proxy  Management	 Protocol  to communicate with a proxy
       manager.	  The  proxy  manager  keeps  track  of	 all  available	 proxy
       services,  starts  new  proxies	when  necessary,  and  makes sure that
       proxies are shared whenever possible.

       The 1m-manager 22margument is required, and it specifies the network address
       of  the	proxy  manager.	  The  format of the address is a standard ICE
       network id (for example, "tcp/blah.x.org:6500").

       The 1m-name 22margument is required,  and  it  specifies	 the  name  of	the
       desired	 proxy	service	 (for  example,	 "LBX").   The	name  is  case
       insensitive.

       The 1m-server 22margument is also required, and it specifies the address	 of
       the  target server.  The format of the address is specific to the proxy
       service specified with the -name argument.  For example,	 for  a	 proxy
       service	of  "LBX",  the	 address  would	 be an X display address (e.g,
       "blah.x.org:0").

       The 1m-auth 22margument is optional.  If specified, xfindproxy will  read  2
       lines	from	standard    input.     The    first    line    is   an
       authorization/authentication   name.    The   second   line   is	   the
       authorization/authentication  data  in hex format (the same format used
       by xauth).  xfindproxy will pass this auth data to the  proxy,  and  in
       most  cases, will be used by the proxy to authorize/authenticate itself
       to the target server.

       The 1m-host 22margument is optional.   If  xfindproxy  starts  a	 new  proxy
       service,	 it  will  pass	 the  host specified.  The proxy may choose to
       restrict all connections to this host.  In the  event  that  xfindproxy
       locates	an  already  existing  proxy, the host will be passed, but the
       semantics of how the proxy uses this host are undefined.

       The 1m-options 22margument is optional.	If xfindproxy starts  a	 new  proxy
       service,	 it  will  pass	 any  options specified.  The semantics of the
       options are specific to each proxy server and are not defined here.  In
       the  event  that	 xfindproxy  locates  an  already  existing proxy, the
       options will be passed, but the semantics of how the proxy  uses	 these
       options are undefined.

       If xfindproxy is successful in obtaining a proxy address, it will print
       it to stdout.  The format of the proxy address is specific to the proxy
       service	being  used.   For  example, for a proxy service of "LBX", the
       proxy address would be  the  X  display	address	 of  the  proxy	 (e.g,
       "blah.x.org:63").

       If  xfindproxy  is  unsuccessful	 in obtaining a proxy address, it will
       print an error to stderr.

XFONTSEL(1)							   XFONTSEL(1)



1mNAME0m
       xfontsel - point and click selection of X11 font names

1mSYNTAX0m
       1mxfontsel 22m[-4mtoolkitoption24m ...]	[1m-pattern  4m22mfontname24m1m]  [-print]  [-sample0m
       4mtext24m1m] [-sample16 4m22mtext1624m1m] [-sampleUCS 4m22mtextUCS24m1m] [-scaled]0m


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxfontsel24m  application	provides  a simple way to display the fonts
       known to your X server, examine samples of each,	 and  retrieve	the  X
       Logical Font Description ("XLFD") full name for a font.

       If 1m-pattern 22mis not specified, all fonts with XLFD 14-part names will be
       selectable.  To work with only a subset of the fonts, specify  1m-pattern0m
       followed	 by a partially or fully qualified font name; e.g., ``-pattern
       *medium*'' will select that subset of fonts which  contain  the	string
       ``medium''  somewhere  in  their	 font name.  Be careful about escaping
       wildcard characters in your shell.

       If 1m-print 22mis specified on the command line the selected font  specifier
       will  be	 written to standard output when the 4mquit24m button is activated.
       Regardless of whether or not 1m-print 22mwas specified, the  font  specifier
       may  be	made  the  PRIMARY  (text)  selection by activating the 4mselect0m
       button.

       The 1m-sample 22moption specifies the sample text to be used to display	the
       selected	 font if the font is linearly indexed, overriding the default.

       The 1m-sample16 22moption specifies the sample text to be  used	to  display
       the  selected  font  if	the  font  is  matrix  encoded, overriding the
       default.

       The 1m-sampleUCS 22moption specifies the sample text encoded  in	 the  UTF-8
       form  to	 be  used  to  display	the  selected  font  if the font has a
       CHARSET_REGISTRY of ISO10646, overriding the default.

       The 1m-scaled 22moption enables	the  ability  to  select  scaled  fonts	 at
       arbitrary pixel or point sizes.


1mINTERACTIONS0m
       Clicking	 any pointer button in one of the XLFD field names will pop up
       a menu  of  the	currently-known	 possibilities	for  that  field.   If
       previous choices of other fields were made, only values for fonts which
       matched the previously selected fields  will  be	 selectable;  to  make
       other  values  selectable,  you	must  deselect	some other field(s) by
       choosing the ``*'' entry in that field.	 Unselectable  values  may  be
       omitted	from  the  menu	 entirely  as  a configuration option; see the
       1mShowUnselectable 22mresource, below.  Whenever any change  is	made  to  a
       field  value,  4mxfontsel24m  will  assert  ownership  of  the  PRIMARY_FONT
       selection.  Other applications (see, e.g., 4mxterm24m) may then retrieve the
       selected font specification.

       Scalable	 fonts come back from the server with zero for the pixel size,
       point size, and average width fields.  Selecting a  font	 name  with  a
       zero  in	 these	positions results in an implementation-dependent size.
       Any pixel or point size	can  be	 selected  to  scale  the  font	 to  a
       particular  size.   Any average width can be selected to anamorphically
       scale the font (although you may find this challenging given  the  size
       of the average width menu).

       Clicking	 the  left  pointer button in the 4mselect24m widget will cause the
       currently selected font name to become the PRIMARY  text	 selection  as
       well  as the PRIMARY_FONT selection.  This then allows you to paste the
       string into other applications.	The 1mselect 22mbutton remains	highlighted
       to  remind  you	of  this  fact,	 and  de-highlights  when  some	 other
       application takes the PRIMARY selection away.  The 4mselect24m widget  is  a
       toggle;	pressing  it  when  it	is  highlighted will cause 4mxfontsel24m to
       release	the  selection	ownership   and	  de-highlight	 the   widget.
       Activating the 4mselect24m widget twice is the only way to cause 4mxfontsel24m to
       release the PRIMARY_FONT selection.


1mRESOURCES0m
       The application class is	 1mXFontSel22m.	  Most	of  the	 user-interface	 is
       configured  in the app-defaults file; if this file is missing a warning
       message will be printed to standard output  and	the  resulting	window
       will be nearly incomprehensible.

       Most of the significant parts of the widget hierarchy are documented in
       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XFontSel24m,

       Application specific resources:


       1mcursor (22mclass 1mCursor)0m
	       Specifies the cursor for the application window.

       1mpattern (22mclass 1mPattern)0m
	       Specifies the font name	pattern	 for  selecting	 a  subset  of
	       available  fonts.   Equivalent  to  the	1m-pattern 22moption.  Most
	       useful patterns will contain at least one field delimiter; e.g.
	       ``*-m-*'' for monospaced fonts.

       1mpixelSizeList (22mclass 1mPixelSizeList)0m
	       Specifies  a list of pixel sizes to add to the pixel size menu,
	       so that scalable fonts can be selected at  those	 pixel	sizes.
	       The default pixelSizeList contains 7, 30, 40, 50, and 60.

       1mpointSizeList (22mclass 1mPointSizeList)0m
	       Specifies  a list of point sizes (in units of tenths of points)
	       to add to the point size menu, so that scalable	fonts  can  be
	       selected	 at  those  point  sizes.   The	 default pointSizeList
	       contains 250, 300, 350, and 400.

       1mprintOnQuit (22mclass 1mPrintOnQuit)0m
	       If 4mTrue24m the currently selected font name is printed to standard
	       output  when  the  quit button is activated.  Equivalent to the
	       1m-print 22moption.

       1msampleText (22mclass 1mText)0m
	       The sample 1-byte text to use for linearly indexed fonts.  Each
	       glyph index is a single byte, with newline separating lines.

       1msampleText16 (22mclass 1mText16)0m
	       The  sample  2-byte text to use for matrix-encoded fonts.  Each
	       glyph index is two bytes,  with	a  1-byte  newline  separating
	       lines.

       1mscaledFonts (22mclass 1mScaledFonts)0m
	       If  4mTrue24m  then selection of arbitrary pixel and point sizes for
	       scalable fonts is enabled.

       Widget specific resources:


       1mshowUnselectable (22mclass 1mShowUnselectable)0m
	       Specifies, for each field menu, whether or not to  show	values
	       that  are  not  currently selectable, based upon previous field
	       selections.  If shown,  the  unselectable  values  are  clearly
	       identified  as  such  and  do not highlight when the pointer is
	       moved down the  menu.   The  full  name	of  this  resource  is
	       1mfieldN.menu.options.showUnselectable22m,		      class
	       1mMenuButton.SimpleMenu.Options.ShowUnselectable22m;  where   N	 is
	       replaced	 with  the  field  number (starting with the left-most
	       field numbered 0).  The default is True for all	but  field  11
	       (average	 width	of characters in font) and False for field 11.
	       If   you	  never	  want	 to    see    unselectable    entries,
	       '*menu.options.showUnselectable:False' is a reasonable thing to
	       specify in a resource file.

1mBUGS0m
       Sufficiently ambiguous patterns can be misinterpreted and  lead	to  an
       initial	selection  string  which  may  not correspond to what the user
       intended and which may cause the initial sample text output to fail  to
       match the proffered string.  Selecting any new field value will correct
       the sample output, though possibly resulting in no matching font.

       Should be able to return a FONT for the PRIMARY selection, not  just  a
       STRING.

       Any  change in a field value will cause 4mxfontsel24m to assert ownership of
       the PRIMARY_FONT selection.  Perhaps this should be parameterized.

       When running on a slow machine, it is possible for the user to  request
       a  field	 menu  before  the font names have been completely parsed.  An
       error message indicating a  missing  menu  is  printed  to  stderr  but
       otherwise nothing bad (or good) happens.

       The average-width menu is too large to be useful.

1mNAME0m
       xfs - X font server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxfs   22m[-config   4mconfiguration_file24m]	[-daemon]    [-droppriv]    [-ls
       4mlisten_socket24m] [-nodaemon] [-port 4mtcp_port24m] [-user 4musername24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXfs24m	 is the X Window System font server.  It supplies fonts to X Window
       System display servers.

1mSTARTING THE SERVER0m
       The server is usually run by a system administrator,  and  started  via
       boot  files  like  4m/etc/rc.local24m.  Users may also wish to start private
       font servers for specific sets of fonts.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-config configuration_file0m
	       Specifies the configuration file the font server will use.   If
	       this   parameter	  is   not   specified,	  the	default	 file,
	       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fs/config24m will be used.

       1m-ls listen_socket0m
	       Specifies a file descriptor which is already set up to be  used
	       as  the listen socket.  This option is only intended to be used
	       by the font server itself when automatically  spawning  another
	       copy of itself to handle additional connections.

       1m-port tcp_port0m
	       Specifies  the  TCP port number on which the server will listen
	       for connections.	 The default port number is 7100.

       1m-daemon 22mInstructs xfs to fork and go into the background  automatically
	       at  startup  If this option is not specified, xfs will run as a
	       regular process (unless xfs was built to daemonize by default).

       1m-droppriv0m
	       If  specified,  xfs  will  attempt to run as user and group 4mxfs0m
	       (unless the 1m-user 22moption is used). This  has  been	implemented
	       for  security  reasons,	as  xfs	 may  have undiscovered buffer
	       overflows or other paths for possible exploit, both  local  and
	       remote.	 With  this  option, you may also wish to specify "no-
	       listen = tcp" in the config file, which ensures that  xfs  will
	       not to use a TCP port at all.

       1m-nodaemon0m
	       When  xfs  is  built  to	 daemonize  (run in the background) by
	       default, this prevents that and starts  xfs  up	as  a  regular
	       process.

       1m-user username0m
	       This  is	 equivalent  to	 1m-droppriv 22mexcept that xfs will run as
	       user 4musername24m.

1mSIGNALS0m
       4mSIGTERM24m This causes the font server to exit cleanly.

       4mSIGUSR124m This signal	 is  used  to  cause  the  server  to  re-read	its
	       configuration file.

       4mSIGUSR224m This  signal  is  used  to cause the server to flush any cached
	       data it may have.

       4mSIGHUP24m  This signal is used to cause the server to reset,  closing	all
	       active connections and re-reading the configuration file.

1mCONFIGURATION0m
       The  configuration language is a list of keyword and value pairs.  Each
       keyword is followed by an '=' and then the desired value.

       Recognized keywords include:


       catalogue (list of string)
	      Ordered list of font path element names.	 Use  of  the  keyword
	      "catalogue"   is	 very	misleading  at	present,  the  current
	      implementation  only  supports  a	 single	  catalogue   ("all"),
	      containing all of the specified fonts.

       alternate-servers (list of string)
	      List of alternate servers for this font server.

       client-limit (cardinal)
	      Number  of clients this font server will support before refusing
	      service.	This is useful for tuning the load on each  individual
	      font server.

       clone-self (boolean)
	      Whether  this font server should attempt to clone itself when it
	      reachs the client-limit.

       default-point-size (cardinal)
	      The default pointsize  (in  decipoints)  for  fonts  that	 don't
	      specify.	The default is 120.

       default-resolutions (list of resolutions)
	      Resolutions  the	server	supports by default.  This information
	      may be used as a hint for	 pre-rendering,	 and  substituted  for
	      scaled fonts which do not specify a resolution.  A resolution is
	      a comma-separated pair of x and  y  resolutions  in  pixels  per
	      inch.  Multiple resolutions are separated by commas.

       error-file (string)
	      Filename	of  the	 error	file.  All warnings and errors will be
	      logged here.

       no-listen (trans-type)
	      Disable a transport  type. For example, TCP/IP  connections  can
	      be disabled with no-listen tcp

       port (cardinal)
	      TCP port on which the server will listen for connections.

       use-syslog (boolean)
	      Whether  syslog(3)  (on  supported  systems)  is	to be used for
	      errors.

       deferglyphs (string)
	      Set the mode for delayed fetching and caching of glyphs.	 Value
	      is  "none",  meaning deferred glyphs is disabled, "all", meaning
	      it is enabled for all fonts, and "16",  meaning  it  is  enabled
	      only for 16-bits fonts.

1mFONT SERVER NAMES0m
       One  of	the  following	forms  can  be used to name a font server that
       accepts TCP connections:

	   tcp/4mhostname24m:4mport0m
	   tcp/4mhostname24m:4mport24m/4mcataloguelist0m

       The 4mhostname24m specifies the name (or decimal	 numeric  address)  of	the
       machine	on  which the font server is running.  The 4mport24m is the decimal
       TCP port on which the font server is listening  for  connections.   The
       4mcataloguelist24m  specifies  a	 list  of  catalogue  names,  with '+' as a
       separator.

       Examples: 4mtcp/fs.x.org:710024m, 4mtcp/18.30.0.212:7101/all24m.

       One of the following forms can be used  to  name	 a  font  server  that
       accepts DECnet connections:

	   decnet/4mnodename24m::font$4mobjname0m
	   decnet/4mnodename24m::font$4mobjname24m/4mcataloguelist0m

       The  4mnodename24m  specifies  the  name (or decimal numeric address) of the
       machine on which the font server is running.  The 4mobjname24m is a  normal,
       case-insensitive	 DECnet	 object	 name.	 The 4mcataloguelist24m specifies a
       list of catalogue names, with '+' as a separator.

       Examples:				  4mDECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT24m,
       4mdecnet/44.70::font$special/symbols24m.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxfwp 22m[option ...]


1mCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS0m
       The command line options that can be specified are:


       1m-cdt 4m22mnum_secs0m
	       Used to override the default time-to-close (604800 seconds) for
	       xfwp  client  data  connections	on  which there is no activity
	       (connections over which X protocol is already being relayed  by
	       xfwp)


       1m-clt 4m22mnum_secs0m
	       Used  to override the default time-to-close (86400 seconds) for

	       Used  to	 override the default time-to-close (3600 seconds) for
	       Proxy Manager connections on which there is no activity


       1m-config 4m22mfile_name0m
	       Used to specify the configuration the name of the configuration
	       file


       1m-pmport 4m22mport_number0m
	       Used  to	 override  the	default	 port address (4444) for proxy
	       manager connections


       1m-verify 22mUsed to display the configuration file rule that  was  actually
	       matched for each service request


       1m-logfile 4m22mfile_name0m
	       Used  to	 specify  the  name  of a file where audit information

	       day; event code; source IP address; destination IP address; and
	       configuration rule number.  The event  codes  are:  "0"	for  a
	       successful connection; "1" if a connection is denied because of
	       a configuration rule; and "2" if a connection is denied because
	       of  an  authorization failure.  If the event code is "1", and a
	       configuration file is used, the configuration  rule  number  is
	       the  line  number of the configuration file where the match was
	       made (see the section CONFIGURATION FILE for more information).
	       If  the	event  code is not "1", or if no configuration file is

	       Used  to	 specify  the  maximum number of X server connections.
	       The default is 100.


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The X firewall proxy (xfwp) is an application layer gateway proxy  that
       may  be	run on a network firewall host to forward X traffic across the
       firewall.  Used in conjunction with the X server Security extension and
       authorization  checking,	 xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, and reliable
       mechanism both to hide the  addresses  of  X  servers  located  on  the
       Intranet	 and  to  enforce  a  server  connection  policy.  Xfwp cannot
       protect against mischief originating on	the  Intranet;	however,  when
       properly	  configured  it  can  guarantee  that	only  trusted  clients
       originating on authorized  external  Internet  hosts  will  be  allowed
       inbound access to local X servers.

       To  use	xfwp  there  must  be  an X proxy manager running in the local
       environment which has been configured at start-up to know the  location
       of  the	xfwp.	[NOTE:	 There	may be more than one xfwp running in a
       local environment; see  notes  below  on	 load  balancing  for  further
       discussion.]   Using  the xfindproxy utility (which relays its requests
       through the proxy manager) a user asks xfwp to allocate a client listen
       port for a particular X server, which is internally associated with all
       future connection requests for that server.  This  client  listen  port
       address	is returned by the proxy manager through xfindproxy.  The xfwp
       hostname and port number is then passed out-of-band (i.e.,  via	a  Web
       browser)	 to  some  remote X client, which will subsequently connect to
       xfwp instead of to the target X server.

       When an X client connection request appears on  one  of	xfwp's	listen
       ports,  xfwp  connects to the X server associated with this listen port
       and performs authorization checks against the server as well as against
       its  own	 configurable  access control list for requesting clients.  If
       these checks fail, or if the requested server does not  support	the  X
       Security	 Extension,  the client connection is refused.	Otherwise, the
       connection is accepted and all ensuing data between client  and	server
       is  relayed  by	xfwp until the client terminates the connection or, in
       the case of an inactive client, until a configured  timeout  period  is
       exceeded.   Xfwp is designed to block while waiting for activity on its
       connections, thereby minimizing demand for system cycles.

       If xfwp is run without a configuration file and thus no	sitepolicy  is
       defined,	 if  xfwp  is  using an X server where xhost + has been run to
       turn off host-based  authorization  checks,  when  a  client  tries  to
       connect	to  this  X  server  via  xfwp,	 the  X	 server	 will deny the
       connection.   If	 xfwp  does  not  define  a   sitepolicy,   host-based
       authorization  must  be turned on for clients to connect to an X server
       via the xfwp.


1mINTEROPERATION WITH IP PACKET-FILTERING ROUTERS0m
       The whole purpose of the xfwp  is  to  provide  reliable	 control  over
       access  to  Intranet  X	servers	 by  clients  originating  outside the
       firewall.  At the  present  time,  such	access	control	 is  typically
       achieved	 by  firewall configurations incorporating IP packet-filtering
       routers.	 Frequently, the rules for  such  filters  deny	 access	 to  X
       server ports (range 6000 - 6xxx) for all Intranet host machines.

       In  order for xfwp to do its job, restrictions on access for ports 6001
       - 6xxx must be removed from the rule-base of  the  IP  packet-filtering
       router.	 [NOTE:	 xfwp  only  assigns ports in the range beginning with
       6001; access to port 6000 on all Intranet  hosts	 may  continue	to  be
       denied.]	  This	does not mean the Intranet firewall will be opened for
       indiscriminate entry by X clients.   Instead,  xfwp  supports  a	 fully
       configurable  rule-based	 access control system, similar to that of the
       IP packet-filter router itself.	Xfwp in effect adds another  level  of
       packet-filtering	 control  which	 is  fully  configurable  and  applies
       specifically to X traffic.  See section	entitled  CONFIGURATION	 FILE,
       below, for further details.


1mINSTALLATION, SETUP AND TROUBLESHOOTING0m
       Xfwp  is typically run as a background process on the Intranet firewall
       host.  It can  be  launched  using  any	of  the	 command-line  options
       described  above.   As noted above, xfwp works only in conjunction with
       proxy manager and the xfindproxy utility.  It can also be configured to
       support	a  user-defined	 X server site security policy, in which the X
       server is required to indicate to xfwp whether or not it	 supports  the
       particular  policy.   Consult  the  X  server  man  pages  for  further
       information on these components.	 Xfwp diagnostics can be turned on  by
       compiling  with	the -DDEBUG switch.  Connection status can be recorded
       by using the -logfile and -loglevel command line options.


1mPERFORMANCE, LOAD BALANCING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT0m
       Xfwp manages four different kinds of connections:  proxy	 manager  (PM)
       data,  X	 client	 listen,  X  client  data, and X server.  The sysadmin
       employing xfwp must understand how the  resources  for  each  of	 these
       connection  types  are  allocated  and  reclaimed  by  xfwp in order to
       optimize the availability of xfwp service.

       Each connection-type has a default number of  allocation	 slots	and  a
       default timeout.	 The number of allocation slots for PM connections and
       X  server  connections  is  configurable	 via  command  line   options.
       Connection  timeouts  are  also	configurable via command line options.
       Each connection timeout represents the period the  connection  will  be
       allowed	to  remain  open  in  the  absence  of	any  activity  on that
       connection.  Whenever there is activity on a connection,	 the  time-to-
       close  is  automatically	 reset.	  The  default	distribution  of total
       process connection slots across the four connection types, as  well  as
       the choice of default timeouts for the connection types, is governed by
       a number of assumptions embedded in the xfwp use model.


       The default number of PM connections is 10 and the default duration for
       PM connections is 3,600 seconds (1 hour) for each connection after time
       of last activity.  At start-up, xfwp listens for PM connection requests
       on  any non-reserved port (default of 4444 if not specified on the xfwp
       command-line).  The PM normally connects to xfwp only when  a  call  is
       made  to	 the PM with xfindproxy.  Thereafter, the PM remains connected
       to xfwp, even after the messaging between them has been completed,  for
       the  default connection duration period.	 In some cases this may result
       in depletion of available PM connection slots.  If the sysadmin expects
       connections  to	a  single  xfwp from many PM's, xfwp should be started
       using the -pdt command line option, with a timeout value reflecting the
       desired	duration that inactive connections will be permitted to remain
       open.

       Xfwp client listeners are set up by a call to xfindproxy	 and  continue
       to  listen  for	X client connection requests for a default duration of
       86,400 seconds (24 hours) from the point of last activity.  After  this
       time  they are automatically closed and their fd's recovered for future
       allocation.   In	 addressing  the  question  of	how  to	 choose	  some
       alternative  timeout  value  which  will	 guarantee the availability of
       client listen ports,  sysadmins	should	take  into  consideration  the
       expected	 delay between the time when the listener was allocated (using
       xfindproxy) and the time when a client actually attempts to connect  to
       xfwp,  as  well	the  likelihood	 that client listeners will be re-used
       after the initial client data connection is closed.

       Each client connection is  allocated  a	default	 lifetime  of  604,800
       seconds (7 * 24 hours) from the point when it last saw activity.	 After
       this time it is automatically closed and its fd's recovered for	future
       allocation.   Because  server  connections are not actually established
       until a connection request from a remote X client arrives at one of the
       xfwp's  client  listen  ports,  the client data timeout applies both to
       client-xfwp connections as well as to xfwp-server connections.  If  the
       system administrator expects many client data connections through xfwp,
       an overriding of the default timeout should be considered.


1mCONFIGURATION FILE0m
       The xfwp configuration file resides on the xfwp	host  machine  and  is
       used  to	 determine  whether  X client data connection requests will be
       permitted or denied.  The path to the file  is  specified  at  start-up
       time.   If  no  configuration  file  is	specified,  all	 X client data
       connection requests routed through xfwp will be by  default  permitted,
       assuming that other X server authorization checks are successful.  If a
       configuration file is supplied but none	of  its	 entries  matches  the
       connection request then the connection is by default denied.

       If  a line in the configuration file begins with the '#' character or a
       new-line character, the line is ignored and the evaluator will skip the
       line.

       The  configuration file supports two entirely independent authorization
       checks:	one which is performed by xfwp itself, and a second  which  is
       the  result  of	xfwp's querying the target X server.  For the first of
       these, the configuration file employs a syntax and semantic similar  to
       that  of IP packet-filtering routers.  It contains zero or more source-
       destination rules of the following form:

       {permit | deny}	<src>  <src  mask>  [<dest>  <dest  mask>  [<operator>
       <service>]]


       permit/deny the	keywords  ``permit''  or ``deny'' indicate whether the
		   rule will enable or disable access, respectively

       src	   the	IP  address  against  the  host	 who  originated   the
		   connection  request will be matched, expressed in IP format
		   (x.x.x.x)

       src mask	   a subnet mask, also in IP format,  for  further  qualifying
		   the source mask.  Bits set in the mask indicate bits of the
		   incoming address  to	 be  4mignored24m  when	 comparing  to	the
		   specified src

       dest	   the	IP  address  against  which  the  destination  of  the
		   incoming connection request (i.e. the  host	IP  of	the  X
		   server  to  which  the  incoming  client  is	 attempting to
		   connect) will be matched

       dest mask   a subnet mask, also in IP format,  for  further  qualifying
		   the	destination  mask.  Bits set in the mask indicate bits
		   of the destination address to be 4mignored24m when comparing	 to
		   the specified dest

       operator	   always ``eq'' (if the service field is not NULL)

       service	   one	of  the	 following  three strings:  ``pm'', ``fp'', or
		   ``cd'', corresponding  to  proxy  manager,  xfindproxy,  or
		   client data, respectively

       For  the	 second	 type  of  authorization check, the configuration file
       contains zero or more site policy rules of the following form:

       {require | disallow} sitepolicy <site_policy>


       require	   specifies that the X server	4mmust24m  be  configured  with	 4mat0m
		   4mleast24m  4mone24m of the corresponding site policies, else it must
		   refuse the connection.

       disallow	   specifies that the X server 4mmust24m 4mnot24m be configured with 4many0m
		   of the corresponding site policies, else it must refuse the
		   connection.

       sitepolicy  a required keyword

       <site_policy>
		   specifies the policy string.	 The string  may  contain  any
		   combination	of  alphanumeric  characters  subject  only to
		   interpretation by the target X server


1mRULES FOR EVALUATING THE XFWP CONFIGURATION FILE ENTRIES0m
       For the first type of configurable authorization checking,  access  can
       be  permitted or denied for each connection type based upon source and,
       optionally, destination and service.  Each file entry must at a minimum
       specify	the  keyword ``permit'' or ``deny'' and the two source fields.
       The destination and service fields can be used to provide finer-grained
       access control if desired.

       The algorithm for rule-matching is as follows:

	    while (more entries to check)
	    {
	      if ((<originator IP> AND (NOT <src mask>)) == src)
		[if ((<dest X server IP> AND (NOT <dest mask>)) == dest)]
		  [if (service fields present and matching)]
		    do either permit or deny connection depending on keyword
	      else
		continue
	    }
	    if (no rule matches)
	      deny connection

       If a permit or deny rule does not specify a service and operation, then
       the rule applies to all services.  If a configuration file is specified
       and  it	contains  at  least one valid deny or permit rule, then a host
       that is not explicitly permitted will be denied a connection.

       Site policy configuration checking constitutes a separate (and X server
       only)  authorization check on incoming connection requests.  Any number
       of require or disallow rules may be specified, but all rules must be of
       the same type; that is, a single rule file cannot have both ``require''
       and ``disallow'' keywords.  The algorithm for this check is as follows:

	    if (X server recognizes any of the site policy strings)
	      if (keyword == require)
		permit connection
	      else
		deny connection
	    else
	      if (keyword == require)
		deny connection
	      else
		permit connection

       The  site  policy  check	 is  performed	by  xfwp  only	if the source-
       destination rules permit the connection.


1mEXAMPLES0m

       # if and only if server supports one of these policies then authorize
       # connections, but still subject to applicable rule matches
       #
       require sitepolicy policy1
       require sitepolicy policy2
       #
       # deny pm connections originating on 8.7.6.5 [NOTE:  If pm service
       # is explicitly qualified, line must include destination fields as
       # shown.]
       #
       deny  8.7.6.5  0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0	255.255.255.255	 eq  pm
       #
       # permit xfindproxy X server connects to anywhere [NOTE:	 If
       # fp service is explicitly qualified, line must include source fields
       # as shown.]
       #
       permit  0.0.0.0	255.255.255.255	  0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255  eq	fp
       #
       # permit all connection types originating from the 192.0.0.0
       # IP domain only
       #
       permit  192.0.0.0   0.255.255.255


       Care should be taken that source-destination rules are written  in  the
       correct order, as the first matching rule will be applied.  In addition
       to parser syntax checking, a special command-line switch (-verify)  has
       been  provided  to  assist  the	sysadmin in determining which rule was
       actually matched.

XHOST(1)							      XHOST(1)



1mNAME0m
       xhost - server access control program for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxhost 22m[[+-]name ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxhost24m program is used to add and delete host names or user names to
       the list allowed to make connections to the X server.  In the  case  of
       hosts,  this  provides  a  rudimentary  form  of	 privacy  control  and
       security.  It is	 only  sufficient  for	a  workstation	(single	 user)
       environment,  although  it  does	 limit the worst abuses.  Environments
       which require more sophisticated measures should	 implement  the	 user-
       based  mechanism	 or  use  the  hooks in the protocol for passing other
       authentication data to the server.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXhost24m accepts the following command line options described below.	For
       security,  the  options that effect access control may only be run from
       the "controlling host".	For workstations, this is the same machine  as
       the server.  For X terminals, it is the login host.

       1m-help	 22mPrints a usage message.

       1m[+]4m22mname24m The given 4mname24m (the plus sign is optional) is added to the list
	       allowed to connect to the X server.  The name  can  be  a  host
	       name or a user name.

       1m-4m22mname24m	 The  given  4mname24m is removed from the list of allowed to connect
	       to the server.  The name can be a host name  or	a  user	 name.
	       Existing	  connections  are  not	 broken,  but  new  connection
	       attempts will be denied.	 Note  that  the  current  machine  is
	       allowed	to be removed; however, further connections (including
	       attempts to add it back) will not be permitted.	Resetting  the
	       server  (thereby	 breaking  all connections) is the only way to
	       allow local connections again.

       1m+	 22mAccess is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the  list
	       (i.e., access control is turned off).

       1m-	 22mAccess  is	restricted  to only those on the list (i.e., access
	       control is turned on).

       4mnothing24m If no command line arguments are given,  a	message	 indicating
	       whether	or not access control is currently enabled is printed,
	       followed by the list of those allowed to connect.  This is  the
	       only  option  that  may	be  used  from machines other than the
	       controlling host.

1mNAMES0m
       A complete name has the syntax ``family:name'' where the	 families  are
       as follows:

       inet	 Internet host (IPv4)
       inet6	 Internet host (IPv6)
       dnet	 DECnet host
       nis	 Secure RPC network name
       krb	 Kerberos V5 principal
       local	 contains only one name, the empty string

       The family is case insensitive.	The format of the name varies with the
       family.

       When Secure RPC is being used, the network independent  netname	(e.g.,
       "nis:unix.4muid24m@4mdomainname24m")  can  be  specified,  or a local user can be
       specified  with	just  the  username  and  a  trailing  at-sign	(e.g.,
       "nis:pat@").

       For backward compatibility with pre-R6 4mxhost24m, names that contain an at-
       sign (@) are assumed to be in  the  nis	family.	  Otherwise  they  are
       assumed to be Internet addresses. If compiled to support IPv6, then all
       IPv4 and IPv6 addresses returned by getaddrinfo(3)  are	added  to  the
       access list in the appropriate inet or inet6 family.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       For  each  name	added  to  the access control list, a line of the form
       "4mname24m being added to access control list" is printed.   For	 each  name
       removed	from  the  access control list, a line of the form "4mname24m being
       removed from access control list" is printed.

       The X server stores network addresses, not host	names.	 This  is  not
       really a bug.  If somehow you change a host's network address while the
       server is still running, 4mxhost24m must be used	 to  add  the  new  address
       and/or remove the old address.

XINIT(1)							      XINIT(1)



1mNAME0m
       xinit - X Window System initializer

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxinit 22m[ [ 4mclient24m ] 4moptions24m ] [ 1m-- 22m[ 4mserver24m ] [ 4mdisplay24m ] 4moptions24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxinit24m	program	 is  used to start the X Window System server and a
       first client program on systems	that  cannot  start  X	directly  from
       4m/etc/init24m  or  in  environments that use multiple window systems.  When
       this first client  exits,  4mxinit24m  will  kill  the  X  server  and  then
       terminate.

       If  no specific client program is given on the command line, 4mxinit24m will
       look for a file in the user's home directory called 4m.xinitrc24m to run	 as
       a  shell	 script	 to start up client programs.  If no such file exists,
       4mxinit24m will use the following as a default:

	    xterm  -geometry  +1+1  -n	login  -display	 :0


       If no specific server program is given on the command line, 4mxinit24m  will
       look  for  a file in the user's home directory called 4m.xserverrc24m to run
       as a shell script to start up the server.   If  no  such	 file  exists,
       4mxinit24m will use the following as a default:

	    X  :0

       Note  that  this assumes that there is a program named 4mX24m in the current
       search path.  However, servers are  usually  named  4mXdisplaytype24m  where
       4mdisplaytype24m	 is  the  type	of graphics display which is driven by this
       server.	The site administrator should, therefore, make a link  to  the
       appropriate  type  of  server  on the machine, or create a shell script
       that runs 4mxinit24m with the appropriate server.

       Note, when using a 4m.xserverrc24m script be sure to  ``exec''  the  real  X
       server.	 Failing  to  do  this can make the X server slow to start and
       exit.  For example:

	    exec Xdisplaytype

       An important point is that programs which are run by 4m.xinitrc24m should be
       run  in	the  background	 if  they do not exit right away, so that they
       don't prevent other programs from starting up.  However, the last long-
       lived  program  started (usually a window manager or terminal emulator)
       should be left in the foreground so that the script won't  exit	(which
       indicates that the user is done and that 4mxinit24m should exit).

       An alternate client and/or server may be specified on the command line.
       The desired client program and its arguments should  be	given  as  the
       first  command line arguments to 4mxinit24m.  To specify a particular server
       command line, append a double dash  (--)	 to  the  4mxinit24m  command  line
       (after  any  client  and	 arguments)  followed  by  the	desired server
       command.

       Both the client program name and the server  program  name  must	 begin
       with  a	slash  (/) or a period (.).  Otherwise, they are treated as an
       arguments to be appended to their respective startup lines.  This makes
       it  possible  to	 add arguments (for example, foreground and background
       colors) without having to retype the whole command line.

       If an explicit  server  name  is	 not  given  and  the  first  argument
       following  the  double  dash (--) is a colon followed by a digit, 4mxinit0m
       will use that number as	the  display  number  instead  of  zero.   All
       remaining arguments are appended to the server command line.


1mEXAMPLES0m
       Below  are  several examples of how command line arguments in 4mxinit24m are
       used.

       1mxinit	 22mThis will start  up	 a  server  named  4mX24m  and	run  the  user's
	       4m.xinitrc24m, if it exists, or else start an 4mxterm24m.

       1mxinit -- /usr/X11R6/bin/Xqdss	:10m
	       This  is	 how  one  could start a specific type of server on an
	       alternate display.

       1mxinit -geometry =80x65+10+10 -fn 8x13 -j -fg white -bg navy0m
	       This will start up a server named 4mX24m, and will append the  given
	       arguments  to  the  default  4mxterm24m	command.   It  will  ignore
	       4m.xinitrc24m.

       1mxinit -e widgets -- ./Xsun -l -c0m
	       This will use the command 4m.Xsun24m 4m-l24m 4m-c24m to start the  server  and
	       will  append  the  arguments  4m-e24m  4mwidgets24m  to the default 4mxterm0m
	       command.

       1mxinit /usr/ucb/rsh fasthost cpupig -display ws:1 --  :1 -a 2 -t 50m
	       This will start	a  server  named  4mX24m  on  display  1  with	the
	       arguments  4m-a24m 4m224m 4m-t24m 4m524m.  It will then start a remote shell on the
	       machine 1mfasthost 22min which  it  will	 run  the  command  4mcpupig24m,
	       telling it to display back on the local workstation.

       Below  is a sample 4m.xinitrc24m that starts a clock, several terminals, and
       leaves  the  window  manager  running  as  the  ``last''	  application.
       Assuming that the window manager has been configured properly, the user
       then chooses the ``Exit'' menu item to shut down X.

	       xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources
	       xsetroot -solid gray &
	       xclock -g 50x50-0+0 -bw 0 &
	       xload -g 50x50-50+0 -bw 0 &
	       xterm -g 80x24+0+0 &
	       xterm -g 80x24+0-0 &
	       twm

       Sites that want to create a common  startup  environment	 could	simply
       create a default 4m.xinitrc24m that references a site-wide startup file:

	       #!/bin/sh
	       . /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc

       Another approach is to write a script that starts 4mxinit24m with a specific
       shell script.  Such scripts are usually named 4mx1124m,	4mxstart24m,  or  4mstartx0m
       and  are	 a  convenient	way  to	 provide a simple interface for novice
       users:

	       #!/bin/sh
	       xinit /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc -- /usr/X11R6/bin/X bc


1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES0m
       1mDISPLAY	22mThis variable gets set to the name  of  the	display	 to

XKBCOMP(1)							    XKBCOMP(1)



1mNAME0m
       xkbcomp - compile XKB keyboard description

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxkbcomp 22m[option] source [ destination ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxkbcomp24m  keymap  compiler  converts a description of an XKB keymap
       into one of several output formats.   The most common use  for  xkbcomp
       is  to create a compiled keymap file (.xkm extension) which can be read
       directly by XKB-capable X servers or utilities.	 The  keymap  compiler
       can  also  produce  C  header  files or XKB source files.  The C header
       files produced by xkbcomp can be included by  X	servers	 or  utilities
       that  need a built-in default keymap.  The XKB source files produced by
       4mxkbcomp24m are fully resolved and can be used to  verify  that	 the  files
       which typically make up an XKB keymap are merged correctly or to create
       a single file which contains a complete description of the keymap.

       The 4msource24m may specify an X display, or an 4m.xkb24m or 4m.xkm24m  file;   unless
       explicitly  specified,  the format of 4mdestination24m depends on the format
       of the source.	Compiling a 4m.xkb24m (keymap source) file generates a 4m.xkm0m
       (compiled keymap file) by default.   If the source is a 4m.xkm24m file or an
       X display, 4mxkbcomp24m generates a keymap source file by default.

       If the 4mdestination24m is an X display,	 the  keymap  for  the	display	 is
       updated with the compiled keymap.

       The  name  of  the 4mdestination24m is usually computed from the name of the
       source, with the extension replaced as appropriate.  When  compiling  a
       single  map from a file which contains several maps, 4mxkbcomp24m constructs
       the destination file name by appending an appropriate extension to  the
       name of the map to be used.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-a	 22mShow  all  keyboard	 information, reporting implicit or derived
	       information as a comment.  Only affects 4m.xkb24m format output.

       1m-C	 22mProduce a C header file as output (.h extension).

       1m-dflts	 22mCompute defaults for any missing components, such as key names.

       1m-I4m22mdir24m	 Specifies  top-level  directories  to	be  searched  for  files
	       included by the	keymap	description.   After  all  directories
	       specified  by  -I  options  have	 been  searched,  the  current
	       directory and  finally,	the  default  xkb  directory  (usually
	       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb) will be searched.

	       To  prevent  the	 current  and  default	directories from being
	       searched, use the -I option alone (i.e. without	a  directory),
	       before  any -I options that specify the directories you do want
	       searched.

       1m-l	 22mList maps that specify the 4mmap24m pattern in any files  listed  on
	       the command line (not implemented yet).

	       entries.

       1m-merge	 22mMerge the compiled information with the  map  from	the  server
	       (not implemented yet).

       1m-o 4m22mname24m Specifies a name for the generated output file.  The default is
	       the name of the source file with an appropriate	extension  for
	       the output format.

       1m-opt 4m22mparts0m
	       Specifies  a list of optional parts.  Compilation errors in any
	       optional parts  are  not	 fatal.	  Parts	 may  consist  of  any
	       combination  of	the  letters  4mc24m,  4mg24m,4mk24m,4ms24m,4mt24m  which  specify  the
	       compatibility  map,  geometry,  keycodes,  symbols  and	types,
	       respectively.

       1m-R4m22mdir24m	 Specifies the root directory for relative path names.

XKBCOMP(1)							    XKBCOMP(1)



1mNAME0m
       xkbevd - XKB event daemon

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxkbevd 22m[ options ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This  command  is very raw and is therefore only partially implemented;
       we present it here as a	rough  prototype  for  developers,  not	 as  a
       general	purpose	 tool for end users.  Something like this might make a
       suitable replacement for xev;  I'm not signing up, mind you,  but  it's
       an interesting idea.

       The  4mxkbevd24m	 event daemon listens for specified XKB events and executes
       requested commands if they occur.   The configuration file consists  of
       a list of event specification/action pairs and/or variable definitions.

       An event specification consists of a short XKB event name followed by a
       string or identifier which serves as a qualifier in parentheses;	 empty
       parenthesis indicate no qualification and serve to specify the  default
       command	which is applied to events which do not match any of the other
       specifications.	The interpretation of the  qualifier  depends  on  the
       type  of	 the  event:   Bell  events  match using the name of the bell,
       message events match on the contents of the message string and slow key
       events  accept  any  of	4mpress24m,  4mrelease24m, 4maccept24m, or 4mreject24m.	  No other
       events are currently recognized.

       An action consists of an	 optional  keyword  followed  by  an  optional
       string  argument.   Currently,  4mxkbev24m  recognizes  the  actions:  4mnone24m,
       4mignore24m, 4mecho24m, 4mprintEvent24m, 4msound24m, and	 4mshell24m.   If  the	action	is  not
       specified, the string is taken as the name of a sound file to be played
       unless it begins with an exclamation point, in which case it  is	 taken
       as a shell command.

       Variable	 definitions  in  the argument string are expanded with fields
       from the event in question before the argument string is passed to  the
       action  processor.   The general syntax for a variable is either $4mcP24m 4mor0m
       4m$(str),24m 4mwhere24m 4mc24m 4mis24m 4ma24m 4msingle24m 4mcharacter24m 4mand24m 4mstr24m 4mis24m 4ma24m 4mstring24m 4mof24m  4marbitrary0m
       4mlength.24m  4mAll24m 4mparameters24m 4mhave24m 4mboth24m 4msingle-character24m 4mand24m 4mlong24m 4mnames.0m

       The list of recognized parameters varies from event to event and is too
       long to list here right now.   This is a developer release  anyway,  so
       you  can	 be  expected  to  look	 at  the  source  code (evargs.c is of
       particular interest).

       The 4mignore24m, 4mecho24m, 4mprintEvent24m, 4msound24m,and 4mshell24m actions do what you would
       expect commands named 4mignore24m, 4mecho24m, 4mprintEvent24m, 4msound24m, and 4mshell24m to do,
       except that the sound command has only been implemented and tested  for
       SGI machines.   It launches an external program right now, so it should
       be pretty easy to adapt, especially if you like audio cues that	arrive
       about a half-second after you expect them.

       The   only   currently  recognized  variables  are  4msoundDirectory24m	and
       4msoundCmd24m.  I'm sure you can figure out what they do.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-help	 22mPrints a  usage  message  that  is	far  more  up-to-date  than
	       anything in this man page.

       1m-cfg 4m22mfile0m
	       Specifies the configuration file to read.   If no configuration
	       file  is	 specified,  4mxkbevd24m  looks	 for  ~/.xkb/xkbevd.cf	and
	       $(LIBDIR)/xkb/xkbevd.cf in that order.

       1m-sc 4m22mcmd24m Specifies the command used to play sounds.

       1m-sd 4m22mdirectory0m
	       Specifies a top-level directory for sound files.

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       Specifies  the  display	to  use.   If not present, 4mxkbevd24m uses
	       $DISPLAY.

XKBPRINT(1)							   XKBPRINT(1)



1mNAME0m
       xkbprint - print an XKB keyboard description

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxkbprint 22m[options] source [ output_file ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxkbprint24m comman generates a printable  or  encapsulated	 PostScript
       description  of	the XKB keyboard description specified by 4msource24m.	The
       4msource24m can be any compiled keymap (.xkm) file that includes a  geometry
       description  or	an  X  display	specification.	 If  an 4moutput_file24m is
       specified, xkbprint writes to it.  If  no  output  file	is  specified,
       xkbprint	 creates replaces the extension of the source file with 4m.ps24m or
       4m.eps24m depending on the requested format.  If the source is a non-local X
       display	(e.g.:0),  xkbprint  appends  the  appropriate	prefix	to the
       display specification, replacing the colon with a dash.	 For  a	 local
       display, xkprint uses server-4mn24m where 4mn24m is the number of the display.

XKILL(1)							      XKILL(1)



1mNAME0m
       xkill - kill a client by its X resource

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxkill	22m[-display  4mdisplayname24m] [-id 4mresource24m] [-button number] [-frame]
       [-all]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXkill24m is a utility for forcing the X server	 to  close  connections	 to
       clients.	  This	program	 is very dangerous, but is useful for aborting
       programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's screen.   If
       no  resource identifier is given with 4m-id24m, 4mxkill24m will display a special
       cursor as a prompt for the user to select a window to be killed.	 If  a
       pointer button is pressed over a non-root window, the server will close
       its connection to the client that created the window.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdisplayname0m
	       This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.

       1m-id 4m22mresource0m
	       This option specifies the X identifier for the  resource	 whose
	       creator	is  to be aborted.  If no resource is specified, 4mxkill0m
	       will display a special cursor with which you  should  select  a
	       window to be kill.

       1m-button 4m22mnumber0m
	       This  option specifies the number of pointer button that should
	       be used in selecting a window to kill.  If the  word  "any"  is
	       specified,  any button on the pointer may be used.  By default,
	       the first button in the	pointer	 map  (which  is  usually  the
	       leftmost button) is used.

       1m-all	 22mThis  option  indicates that all clients with top-level windows
	       on the screen should be killed.	4mXkill24m will ask you	 to  select
	       the  root  window with each of the currently defined buttons to
	       give you several chances to  abort.   Use  of  this  option  is
	       highly discouraged.

       1m-frame	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  xkill should ignore the standard
	       conventions for finding top-level  client  windows  (which  are
	       typically  nested  inside  a window manager window), and simply
	       believe that you want to kill direct children of the root.

1mCAVEATS0m
       This command does not provide any warranty that the  application	 whose
       connection  to  the X server is closed will abort nicely, or even abort
       at all. All this command does is to  close  the	connection  to	the  X
       server.	 Many	existing  applications	do  indeed  abort  when	 their
       connection to the X server is closed, but some can choose to  continue.

1mXDEFAULTS0m
       1mButton	 22mSpecifies a specific pointer button number or the word "any" to
	       use when selecting windows.

XLOAD(1)							      XLOAD(1)



1mNAME0m
       xload - system load average display for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxload 22m[-4mtoolkitoption24m	...]  [-scale  4minteger24m]  [-update	4mseconds24m] [-hl
       4mcolor24m] [-highlight 4mcolor24m]  [-remote 4mhost24m]
	     [-jumpscroll 4mpixels24m] [-label 4mstring24m] [-nolabel] [-lights]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxload24m program displays a periodically  updating	 histogram  of	the
       system load average.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXload24m  accepts  all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see
       4mX(7)24m).  The order of the options in unimportant.   4mxload24m  4malso24m  4maccepts0m
       4mthe24m 4mfollowing24m 4madditional24m 4moptions:0m


       1m-hl 4m22mcolor24m 1mor -highlight 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color of the scale lines.

       1m-jumpscroll 22mnumber of pixels
	       The  number  of	pixels to shift the graph to the left when the
	       graph reaches the right edge of the window.  The default	 value
	       is  1/2	the width of the current window.  Smooth scrolling can
	       be achieved by setting it to 1.

       1m-label 4m22mstring0m
	       The string to put into the label above the load average.

       1m-nolabel0m
	       If this command line option is specified then no label will  be
	       displayed above the load graph.

       1m-lights 22mWhen specified, this option causes 4mxload24m to display the current
	       load average by using the keyboard leds; for a load average  of
	       4mn24m,	xload  lights the first 4mn24m keyboard leds.  This option turns
	       off the usual screen display.

       1m-scale 4m22minteger0m
	       This option specifies the minimum number of tick marks  in  the
	       histogram,  where  one  division	 represents  one  load average
	       point.  If the load goes above this number, 4mxload24m  will  create
	       more  divisions,	 but it will never use fewer than this number.
	       The default is 1.


       1m-update 4m22mseconds0m
	       This option specifies the interval in seconds  at  which	 4mxload0m
	       updates	its  display.	The  minimum  amount  of  time allowed
	       between updates is 1 second.  The default is 10.

       1m-remote 4m22mhost0m
	       This option tells 4mxload24m to display the load of 4mhost24m instead  of
	       4mlocalhost24m.	4mXload24m  gets the information from the 4mrwhod24m database
	       and  consequently  requires  4mrwhod24m	to  be	executing  both	 on
	       4mlocalhost24m and 4mhost24m.

1mRESOURCES0m
       In  addition  to the resources available to each of the widgets used by
       4mxload24m there is one resource defined by the application itself.

       1mshowLabel (22mclass 1mBoolean)0m
	       If False then no label will be displayed.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know  the	 hierarchy  of
       the  widgets  which  compose 4mxload24m.	 In the notation below, indentation
       indicates hierarchical structure.   The	widget	class  name  is	 given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.

1mBUGS0m
       This program requires the ability to open and read the  special	system
       file  4m/dev/kmem24m.   Sites  that do not allow general access to this file
       should make 4mxload24m belong to the same group as 4m/dev/kmem24m and turn on the
       4mset24m 4mgroup24m 4mid24m permission flag.

       Reading	/dev/kmem  is inherently non-portable.	Therefore, the routine
       used to read it (get_load.c) must  be  ported  to  each	new  operating
       system.

	       aliased edges using the RENDER extension.

       1m-sharp	 22mIf	-render	 is  also  specified,  this  forces the edges to be
	       rendered in sharp mode, (ie. 1-bit alpha channel).

       1m-shape	 22mThis option indicates that the logo	 window	 should	 be  shaped
	       rather than rectangular.

1mRESOURCES0m
       The  default  width  and	 the default height are each 100 pixels.  This
       program uses the 4mLogo24m widget in the Athena widget set.  It	understands
       all of the Simple widget resource names and classes as well as:

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies  the  color  for the logo.  The default is depends on
	       whether	4mreverseVideo24m  is  specified.    If	  4mreverseVideo24m   is
	       specified  the  default	is  4mXtDefaultForeground24m, otherwise the
	       default is 4mXtDefaultBackground24m.

       1mshapeWindow (22mclass 1mShapeWindow)0m
	       Specifies that the window is shaped to the X logo.  The default
	       is False.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In  order  to  specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
       the widgets which compose 4mxlogo24m.  In the  notation	below,	indentation

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxlsatoms 22m[-options ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXlsatoms24m lists the interned atoms.	By default, all atoms starting from
       1 (the lowest atom value defined by  the	 protocol)  are	 listed	 until
       unknown	atom  is  found.  If an explicit range is given, 4mxlsatoms24m will
       try all atoms in the range,  regardless	of  whether  or	 not  any  are
       undefined.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdpy0m
	       This option specifies the X server to which to connect.

       1m-format 4m22mstring0m
	       This  option  specifies a 4mprintf24m-style string used to list each
	       atom 4m<value,name>24m pair, printed in	that  order  (4mvalue24m  is  an
	       4munsigned24m  4mlong24m	 and  4mname24m is a 4mchar24m 4m*24m).	 4mXlsatoms24m will supply a
	       newline at the end of each line.	 The default is 4m%ld\t%s24m.

       1m-range 4m22m[low]-[high]0m
	       This option specifies the range of atom values  to  check.   If
	       4mlow24m	 is not given, a value of 1 assumed.  If 4mhigh24m is not given,
	       4mxlsatoms24m will stop at the first undefined atom at or above 4mlow24m.

       1m-name 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the name of an atom to list.  If the atom
	       does not exist, a message  will	be  printed  on	 the  standard
	       error.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxlsfonts 22m[-options ...] [-fn pattern]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXlsfonts24m lists the fonts that match the given  4mpattern24m.   The	wildcard
       character  "*"  may  be	used  to  match	 any  sequence	of  characters
       (including none), and "?" to match any single character.	 If no pattern
       is given, "*" is assumed.

       The  "*"	 and  "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from being
       expanded by the shell.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mhost24m1m:4m22mdpy0m
	       This option specifies the X server to contact.

       1m-lll	 22mLists character metrics in addition to 1m-ll 22moutput.

       1m-m	 22mThis  option indicates that long listings should also print the
	       minimum and maximum bounds of each font.

       1m-C	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  listings  should  use   multiple
	       columns.	 This is the same as 1m-n 022m.

       1m-1	 22mThis option indicates that listings should use a single column.
	       This is the same as 1m-n 122m.

       1m-w 4m22mwidth0m
	       This option specifies the width in characters  that  should  be
	       used in figuring out how many columns to print.	The default is
	       79.

       1m-n 4m22mcolumns0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  number  of	 columns  to  use   in
	       displaying  the	output.	 By default, it will attempt to fit as
	       many columns  of	 font  names  into  the	 number	 of  character
	       specified by 1m-w 4m22mwidth24m.

       1m-u	 22mThis  option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.

       1m-o	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxlsfonts24m should do an 1mOpenFont  22m(and
	       1mQueryFont22m,	if  appropriate)  rather than a 1mListFonts22m.	 This is
	       useful if 1mListFonts 22mor 1mListFontsWithInfo 22mfail to list	a  known
	       font (as is the case with some scaled font systems).

       1m-fn 4m22mpattern0m

XMAG(1)								       XMAG(1)



1mNAME0m
       xmag - magnify parts of the screen

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxmag 22m[ 1m-mag 4m22mmagfactor24m ] [ 1m-source 4m22mgeom24m ] [ 4m-toolkitoption24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxmag24m program allows you to magnify portions of an X screen.  If no
       explicit region is specified, a square with the pointer	in  the	 upper
       left  corner is displayed indicating the area to be enlarged.  The area
       can be dragged out to the desired size by pressing Button  2.   Once  a
       region  has  been  selected,  a	window is popped up showing a blown up
       version of the region in which  each  pixel  in	the  source  image  is
       represented  by	a small square of the same color.  Pressing Button1 in
       the enlargement window shows the position and RGB value	of  the	 pixel
       under the pointer until the button is released.	Typing ``Q'' or ``^C''
       in the enlargement window exits the program.   The  application	has  5
       buttons	across	its  top.  4mClose24m deletes this particular magnification
       instance.  4mReplace24m brings up the rubber band selector again	 to  select
       another	region	for  this  magnification  instance.  4mNew24m brings up the
       rubber band selector to create a new magnification instance.  4mCut24m  puts
       the  magnification  image into the primary selection.  4mPaste24m copies the
       primary selection buffer into 4mxmag24m.	 Note that you can  cut	 and  paste
       between	4mxmag24m  and	the  4mbitmap24m  program.   Resizing  4mxmag24m  resizes the
       magnification area.  4mxmag24m preserves the colormap,  visual,	and  window
       depth of the source.

1mWIDGETS0m
       4mxmag24m uses the X Toolkit and the Athena Widget Set.	The magnified image
       is displayed in the Scale widget.  For more information, see the Athena
       Widget  Set  documentation.   Below is the widget structure of the 4mxmag0m
       application.   Indentation  indicates  hierarchical   structure.	   The
       widget class name is given first, followed by the widget instance name.

XMAN(1)								       XMAN(1)



1mNAME0m
       xman - Manual page display program for the X Window System

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxman 22m[ 4m-options24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXman24m is a manual page browser.  The default size of	 the  initial  4mxman0m
       window is small so that you can leave it running throughout your entire
       login session.  In the initial window there  are	 three	options:  4mHelp0m
       will pop up a window with on-line help, 4mQuit24m will exit, and 4mManual24m 4mPage0m
       will pop up a window with a manual page browser in it.  Typing Control-
       S will pop up a window prompting for a specific manual page to display.
       You may display more than one manual page browser window at a time from
       a single execution of 4mxman24m.

       For  further  information  on  using 4mxman24m, please read the on-line help
       information.  Most of this manual will discuss customization of 4mxman24m.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Xman supports all standard Toolkit command line arguments  (see	4mX24m(1)).
       The following additional arguments are supported.


       1m-helpfile 4m22mfilename0m
	      Specifies a helpfile to use other than the default.

       1m-bothshown0m
	      Allows  both  the	 manual page and manual directory to be on the
	      screen at the same time.

       1m-notopbox0m
	      Starts without the Top Menu with the three buttons in it.

       1m-geometry 4m22mWxH+X+Y0m
	      Sets the size and location  of  the  Top	Menu  with  the	 three
	      buttons in it.

       1m-pagesize 4m22mWxH+X+Y0m
	      Sets the size and location of all the Manual Pages.

1mCUSTOMIZING XMAN0m
       4mXman24m  allows  customization	 of both the directories to be searched for
       manual pages, and the name that each  directory	will  map  to  in  the
       4mSections24m  menu.   Xman  determines	which directories it will search by
       reading the 4mMANPATH24m environment variable.  If no 4mMANPATH24m is found  then
       the   directory	is  /usr/man  is  searched  on	POSIX  systems.	  This
       environment is expected to be a colon-separated list of directories for
       xman to search.

       setenv MANPATH /mit/kit/man:/usr/man

       By default, 4mxman24m will search each of the following directories (in each
       of the directories specified in the users MANPATH)  for	manual	pages.
       If  manual pages exist in that directory then they are added to list of
       manual pages for the corresponding menu item.   A  menu	item  is  only
       displayed for those sections that actually contain manual pages.

       Directory      Section Name
       ---------      ------------
       man1	      (1) User Commands
       man2	      (2) System Calls
       man3	      (3) Subroutines
       man4	      (4) Devices
       man5	      (5) File Formats
       man6	      (6) Games
       man7	      (7) Miscellaneous
       man8	      (8) Sys. Administration
       manl	      (l) Local
       mann	      (n) New
       mano	      (o) Old

       For  instance, a user has three directories in her manual path and each
       contain a directory called 4mman324m.  All these manual	pages  will  appear
       alphabetically  sorted  when  the user selects the menu item called 4m(3)0m
       4mSubroutines24m.  If there is no  directory  called  4mmano24m	in  any	 of  the
       directories  in her MANPATH, or there are no manual pages in any of the
       directories called 4mmano24m then no menu item will  be	displayed  for	the
       section called 4m(o)24m 4mOld24m.

1mBSD AND LINUX SYSTEMS0m
       In  some	 BSD  and  Linux  systems,  4mXman24m  will search for a file named
       4m/etc/man.conf24m which will contain the  list	of  directories	 containing
       manual  pages.  See  4mman.conf24m(5) for a complete description of the file
       format.

1mTHE MANDESC FILE0m
       By using the 4mmandesc24m file a user or system	manager	 is  able  to  more
       closely	control which manual pages will appear in each of the sections
       represented by menu items in the 4mSections24m menu.  This functionality	 is
       only  available	on  a  section by section basis, and individual manual
       pages may not be handled in this manner.	  (Although  generous  use  of
       symbolic	 links -- see 4mln24m(1) -- will allow almost any configuration you
       can imagine.)

       The format of the mandesc file is a character followed by a label.  The
       character  determines  which  of	 the sections will be added under this
       label.  For instance suppose that you would like	 to  create  an	 extra
       menu  item that contains all programmer subroutines.  This label should
       contain all manual pages in both sections two and three.	  The  4mmandesc0m
       file would look like this:

       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines

       This  will  add	a menu item to the 4mSections24m menu that would bring up a
       listing	of  all	 manual	 pages	in  sections  two  and	three  of  the
       Programmers  Manual.   Since  the label names are 4mexactly24m the same they
       will be added to the same section. Note,	 however,  that	 the  original
       sections still exist.

       If  you	want  to  completely  ignore  the default sections in a manual
       directory then add the line:

       no default sections

       anywhere in your mandesc file.  This  keeps  xman  from	searching  the
       default manual sections 4mIn24m 4mthat24m 4mdirectory24m 4monly24m.  As an example, suppose
       you want to do the same thing as above, but you don't think that it  is
       useful  to  have	 the  4mSystem24m 4mCalls24m or 4mSubroutines24m sections any longer.
       You would need to duplicate the default entries, as well as adding your
       new one.

       no default sections
       1(1) User Commands
       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines
       4(4) Devices
       5(5) File Formats
       6(6) Games
       7(7) Miscellaneous
       8(8) Sys. Administration
       l(l) Local
       n(n) New
       o(o) Old

       Xman  will  read	 any section that is of the from 4mman<character>24m, where
       <character> is  an  upper  or  lower  case  letter  (they  are  treated
       distinctly)  or	a  numeral (0-9).  Be warned, however, that man(1) and
       catman(8) will not search directories that are non-standard.

1mWIDGETS0m
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know  the	 hierarchy  of
       the  widgets  which  compose  4mxman24m.	 In the notation below, indentation
       indicates hierarchical structure.   The	widget	class  name  is	 given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.

1mGLOBAL ACTIONS0m
       4mXman24m  defines all user interaction through global actions.	This allows
       the user to modify the translation table of any widget,	and  bind  any
       event  to  the  new user action.	 The list of actions supported by 4mxman0m
       are:

       1mGotoPage(4m22mpage24m1m) 22mWhen used in a manual  page  display  window  this	 will
		      allow  the  user	to move between a directory and manual
		      page display.  The 4mpage24m argument can be either 1mDirectory0m
		      or 1mManualPage22m.

       1mQuit()		22mThis action may be used anywhere, and will exit xman.

       1mSearch(4m22mtype24m1m, 4m22maction24m1m)0m
		      Only  useful  when  used	in a search popup, this action
		      will cause the search widget to perform the named search
		      type  on	the string in the search popup's value widget.
		      This action will also pop down the  search  widget.  The
		      4mtype24m	 argument can be either 1mApropos22m, 1mManpage 22mor 1mCancel22m.
		      If an 4maction24m of 1mOpen 22mis specified then xman will open  a
		      new  manual  page	 to display the results of the search,
		      otherwise xman will attempt to display  the  results  in
		      the parent of the search popup.

       1mPopupHelp()	22mThis	 action	 may  be used anywhere, and will pop up the
		      help widget.

       1mPopupSearch()	22mThis action may  be	used  anywhere	except	in  a  help
		      window.  It will cause the search popup to become active
		      and visible on the screen, allowing the user search  for
		      a manual page.

       1mCreateNewManpage()0m
		      This  action may be used anywhere, and will create a new
		      manual page display window.

       1mRemoveThisManpage()0m
		      This action may be used  in  any	manual	page  or  help
		      display  window.	When called it will remove the window,
		      and clean up all resources associated with it.

       1mSaveFormattedPage(4m22maction24m1m)0m
		      This action can only be used  in	the  1mlikeToSave  22mpopup
		      widget,  and tells xman whether to 1mSave 22mor 1mCancel 22ma save
		      of the manual page that has just been formatted.

       1mShowVersion()	22mThis action may be called from any manual page  or  help
		      display window, and will cause the informational display
		      line to show the current version of xman.

XMESSAGE(1)							   XMESSAGE(1)



1mNAME0m
       xmessage - display a message or query in a window (X-based /bin/echo)

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxmessage 22m[ 1m-buttons 4m22mlabel124m[1m:4m22mvalue124m]1m,4m22mlabel224m[1m:4m22mvalue224m]1m, 22m...  ] [ 4moptions24m ]
       1m-file 4m22mfilename0m
       1mxmessage 22m[ 1m-buttons 4m22mlabel124m[1m:4m22mvalue124m]1m,4m22mlabel224m[1m:4m22mvalue224m]1m, 22m...  ] [ 4moptions24m ]
       4mmessage24m ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxmessage24m program displays a window containing a	 message  from	the
       command	line,  a file, or standard input.  Along the lower edge of the
       message is row of buttons; clicking the left mouse  button  on  any  of
       these buttons will cause 4mxmessage24m to exit.	Which button was pressed is
       returned in the exit status and, optionally, by writing	the  label  of
       the button to standard output.

       The  program  is typically used by shell scripts to display information
       to the user or to ask the user to make a choice.

       Unless a size is specified, 4mxmessage24m sizes itself to fit  the  message,
       up  to  a  maximum  size.   If  the  message is too big for the window,
       4mxmessage24m will display scroll bars.

1mOPTIONS0m
       These are the command line options that 4mxmessage24m understands.

       1m-buttons 4m22mbutton,button,...0m
	       This option will cause 4mxmessage24m to create one button  for  each
	       comma-separated 4mbutton24m argument.  The corresponding resource is
	       1mbuttons22m.  Each 4mbutton24m consists of a label  optionally	followed
	       by  a  colon  and  an exit value.  The label is the name of the
	       Command button widget created and  will	be  the	 default  text
	       displayed to the user.  Since this is the name of the widget it
	       may be used to change any of the resources associated with that
	       button.	 The  exit  value will be returned by 4mxmessage24m if that
	       button is selected.  The default exit value  is	100  plus  the
	       button  number.	 Buttons  are  numbered from the left starting
	       with one.  The default string if no 1m-buttons 22moption is given is
	       1mokay:022m.

       1m-default 4m22mlabel0m
	       Defines the button with a matching 4mlabel24m to be the default.	 If
	       not specified there is no default.  The corresponding  resource
	       is  1mdefaultButton22m.	 Pressing  Return  anywhere in the 4mxmessage0m
	       window will activate the default button.	  The  default	button
	       has a wider border than the others.

       1m-file 4m22mfilename0m
	       File  to	 display.   The	 corresponding	resource  is  1mfile22m.  A
	       4mfilename24m of `1m-22m' reads from standard input.  If this  option  is
	       not supplied, 4mxmessage24m will display all non-option arguments in
	       the style of 4mecho24m.	Either 1m-file 22mor a message	on  the	 command
	       line should be provided, but not both.

       1m-print	 22mThis  will	cause  the program to write the label of the button
	       pressed	to  standard  output.	Equivalent  to	 setting   the
	       1mprintValue  22mresource  to TRUE.  This is one way to get feedback
	       as to which button was pressed.

       1m-center 22mPop up the window at the center of the screen.   Equivalent	 to
	       setting the 1mcenter 22mresource to TRUE.

       1m-nearmouse0m
	       Pop up the window near the mouse cursor.	 Equivalent to setting
	       the 1mnearMouse 22mresource to TRUE.

       1m-timeout 4m22msecs0m
	       Exit with status 0 after 4msecs24m  seconds  if	the  user  has	not
	       clicked	on  a  button  yet.   The  corresponding  resource  is
	       1mtimeout22m.

1mWIDGET HIERARCHY0m
       Knowing the name and position in the hierarchy of each widget is useful
       when  specifying resources for them.  In the following chart, the class
       and name of each widget is given.

       Xmessage (xmessage)
	    Form form
		 Text message
		 Command (label1)
		 Command (label2)

1mRESOURCES0m
       The program has	a  few	top-level  application	resources  that	 allow
       customizations that are specific to 4mxmessage24m.

       1mfile	 22mA String specifying the file to display.

       1mbuttons 22mA  String  specifying the buttons to display.  See the 1m-buttons0m
	       command-line option.

       1mdefaultButton0m
	       A String specifying a default button by label.

       1mprintValue0m
	       A Boolean value specifying whether  the	label  of  the	button
	       pressed to exit the program is written to standard output.  The
	       default is FALSE.

       1mcenter	 22mA Boolean value specifying whether to pop up the window at	the
	       center of the screen.  The default is FALSE.

       1mnearMouse0m
	       A  Boolean  value  specifying whether to pop up the window near
	       the mouse cursor.  The default is FALSE.

       1mtimeout 22mThe number of seconds after which to exit with status  0.	The
	       default is 0, which means never time out.

       1mmaxHeight (22mclass 1mMaximum)0m
	       The  maximum  height  of the text part of the window in pixels,
	       used if no size was specified in the geometry.  The default  is
	       0, which means use 70% of the height of the screen.

       1mmaxWidth (22mclass 1mMaximum)0m
	       The  maximum  width  of	the text part of the window in pixels,
	       used if no size was specified in the geometry.  The default  is
	       0, which means use 70% of the width of the screen.

1mACTIONS0m
       1mexit(4m22mvalue24m1m)0m
	       exit  immediately  with	an  exit  status of 4mvalue24m (default 0).
	       This action can be used with translations to provide  alternate
	       ways of exiting 4mxmessage24m.

       1mdefault-exit()0m
	       exit  immediately with the exit status specified by the default
	       button.	If there is no default	button,	 this  action  has  no
	       effect.

1mEXIT STATUS0m
       If it detects an error, 4mxmessage24m returns 1, so this value should not be
       used with a button.

XMH(1)									XMH(1)



1mNAME0m
       xmh - send and read mail with an X interface to MH

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxmh 22m[-path 4mmailpath24m] [-initial 4mfoldername24m] [-flag] [-4mtoolkitoption24m ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxmh24m  program provides a graphical user interface to the 4mMH24m Message
       Handling System.	 To actually do things with your mail, it makes	 calls
       to  the	4mMH24m	 package.   Electronic mail messages may be composed, sent,
       received, replied to, forwarded, sorted, and stored  in	folders.   4mxmh0m
       provides extensive mechanism for customization of the user interface.

       This document introduces many aspects of the Athena Widget Set.


1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-path 4m22mdirectory0m
	       This  option  specifies an alternate collection of mail folders
	       in which to process mail.  The directory	 is  specified	as  an
	       absolute	 pathname.   The default mail path is the value of the
	       Path component in the 4mMH24m profile, which is determined by the 1mMH0m
	       environment   variable	and   defaults	to  $HOME/.mh_profile.
	       $HOME/Mail will be used as the path if the 4mMH24m Path is not given
	       in the profile.

       1m-initial 4m22mfolder0m
	       This option specifies an alternate folder which may receive new
	       mail and is initially  opened  by  4mxmh24m.   The  default  initial
	       folder is ``inbox''.

       1m-flag	 22mThis  option  will	cause  4mxmh24m	 to  change  the  appearance  of
	       appropriate folder buttons and to request the window manager to
	       change  the  appearance	of  the	 4mxmh24m  icon	 when  new mail has
	       arrived.	 By default, 4mxmh24m will change  the	appearance  of	the
	       ``inbox''   folder  button  when	 new  mail  is	waiting.   The
	       application-specific resource 1mcheckNewMail 22mcan be used to  turn
	       off this notification, and the 1m-flag 22moption will still override
	       it.

       These three options have corresponding application-specific  resources,
       1mMailPath22m, 1mInitialFolder22m, and 1mMailWaitingFlag22m, which can be specified in
       a resource file.

       The standard toolkit command line options are given in 4mX(7)24m.


1mINSTALLATION0m
       4mxmh24m requires that the user is already set up to use 4mMH24m, version 6.   To
       do  so,	see  if	 there	is  a  file  called  .mh_profile  in your home
       directory.  If it exists, check to see  if  it  contains	 a  line  that
       starts  with ``Current-Folder''.	 If it does, you've been using version
       4 or earlier of 4mMH24m; to convert to version 6, you must remove that line.
       (Failure	 to do so causes spurious output to stderr, which can hang 4mxmh0m
       depending on your setup.)

       If you do not already have a  .mh_profile,  you	can  create  one  (and
       everything  else	 you need) by typing ``inc'' to the shell.  You should
       do this before using 4mxmh24m to incorporate new mail.

       For more information, refer to the 4mmh(1)24m documentation.

       Much of the user interface of 4mxmh24m is configured in the 4mXmh24m  application
       class  defaults file; if this file was not installed properly a warning
       message will appear when 4mxmh24m is used.  4mxmh24m is backwards compatible with
       the R4 application class defaults file.

       The  default value of the SendBreakWidth resource has changed since R4.


1mBASIC SCREEN LAYOUT0m
       4mxmh24m starts out with a single window, divided into four major areas:


       1m-   22mSix buttons with pull-down command menus.


       1m-   22mA collection of buttons, one for each top level folder.	 New  users
	   of 4mMH24m will have two folders, ``drafts'' and ``inbox''.


       1m-   22mA  listing,  or	 Table	of  Contents,  of  the messages in the open
	   folder.  Initially, this will show the messages in ``inbox''.


       1m-   22mA view of one of your messages.	 Initially this is blank.


1mXMH AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET0m
       4mxmh24m uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set.   Many	 of
       the  features  described	 below	(scrollbars,  buttonboxes,  etc.)  are
       actually part of the Athena Widget Set, and are described here only for
       completeness.	For  more  information,	 see  the  Athena  Widget  Set
       documentation.


   1mSCROLLBARS0m
       Some parts of the main window will have a vertical  area	 on  the  left
       containing  a  grey  bar.   This	 area  is  a 4mscrollbar24m.  They are used
       whenever the data  in  a	 window	 takes	up  more  space	 than  can  be
       displayed.   The	 grey  bar  indicates  what  portion  of  your data is
       visible. Thus, if the entire length of the area is grey, then  you  are
       looking at all your data.  If only the first half is grey, then you are
       looking at the top half of your data.  The message  viewing  area  will
       have  a	horizontal  scrollbar if the text of the message is wider than
       the viewing area.

       You can use the pointer in the scrollbar to change  what	 part  of  the
       data  is	 visible.   If you click with pointer button 2, the top of the
       grey area will move to where the	 pointer  is,  and  the	 corresponding
       portion	of data will be displayed.  If you hold down pointer button 2,
       you can drag around the grey area.  This makes it easy to  get  to  the
       top  of	the  data:  just  press with button 2, drag off the top of the
       scrollbar, and release.

       If you click with button 1, then the data to the right of  the  pointer
       will scroll to the top of the window.  If you click with pointer button
       3, then the data at the top of the window will scroll down to where the
       pointer is.


   1mBUTTONBOXES, BUTTONS, AND MENUS0m
       Any  area  containing  many  words or short phrases, each enclosed in a
       rectangular or rounded boundary, is called a 4mbuttonbox24m.  Each rectangle
       or  rounded  area is actually a button that you can press by moving the
       pointer onto it and pressing pointer button 1.  If  a  given  buttonbox
       has  more  buttons  in  it  than	 can  fit, it will be displayed with a
       scrollbar, so you can always scroll to the button you want.

       Some buttons have pull-down menus.  Pressing the pointer	 button	 while
       the  pointer  is	 over  one  of	these  buttons	will pull down a menu.
       Continuing to hold the button down while moving the  pointer  over  the
       menu,  called dragging the pointer, will highlight each selectable item
       on the menu as the pointer passes over it.  To select an	 item  in  the
       menu, release the pointer button while the item is highlighted.


   1mADJUSTING THE RELATIVE SIZES OF AREAS0m
       If you're not satisfied with the sizes of the various areas of the main
       window, they can easily be changed.  Near the right edge of the	border
       between	each  region  is  a black box, called a 4mgrip24m.  Simply point to
       that grip with the pointer, press a pointer button, drag	 up  or	 down,
       and  release.  Exactly what happens depends on which pointer button you
       press.

       If you drag with the pointer button 2, then only that border will move.
       This mode is simplest to understand, but is the least useful.

       If  you	drag with pointer button 1, then you are adjusting the size of
       the window above.  4mxmh24m will attempt to  compensate	by  adjusting  some
       window below it.

       If  you	drag with pointer button 3, then you are adjusting the size of
       the window below.  4mxmh24m will attempt to  compensate	by  adjusting  some
       window above it.

       All  windows have a minimum and maximum size; you will never be allowed
       to move a border past the point where it would make a  window  have  an
       invalid size.


1mPROCESSING YOUR MAIL0m
       This  section  will define the concepts of the selected folder, current
       folder, selected message(s), current message,  selected	sequence,  and
       current sequence.  Each 4mxmh24m command is introduced.

       For  use	 in  customization,  action  procedures	 corresponding to each
       command are given; these action procedures can be used to customize the
       user   interface,   particularly	 the  keyboard	accelerators  and  the
       functionality of the buttons in the optional button box created by  the
       application resource 1mCommandButtonCount22m.


   1mFOLDERS AND SEQUENCES0m
       A  folder  contains  a  collection  of mail messages, or is empty.  4mxmh0m
       supports folders with one level of subfolders.

       The selected folder is whichever foldername appears in  the  bar	 above
       the  folder buttons.  Note that this is not necessarily the same folder
       that is currently being viewed.	To change the  selected	 folder,  just
       press  on  the  desired	folder	button	with pointer button 1; if that
       folder has subfolders, select a folder from the pull-down menu.

       The Table of Contents, or toc, lists the messages in the viewed folder.
       The  title  bar	above  the  Table of Contents displays the name of the
       viewed folder.

       The toc title bar also displays the name	 of  the  viewed  sequence  of
       messages	 within	 the  viewed  folder.	Every  folder  has an implicit
       ``all'' sequence, which contains all the messages in  the  folder,  and
       initially the toc title bar will show ``inbox:all''.


   1mFOLDER COMMANDS0m
       The 4mFolder24m command menu contains commands of a global nature:


       1mOpen Folder0m
	       Display	the  data  in the selected folder.  Thus, the selected
	       folder also becomes the viewed folder.	The  action  procedure
	       corresponding  to  this command is 1mXmhOpenFolder(22m[4mfoldername24m]1m)22m.
	       It takes an optional argument as the name of a folder to select
	       and  open;  if  no  folder is specified, the selected folder is
	       opened.	It may be specified as part of	an  event  translation
	       from  a	folder	menu  button  or  from	a folder menu, or as a
	       binding of a keyboard accelerator to any widget other than  the
	       folder menu buttons or the folder menus.

       1mOpen Folder in New Window0m
	       Displays	 the  selected	folder	in  an additional main window.
	       Note, however, that you cannot reliably display the same folder
	       in  more	 than  one  window  at	a  time, although 4mxmh24m will not
	       prevent	you  from  trying.   The   corresponding   action   is
	       1mXmhOpenFolderInNewWindow()22m.

       1mCreate Folder0m
	       Create  a  new folder.  You will be prompted for a name for the
	       new folder; to enter the name, move the pointer	to  the	 blank
	       box  provided  and  type.  Subfolders are created by specifying
	       the parent folder,  a  slash,  and  the	subfolder  name.   For
	       example,	 to create a folder named ``xmh'' which is a subfolder
	       of an existing folder named ``clients'', type  ``clients/xmh''.
	       Click  on  the  Okay button when finished, or just type Return;
	       click  on  Cancel  to  cancel  this  operation.	  The	action
	       corresponding to Create Folder is 1mXmhCreateFolder()22m.


       1mDelete Folder0m
	       Destroy the selected folder.  You will be asked to confirm this
	       action (see CONFIRMATION WINDOWS).  Destroying  a  folder  will
	       also  destroy any subfolders of that folder.  The corresponding
	       action is 1mXmhDeleteFolder()22m.


       1mClose Window0m
	       Exits 4mxmh24m, after first  confirming	that  you  won't  lose	any
	       changes; or, if selected from any additional 4mxmh24m window, simply
	       closes that window.  The corresponding action is 1mXmhClose()22m.


   1mHIGHLIGHTED MESSAGES, SELECTED MESSAGES0m
   1mAND THE CURRENT MESSAGE0m
       It is possible to highlight a set of adjacent messages in the  area  of
       the  Table  of  Contents.   To  highlight  a  message, click on it with
       pointer button 1.  To highlight a range of messages, click on the first
       one with pointer button 1 and on the last one with pointer button 3; or
       press pointer button 1, drag,  and  release.   To  extend  a  range  of
       selected	 messages, use pointer button 3.  To highlight all messages in
       the table of contents, click rapidly three times with pointer button 1.
       To  cancel any selection in the table of contents, click rapidly twice.

       The selected messages are the same as the highlighted messages, if any.
       If  no  messages	 are  highlighted,  then  the  selected	 messages  are
       considered the same as the current message.

       The current message is indicated by a `+' next to the  message  number.
       It  usually  corresponds	 to  the message currently being viewed.  Upon
       opening a  new  folder,	for  example,  the  current  message  will  be
       different from the viewed message.  When a message is viewed, the title
       bar above the view will identify the message.


   1mTABLE OF CONTENTS COMMANDS0m
       The 4mTable24m 4mof24m 4mContents24m command menu contains commands which  operate  on
       the open, or viewed, folder.


       1mIncorporate New Mail0m
			 Add  any  new mail received to viewed folder, and set
			 the current message to	 be  the  first	 new  message.
			 This  command	is  selectable	in  the	 menu and will
			 execute only if  the  viewed  folder  is  allowed  to
			 receive  new  mail.   By  default,  only ``inbox'' is
			 allowed to incorporate new mail.   The	 corresponding
			 action is 1mXmhIncorporateNewMail()22m.

       1mCommit Changes	   22mExecute  all  deletions,	moves, and copies that have
			 been marked in this folder.  The corresponding action
			 is 1mXmhCommitChanges()22m.

       1mPack Folder	   22mRenumber	the  messages  in this folder so they start
			 with 1 and increment by 1.  The corresponding	action
			 is 1mXmhPackFolder()22m.

       1mSort Folder	   22mSort  the	 messages  in  this folder in chronological
			 order.	 (As a side effect, this  may  also  pack  the
			 folder.)      The     corresponding	 action	    is
			 1mXmhSortFolder()22m.

       1mRescan Folder	   22mRebuild the list	of  messages.	This  can  be  used
			 whenever you suspect that 4mxmh24m's idea of what messages
			 you have is wrong.  (In particular, this is necessary
			 if  you  change  things  using	 straight  4mMH24m commands
			 without using	4mxmh24m.)   The  corresponding	 action	 is
			 1mXmhForceRescan()22m.


   1mMESSAGE COMMANDS0m
       The  4mMessage24m  command  menu	 contains  commands  which  operate  on the
       selected message(s), or if there are no selected messages, the  current
       message.


       1mCompose Message   22mComposes a new message.  A new window will be brought
			 up for composition; a description of it is  given  in
			 the  COMPOSITION WINDOWS section below.  This command
			 does	not   affect   the   current   message.	   The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhComposeMessage()22m.


       1mView Next Message 22mView  the first selected message.	 If no messages are
			 highlighted, view the current	message.   If  current
			 message  is  already  being  viewed,  view  the first
			 unmarked message  after  the  current	message.   The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhViewNextMessage()22m.


       1mView Previous	   22mView  the	 last selected message.	 If no messages are
			 highlighted, view the current	message.   If  current
			 message  is  already  being  viewed,  view  the first
			 unmarked message before  the  current	message.   The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhViewPrevious()22m.


       1mDelete		   22mMark  the	 selected  messages  for  deletion.   If no
			 messages are highlighted, mark	 the  current  message
			 for  deletion	and  automatically  display  the  next
			 unmarked  message.   The  corresponding   action   is
			 1mXmhMarkDelete()22m.


       1mMove		   22mMark  the	 selected  messages  to	 be  moved into the
			 currently selected folder.  (If the  selected	folder
			 is  the  same as the viewed folder, this command will
			 just beep.)  If no messages are highlighted, mark the
			 current  message  to  be  moved  and display the next
			 unmarked  message.   The  corresponding   action   is
			 1mXmhMarkMove()22m.


       1mCopy as Link	   22mMark  the	 selected  messages  to	 be copied into the
			 selected folder.  (If the selected folder is the same
			 as  the  viewed folder, this command will just beep.)
			 If no messages	 are  highlighted,  mark  the  current
			 message   to  be  copied.   Note  that	 messages  are
			 actually linked, not copied; editing a message copied
			 by  4mxmh24m  will  affect all copies of the message.	The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhMarkCopy()22m.


       1mUnmark		   22mRemove any of the above three marks from the selected
			 messages,   or	 the  current  message,	 if  none  are
			 highlighted.	  The	 corresponding	  action    is
			 1mXmhUnmark()22m.


       1mView in New	   22mCreate  a	 new  window  containing only a view of the
			 first selected message, or the	 current  message,  if
			 none  are  highlighted.   The corresponding action is
			 1mXmhViewInNewWindow()22m.


       1mReply		   22mCreate a composition window in  reply  to	 the  first
			 selected message, or the current message, if none are
			 highlighted.  The corresponding action is 1mXmhReply()22m.


       1mForward	   22mCreate a composition window whose body is initialized
			 to  contain  an  encapsulation	 of  of	 the  selected
			 messages,   or	  the  current	message	 if  none  are
			 highlighted.	  The	 corresponding	  action    is
			 1mXmhForward()22m.


       1mUse as Composition0m
			 Create a composition window whose body is initialized
			 to be the contents of the first selected message,  or
			 the  current  message	if  none  are  selected.   Any
			 changes you make in the composition will be saved  in
			 a  new message in the ``drafts'' folder, and will not
			 change the original message.  However,	 there	is  an
			 exception to this rule.  If the message to be used as
			 composition was selected from the ``drafts''  folder,
			 (see  BUGS),  the  changes  will  be reflected in the
			 original  message  (see  COMPOSITION  WINDOWS).   The
			 action	 procedure  corresponding  to  this command is
			 1mXmhUseAsComposition()22m.


       1mPrint		   22mPrint the selected messages, or the  current  message
			 if   none  are	 selected.   4mxmh24m  normally	 prints	 by
			 invoking the 4menscript24m(1) command,	 but  this  can	 be
			 customized with the 4mxmh24m application-specific resource
			 1mPrintCommand22m.    The    corresponding    action	 is
			 1mXmhPrint()22m.


   1mSEQUENCE COMMANDS0m
       The  4mSequence24m  command  menu  contains  commands  pertaining to message
       sequences (See MESSAGE-SEQUENCES), and a list of the  message-sequences
       defined for the currently viewed folder.	 The selected message-sequence
       is indicated by a check mark in its entry in the margin	of  the	 menu.
       To  change the selected message-sequence, select a new message-sequence
       from the sequence menu.


       1mPick Messages	   22mDefine a	new  message-sequence.	 The  corresponding
			 action is 1mXmhPickMessages()22m.

       The following menu entries will be sensitive only if the current folder
       has any message-sequences other than the ``all'' message-sequence.

       1mOpen Sequence	   22mChange the viewed sequence to  be	 the  same  as	the
			 selected   sequence.	The  corresponding  action  is
			 1mXmhOpenSequence()22m.


       1mAdd to Sequence   22mAdd the selected messages to the	selected  sequence.
			 The corresponding action is 1mXmhAddToSequence()22m.


       1mRemove from Sequence0m
			 Remove	  the  selected	 messages  from	 the  selected
			 sequence.     The     corresponding	 action	    is
			 1mXmhRemoveFromSequence()22m.


       1mDelete Sequence   22mRemove  the selected sequence entirely.  The messages
			 themselves are	 not  affected;	 they  simply  are  no
			 longer grouped together to define a message-sequence.
			 The corresponding action is 1mXmhDeleteSequence()22m.


   1mVIEW COMMANDS0m
       Commands in the 4mView24m menu and in the buttonboxes of view windows (which
       result  from  the  4mMessage24m	menu  command  1mView  In  New22m) correspond in
       functionality to commands of the same name in  the  4mMessage24m	 menu,	but
       they operate on the viewed message rather than the selected messages or
       current message.


       1mClose Window	   22mWhen the viewed message is in a separate view window,
			 this  command	will  close the view, after confirming
			 the status of any unsaved edits.   The	 corresponding
			 action procedure is 1mXmhCloseView()22m.

       1mReply		   22mCreate  a	 composition  window in reply to the viewed
			 message.    The   related   action    procedure    is
			 1mXmhViewReply()22m.

       1mForward	   22mCreate a composition window whose body is initialized
			 contain an encapsulation of the viewed message.   The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhViewForward()22m.

       1mUse As Composition0m
			 Create a composition window whose body is initialized
			 to be	the  contents  of  the	viewed	message.   Any
			 changes  made in the composition window will be saved
			 in a new message in the ``drafts'' folder,  and  will
			 not  change  the  original message.  An exception: if
			 the viewed message was selected from  the  ``drafts''
			 folder,  (see	BUGS)  the original message is edited.
			 The action procedure corresponding to this command is
			 1mXmhViewUseAsComposition()22m.

       1mEdit Message	   22mThis command enables the direct editing of the viewed
			 message.  The action procedure is 1mXmhEditView()22m.

       1mSave Message	   22mThis command is insensitive  until  the  message	has
			 been  edited;	when activated, edits will be saved to
			 the original message in the view.  The	 corresponding
			 action is 1mXmhSaveView()22m.

       1mPrint		   22mPrint the viewed message.	 4mxmh24m prints by invoking the
			 4menscript24m(1) command, but this can be customized  with
			 the  application-specific resource 1mPrintCommand22m.	The
			 corresponding action procedure is 1mXmhPrintView()22m.

       1mDelete		   22mMarks  the  viewed   message   for   deletion.	The
			 corresponding	      action	    procedure	    is
			 1mXmhViewMarkDelete()22m.


1mOPTIONS0m
       The 4mOptions24m menu contains one entry.


       1mRead in Reverse0m
	      When selected, a check mark appears in the margin of  this  menu
	      entry.   Read in Reverse will switch the meaning of the next and
	      previous messages, and will increment  to	 the  current  message
	      marker in the opposite direction.	 This is useful if you want to
	      read your messages in the	 order	of  most  recent  first.   The
	      option  acts  as a toggle; select it from the menu a second time
	      to undo the effect.  The check mark appears when the  option  is
	      selected.


1mCOMPOSITION WINDOWS0m
       Composition  windows  are created by selecting 1mCompose Message 22mfrom the
       4mMessage24m command menu, or by	 selecting  1mReply  22mor  1mForward  22mor  1mUse  as0m
       1mComposition  22mfrom  the 4mMessage24m or 4mView24m command menu.  These are used to
       compose mail messages.  Aside from the normal text  editing  functions,
       there are six command buttons associated with composition windows:

       1mClose Window	   22mClose  this composition window.  If changes have been
			 made since the most recent Save or Send, you will  be
			 asked	to  confirm  losing  them.   The corresponding
			 action is 1mXmhCloseView()22m.


       1mSend		   22mSend this composition.  The corresponding	 action	 is
			 1mXmhSend()22m.


       1mNew Headers	   22mReplace	the   current  composition  with  an  empty
			 message.  If changes have been made  since  the  most
			 recent	 Send  or  Save,  you will be asked to confirm
			 losing	  them.	   The	 corresponding	  action    is
			 1mXmhResetCompose()22m.


       1mCompose Message   22mBring   up   another  new	 composition  window.	The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhComposeMessage()22m.


       1mSave Message	   22mSave this composition in your  drafts  folder.   Then
			 you can safely close the composition.	At some future
			 date, you can continue working on the composition  by
			 opening the drafts folder, selecting the message, and
			 using	the  ``Use  as	Composition''  command.	   The
			 corresponding action is 1mXmhSave()22m.


       1mInsert		   22mInsert  a	 related  message into the composition.	 If
			 the composition window was created with  a  ``Reply''
			 command,  the	related	 message  is the message being
			 replied to, otherwise no related message  is  defined
			 and  this  button is insensitive.  The message may be
			 filtered before being inserted; see 1mReplyInsertFilter0m
			 under	APPLICATION  RESOURCES	for  more information.
			 The corresponding action is 1mXmhInsert()22m.


1mACCELERATORS0m
       Accelerators are shortcuts.  They allow you to invoke commands  without
       using the menus, either from the keyboard or by using the pointer.

       4mxmh24m defines pointer accelerators for common actions: To select and view
       a message with a single click, use pointer button 2  on	the  message's
       entry  in  the  table  of  contents.   To select and open a folder or a
       sequence in a single action, make the folder or sequence selection with
       pointer button 2.

       To  mark the highlighted messages, or current message if none have been
       highlighted, to be moved to a folder in a single	 action,  use  pointer
       button  3  to  select  the  target  folder  and simultaneously mark the
       messages.  Similarly, selecting a sequence with pointer button  3  will
       add the highlighted or current message(s) to that sequence.  In both of
       these operations, the selected folder or sequence and the viewed folder
       or sequence are not changed.

       4mxmh24m defines the following keyboard accelerators over the surface of the
       main window, except in the view area while editing a message:
	    Meta-I	   Incorporate New Mail
	    Meta-C	   Commit Changes
	    Meta-R	   Rescan Folder
	    Meta-P	   Pack Folder
	    Meta-S	   Sort Folder

	    Meta-space	   View Next Message
	    Meta-c	   Mark Copy
	    Meta-d	   Mark Deleted
	    Meta-f	   Forward the selected or current message
	    Meta-m	   Mark Move
	    Meta-n	   View Next Message
	    Meta-p	   View Previous Message
	    Meta-r	   Reply to the selected or current message
	    Meta-u	   Unmark

	    Ctrl-V	   Scroll the table of contents forward
	    Meta-V	   Scroll the table of contents backward
	    Ctrl-v	   Scroll the view forward
	    Meta-v	   Scroll the view backward


1mTEXT EDITING COMMANDS0m
       All of the text editing commands	 are  actually	defined	 by  the  Text
       widget  in  the	Athena	Widget	Set.   The  commands  may  be bound to
       different keys than the defaults described below through the X  Toolkit
       Intrinsics key re-binding mechanisms.  See the X Toolkit Intrinsics and
       the Athena Widget Set documentation for more details.

       Whenever you are asked to enter any text, you will be using a  standard
       text   editing	interface.    Various	control	  and  meta  keystroke
       combinations are bound to a somewhat Emacs-like set  of	commands.   In
       addition,  the  pointer buttons may be used to select a portion of text
       or to move the insertion point in the text.  Pressing pointer button  1
       causes  the  insertion  point  to move to the pointer.  Double-clicking
       button 1 selects a word, triple-clicking	 selects  a  line,  quadruple-
       clicking	 selects  a paragraph, and clicking rapidly five times selects
       everything.  Any selection may be extended in either direction by using
       pointer button 3.

       In  the	following, a 4mline24m refers to one displayed row of characters in
       the window.  A 4mparagraph24m refers to the text between	 carriage  returns.
       Text  within  a paragraph is broken into lines for display based on the
       current width of the window.  When a message is sent,  text  is	broken
       into  lines  based  upon the values of the 1mSendBreakWidth 22mand 1mSendWidth0m
       application-specific resources.

       The following keystroke combinations are defined:

       Ctrl-a	 Beginning Of Line   Meta-b	    Backward Word
       Ctrl-b	 Backward Character  Meta-f	    Forward Word
       Ctrl-d	 Delete Next Character		    Meta-iInsert File
       Ctrl-e	 End Of Line	     Meta-k	    Kill To End Of Paragraph
       Ctrl-f	 Forward Character   Meta-q	    Form Paragraph
       Ctrl-g	 Multiply Reset	     Meta-v	    Previous Page
       Ctrl-h	 Delete Previous Character	    Meta-yInsert Current Selection
       Ctrl-j	 Newline And Indent  Meta-z	    Scroll One Line Down
       Ctrl-k	 Kill To End Of Line Meta-d	    Delete Next Word
       Ctrl-l	 Redraw Display	     Meta-D	    Kill Word
       Ctrl-m	 Newline	     Meta-h	    Delete Previous Word
       Ctrl-n	 Next Line	     Meta-H	    Backward Kill Word
       Ctrl-o	 Newline And Backup  Meta-<	    Beginning Of File
       Ctrl-p	 Previous Line	     Meta->	    End Of File
       Ctrl-r	 Search/Replace Backward	    Meta-]Forward Paragraph

1mCONFIRMATION DIALOG BOXES0m
       Whenever you press a button that may cause you to lose some work or  is
       otherwise  dangerous,  a	 popup	dialog	box  will appear asking you to
       confirm the action.  This window will contain an	 ``Abort''  or	``No''
       button and a ``Confirm'' or ``Yes'' button.  Pressing the ``No'' button
       cancels the operation, and pressing the ``Yes'' will proceed  with  the
       operation.

       When  4mxmh24m  is  run under a Release 6 session manager it will prompt the
       user for confirmation during a checkpoint operation.   The  dialog  box
       asks whether any current changes should be committed (saved) during the
       checkpoint.  Responding ``Yes'' will have the same effect  as  pressing
       the  ``Commit  Changes''	 or ``Save Message'' buttons in the respective
       folder and view windows.	 Responding ``No'' will cause  the  checkpoint
       to  continue  successfully  to  completion  without actually saving any
       pending changes.	 If the session	 manager  disallows  user  interaction
       during  the checkpoint a ``Yes'' response is assumed; i.e.  all changes
       will be committed during the checkpoint.

       Some dialog boxes contain messages  from	 4mMH24m.   Occasionally  when	the
       message	is  more  than	one  line  long,  not  all of the text will be
       visible.	 Clicking on the message field will cause the  dialog  box  to
       resize so that you can read the entire message.


1mMESSAGE-SEQUENCES0m
       An  4mMH24m  message sequence is just a set of messages associated with some
       name.  They are local to a particular folder; two different folders can
       have  sequences	with  the  same	 name.	 The sequence named ``all'' is
       predefined in every folder; it consists of the set of all  messages  in
       that folder.  As many as nine sequences may be defined for each folder,
       including the predefined ``all'' sequence.  (The	 sequence  ``cur''  is
       also  usually defined for every folder; it consists of only the current
       message.	 4mxmh24m hides ``cur'' from the user, instead placing a  ``+''	 by
       the  current  message.	Also,  4mxmh24m	 does  not  support  4mMH24m's``unseen''
       sequence, so that one is also hidden from the user.)

       The message sequences for a folder  (including  one  for	 ``all'')  are
       displayed  in  the ``Sequence'' menu, below the sequence commands.  The
       table of contents (also known as	 the  ``toc'')	is  at	any  one  time
       displaying   one	  message  sequence.   This  is	 called	 the  ``viewed
       sequence'', and its name will be displayed in the toc title  bar	 after
       the  folder  name.   Also, at any time one of the sequences in the menu
       will have a check mark next to  it.   This  is  called  the  ``selected
       sequence''.   Note  that	 the viewed sequence and the selected sequence
       are not necessarily the same.  (This all pretty much corresponds to the
       way folders work.)

       The  1mOpen  Sequence22m,  1mAdd to Sequence22m, 1mRemove from Sequence22m, and 1mDelete0m
       1mSequence 22mcommands  are  active  only  if  the  viewed  folder  contains
       message-sequences other than ``all'' sequence.

       Note that none of the above actually affect whether a message is in the
       folder.	Remember that a sequence is  a	set  of	 messages  within  the
       folder; the above operations just affect what messages are in that set.

       To create a new sequence, select the ``Pick'' menu entry.  A new window
       will  appear,  with  lots  of  places to enter text. Basically, you can
       describe	 the   sequence's   initial   set   of	 messages   based   on
       characteristics	of the message.	 Thus, you can define a sequence to be
       all the messages	 that  were  from  a  particular  person,  or  with  a
       particular  subject,  and  so  on.  You can also connect things up with
       boolean operators, so you can select all things from ``weissman''  with
       a subject containing ``xmh''.

       The  layout  should  be	fairly	obvious.   The	simplest cases are the
       easiest: just point to the proper field and type.  If you enter in more
       than  one field, it will only select messages which match all non-empty
       fields.

       The more complicated cases arise when you want things  that  match  one
       field  or  another  one, but not necessarily both.  That's what all the
       ``or'' buttons are for.	If you want  all  things  with	subjects  that
       include	``xmh'' or ``xterm'', just press the ``or'' button next to the
       ``Subject:'' field.  Another  box  will	appear	where  you  can	 enter
       another subject.

       If  you	want  all  things  either  from	 ``weissman''  or with subject
       ``xmh'', but not necessarily both, select the  ``-Or-''	button.	  This
       will  essentially  double  the  size  of	 the form.  You can then enter
       ``weissman'' in a from: box on the top half, and ``xmh'' in a  subject:
       box on the lower part.

       If  you select the ``Skip'' button, then only those messages that 4mdon't0m
       match the fields on that row are included.

       Finally, in the bottom part of the  window  will	 appear	 several  more
       boxes.	One is the name of the sequence you're defining.  (It defaults
       to the name of the selected sequence when ``Pick'' was pressed,	or  to
       ``temp''	 if  ``all''  was the selected sequence.)  Another box defines
       which sequence to look through for potential members of this  sequence;
       it defaults to the viewed sequence when ``Pick'' was pressed.

       Two  more  boxes	 define	 a  date range; only messages within that date
       range will be considered.  These dates must be entered in RFC 822-style
       format:	each  date is of the form ``dd mmm yy hh:mm:ss zzz'', where dd
       is a one or two digit  day  of  the  month,  mmm	 is  the  three-letter
       abbreviation  for  a month, and yy is a year.  The remaining fields are
       optional: hh, mm, and ss specify a time of day, and zzz selects a  time
       zone.  Note that if the time is left out, it defaults to midnight; thus
       if you select a range of ``7 nov 86'' - ``8 nov 86'', you will only get
       messages	 from  the  7th,  as all messages on the 8th will have arrived
       after midnight.

       ``Date field'' specifies which field in the header to look at for  this
       date  range;  it defaults to ``Date''.  If the sequence you're defining
       already exists, you can optionally merge the  old  set  with  the  new;
       that's what the ``Yes'' and ``No'' buttons are all about.  Finally, you
       can ``OK'' the whole thing, or ``Cancel'' it.

       In general, most people will rarely use these features.	However,  it's
       nice  to	 occasionally use ``Pick'' to find some messages, look through
       them, and then hit ``Delete Sequence'' to  put  things  back  in	 their
       original state.


1mWIDGET HIERARCHY0m
       In  order  to  specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
       widgets	which  compose	4mxmh24m.   In	the  notation  below,	indentation
       indicates  hierarchical	structure.   The  widget  class	 name is given
       first, followed by the widget instance  name.   The  application	 class
       name is Xmh.

       The  hierarchy  of  the	main  toc  and	view  window  is identical for
       additional toc and view windows, except that a TopLevelShell widget  is
       inserted	 in  the hierarchy between the application shell and the Paned
       widget.

1mAPPLICATION-SPECIFIC RESOURCES0m
       The application class name is 1mXmh22m.	Application-specific resources	are
       listed below by name.  Application-specific resource class names always
       begin with an upper case character, but	unless	noted,	are  otherwise
       identical to the instance names given below.

       Any of these options may also be specified on the command line by using
       the X Toolkit Intrinsics resource specification	mechanism.   Thus,  to
       run 4mxmh24m showing all message headers,
       % xmh -xrm '*HideBoringHeaders:off'

       If  1mTocGeometry22m,  1mViewGeometry22m,  1mCompGeometry22m,  or 1mPickGeometry 22mare not
       specified, then	the  value  of	1mGeometry  22mis  used	 instead.   If	the
       resulting  height is not specified (e.g., "", "=500", "+0-0"), then the
       default height of windows is calculated from fonts and line counts.  If
       the  width  is  not specified (e.g., "", "=x300", "-0+0"), then half of
       the display width is used.  If unspecified, the height of a pick window
       defaults to half the height of the display.

       The following resources are defined:

       1mbanner	 22mA  short  string that is the default label of the folder, Table
	       of Contents, and view.  The default  shows  the	program	 name,
	       vendor, and release.


       1mblockEventsOnBusy0m
	       Whether to disallow user input and show a busy cursor while 4mxmh0m
	       is busy processing a command.  If false, the  user  can	`mouse
	       ahead'  and  type  ahead; if true, user input is discarded when
	       processing lengthy 4mmh24m commands.  The default is true.


       1mbusyCursor0m
	       The name of the symbol used to represent the  position  of  the
	       pointer,	 displayed  if	1mblockEventsOnBusy 22mis true, when 4mxmh24m is
	       processing a time-consuming command.  The default is "watch".


       1mbusyPointerColor0m
	       The  foreground	color  of  the	busy   cursor.	  Default   is
	       XtDefaultForeground.


       1mcheckFrequency0m
	       How  often  to check for new mail, make checkpoints, and rescan
	       the Table of Contents, in minutes.  If  1mcheckNewMail  22mis  true,
	       4mxmh24m	 checks	 to  see  if  you  have new mail each interval.	 If
	       1mmakeCheckpoints 22mis	true,  checkpoints  are	 made  every  fifth
	       interval.   Also every fifth interval, the Table of Contents is
	       checked for inconsistencies with the file system, and rescanned
	       if out of date.	To prevent all of these checks from occurring,
	       set 1mCheckFrequency 22mto 0.  The default is 1.	 This  resource	 is
	       retained	 for  backward compatibility with user resource files;
	       see also 1mcheckpointInterval22m, 1mmailInterval22m, and	 1mrescanInterval22m.


       1mcheckNewMail0m
	       If true, 4mxmh24m will check at regular intervals to see if new mail
	       has arrived for any of the top level  folders  and  any	opened
	       subfolders.   A	visual indication will be given if new mail is
	       waiting to be incorporated into a top level folder.  Default is
	       true.  The interval can be adjusted with 1mmailInterval22m.


       1mcheckpointInterval 22m(class 1mInterval22m)
	       Specifies  in minutes how often to make checkpoints of volatile
	       state, if 1mmakeCheckpoints 22mis true.	The default is 5 times	the
	       value of 1mcheckFrequency22m.


       1mcheckpointNameFormat0m
	       Specifies how checkpointed files are to be named.  The value of
	       this resource will be used to compose a file name by  inserting
	       the  message number as a string in place of the required single
	       occurrence of `%d'.  If the value of the resource is the	 empty
	       string,	or  if no `%d' occurs in the string, or if "%d" is the
	       value of the resource, the default will be used	instead.   The
	       default	is  "%d.CKP".	Checkpointing is done in the folder of
	       origin unless an absolute pathname  is  given.	4mxmh24m  does	not
	       assist  the user in recovering checkpoints, nor does it provide
	       for removal of the checkpoint files.


       1mcommandButtonCount0m
	       The number of command buttons to create	in  a  button  box  in
	       between	the  toc  and  the view areas of the main window.  4mxmh0m
	       will create these buttons with the names 4mbutton1,24m  4mbutton224m  and
	       so  on,	in a box with the name 4mcommandBox24m.	  The default is 0.
	       4mxmh24m users can specify labels and actions for the buttons  in  a
	       private	resource  file;	 see the section ACTIONS AND INTERFACE
	       CUSTOMIZATION.


       1mcompGeometry0m
	       Initial geometry for windows containing compositions.


       1mcursor	 22mThe name of the symbol used to represent the pointer.   Default
	       is ``left_ptr''.


       1mdebug	 22mWhether  or	 not  to  print	 information to stderr as 4mxmh24m runs.
	       Default is false.


       1mdraftsFolder0m
	       The folder used for message drafts.  Default is ``drafts''.


       1mgeometry0m
	       Default geometry to use.	 Default is none.


       1mhideBoringHeaders0m
	       If ``on'', then 4mxmh24m will attempt to skip  uninteresting  header
	       lines  within  messages	by  scrolling  them off the top of the
	       view.  Default is ``on''.


       1minitialFolder0m
	       Which folder to display on startup.  May also be set  with  the
	       command-line option 1m-initial22m.  Default is ``inbox''.


       1minitialIncFile0m
	       The  absolute  path  name  of your incoming mail drop file.  In
	       some installations, for example those  using  the  Post	Office
	       Protocol, no file is appropriate.  In this case, 1minitialIncFile0m
	       should not be specified, or  may	 be  specified	as  the	 empty
	       string,	and  4minc24m will be invoked without a -file argument.	 By
	       default, this resource has no value.  This resource is  ignored
	       if  4mxmh24m  finds  an	4m.xmhcheck24m file; see the section on multiple
	       mail drops.


       1mmailInterval (22mclass 1mInterval)0m
	       Specifies the interval in minutes at which the mail  should  be
	       checked,	 if  1mmailWaitingFlag	22mor  1mcheckNewMail  22mis  true.  The
	       default is the value of 1mcheckFrequency22m.


       1mmailPath0m
	       The full path prefix for locating your mail folders.  May  also
	       be set with the command line option, 1m-path22m.	 The default is the
	       Path component in the 4mMH24m profile, or ``$HOME/Mail'' if none.


       1mmailWaitingFlag0m
	       If true, 4mxmh24m will attempt to set an indication in its icon when
	       new  mail  is  waiting  to be retrieved.	 If 1mmailWaitingFlag 22mis
	       true, then 1mcheckNewMail 22mis assumed to be  true  as	well.	The
	       1m-flag	22mcommand  line  option  is  a	 quick	way to turn on this
	       resource.


       1mmakeCheckpoints0m
	       If true, 4mxmh24m will  attempt	to  save  checkpoints  of  volatile
	       edits.	The  default is false.	The frequency of checkpointing
	       is controlled by	 the  resource	1mcheckpointInterval22m.   For	the
	       location of checkpointing, see 1mcheckpointNameFormat22m.


       1mmhPath	 22mWhat  directory in which to find the 4mMH24m commands.  If a command
	       isn't found in the user's path, then the path specified here is
	       used.  Default is ``/usr/local/mh6''.


       1mnewMailBitmap 22m(class 1mNewMailBitmap22m)
	       The  bitmap  to show in the folder button when a folder has new
	       mail.  The default is ``black6''.


       1mnewMailIconBitmap 22m(class 1mNewMailBitmap22m)
	       The bitmap suggested to the window manager for  the  icon  when
	       any folder has new mail.	 The default is ``flagup''.


       1mnoMailBitmap (22mclass 1mNoMailBitmap)0m
	       The  bitmap  to	show in the folder button when a folder has no
	       new mail.  The default is ``box6''.


       1mnoMailIconBitmap (22mclass 1mNoMailBitmap)0m
	       The bitmap suggested to the window manager for the icon when no
	       folders have new mail.  The default is ``flagdown''.


       1mpickGeometry0m
	       Initial geometry for pick windows.


       1mpointerColor0m
	       The    foreground   color   of	the   pointer.	  Default   is
	       XtDefaultForeground.


       1mprefixWmAndIconName0m
	       Whether to prefix the  window  and  icon	 name  with  "xmh:  ".
	       Default is true.


       1mprintCommand0m
	       An  4msh24m command to execute to print a message.  Note that stdout
	       and stderr must be specifically redirected.  If	a  message  or
	       range of messages is selected for printing, the full file paths
	       of each message	file  are  appended  to	 the  specified	 print
	       command.	 The default is ``enscript >/dev/null 2>/dev/null''.


       1mreplyInsertFilter0m
	       An  4msh24m  command  to	 be  executed  when  the  4mInsert24m  button is
	       activated in a composition window.  The full path and  filename
	       of  the	source message is appended to the command before being
	       passed to 4msh24m(1).  The default filter is 4mcat24m;  i.e.  it	 inserts
	       the  entire  message into the composition.  Interesting filters
	       are: 4msed24m 4m's/^/>24m 4m/'24m or  4mawk24m  4m-e24m	4m'{print24m  4m"24m	 4m"24m	 4m$0}'24m  or	4m<mh0m
	       4mdirectory>/lib/mhl24m 4m-form24m 4mmhl.body24m.


       1mrescanInterval 22m(class 1mInterval22m)
	       How  often  to  check the Table of Contents of currently viewed
	       folders and of folders with messages  currently	being  viewed,
	       and to update the Table of Contents if 4mxmh24m sees inconsistencies
	       with the file system in these folders.  The default is 5	 times
	       the value of 1mcheckFrequency22m.


       1mreverseReadOrder0m
	       When  true,  the	 next message will be the message prior to the
	       current message in the table  of	 contents,  and	 the  previous
	       message	will  be  the message after the current message in the
	       table of contents.  The default is false.


       1msendBreakWidth0m
	       When a message is sent from 4mxmh24m, lines longer than	this  value
	       will  be	 split into multiple lines, each of which is no longer
	       than 1mSendWidth22m.  This value may  be	 overridden  for  a  single
	       message	by  inserting an additional line in the message header
	       of the form 4mSendBreakWidth:24m 4mvalue24m.  This line will  be	 removed
	       from  the  header  before  the message is sent.	The default is
	       2000 (to allow for sending mail containing source patches).


       1msendWidth0m
	       When  a	message	 is  sent  from	  4mxmh24m,   lines   longer   than
	       1mSendBreakWidth	 22mcharacters	will  be split into multiple lines,
	       each of which is no longer than this value.  This value may  be
	       overridden for a single message by inserting an additional line
	       in the message header of the form 4mSendWidth:24m 4mvalue24m.  This  line
	       will  be	 removed  from	the header before the message is sent.
	       The default is 72.


       1mshowOnInc0m
	       Whether	to  automatically  show	 the  current  message	 after
	       incorporating new mail.	Default is true.


       1mskipCopied0m
	       Whether	to  skip  over	messages marked for copying when using
	       ``View Next Message'' and ``View Previous  Message''.   Default
	       is true.


       1mskipDeleted0m
	       Whether	to  skip  over messages marked for deletion when using
	       ``View Next Message'' and ``View Previous  Message''.   Default
	       is true.


       1mskipMoved0m
	       Whether	to  skip  over	messages  marked  for  moving to other
	       folders when using ``View Next Message''	 and  ``View  Previous
	       Message''.  Default is true.


       1mstickyMenu0m
	       If  true,  when popup command menus are used, the most recently
	       selected entry will be under the cursor when the menu pops  up.
	       Default	is  false.  See the file 4mclients/xmh/Xmh.sample24m for an
	       example of how to specify resources for popup command menus.


       1mtempDir 22mDirectory for 4mxmh24m to store temporary  files.	For  privacy,  a
	       user might want to change this to a private directory.  Default
	       is ``/tmp''.


       1mtocGeometry0m
	       Initial geometry for main 4mxmh24m toc and view windows.


       1mtocPercentage0m
	       The percentage of the main window that is used to  display  the
	       Table of Contents.  Default is 33.


       1mtocWidth0m
	       How  many characters to generate for each message in a folder's
	       table of contents.  Default is 100.  Use less if	 the  geometry
	       of  the main 4mxmh24m window results in the listing being clipped at
	       the right hand boundary, or if you  plan	 to  use  4mmhl24m  a  lot,
	       because	it will be faster, and the extra characters may not be
	       useful.


       1mviewGeometry0m
	       Initial geometry for windows showing a view of a message.


1mMULTIPLE MAIL DROPS0m
       Users may need to incorporate mail from multiple spool  files  or  mail
       drops.	If incoming mail is forwarded to the 4mMH24m 4mslocal24m program, it can
       be sorted as specified by the user into multiple incoming  mail	drops.
       Refer  to the 4mMH24m man page for 4mslocal24m to learn how to specify forwarding
       and the automatic sorting of incoming mail in a 4m.maildelivery24m file.

       To inform 4mxmh24m about the various mail drops, create a file in your  home
       directory  called  4m.xmhcheck24m.  In this file, a mapping between existing
       folder names and mail drops is created by giving a folder name followed
       by  the	absolute pathname of the mail drop site, with some white space
       separating them, one mapping per line.  4mxmh24m will read this file whether
       or not resources are set for notification of new mail arrival, and will
       allow incorporation of new mail into any folder with a mail drop.   4mxmh0m
       will  invoke 4minc24m with the 4m-file24m argument, and if 4mxmh24m has been requested
       to check for new mail, it will check directly, instead of using 4mmsgchk24m.

       An  example  of	4m.xmhcheck24m	file  format, for the folders ``inbox'' and
       ``xpert'':
       inbox	 /usr/spool/mail/converse
       xpert	 /users/converse/maildrops/xpert


1mACTIONS AND INTERFACE CUSTOMIZATION0m
       Because 4mxmh24m provides action	 procedures  which  correspond	to  command
       functionality   and   installs	accelerators,	users	can  customize
       accelerators and new button functionality in a private  resource	 file.
       For   examples	of  specifying	customized  resources,	see  the  file
       4mmit/clients/xmh/Xmh.sample24m.	 To understand the syntax, see the Appendix
       of  the 4mX24m 4mToolkit24m 4mIntrinsics24m specification on 4mTranslation24m 4mTable24m 4mSyntax24m,
       and any general	explanation  of	 using	and  specifying	 4mX24m	 resources.
       Unpredictable  results  can  occur  if  actions	are bound to events or
       widgets for which they were not designed.

       Here's an example of how to bind actions to your own 4mxmh24m  buttons,	and
       how  to	redefine  the default accelerators so that the Meta key is not
       required, in case you don't have access to the  sample  file  mentioned
       above.

       ! To create buttons in the middle of the main window and give them semantics:

       Xmh*CommandButtonCount:	     5

       Xmh*commandBox.button1.label: Inc
       Xmh*commandBox.button1.translations: #override\
	    <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: XmhIncorporateNewMail() unset()

       Xmh*commandBox.button2.label: Compose
       Xmh*commandBox.button2.translations: #override\
	    <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: XmhComposeMessage() unset()

       Xmh*commandBox.button3.label: Next
       Xmh*commandBox.button3.translations: #override\
	    <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: XmhViewNextMessage() unset()

       Xmh*commandBox.button4.label: Delete
       Xmh*commandBox.button4.translations: #override\
	    <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: XmhMarkDelete() unset()

       Xmh*commandBox.button5.label: Commit
       Xmh*commandBox.button5.translations: #override\
	    <Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>: XmhCommitChanges() unset()

       ! To redefine the accelerator bindings to exclude modifier keys,
       ! and add your own keyboard accelerator for Compose Message:

       Xmh*tocMenu.accelerators: #override\n\
	    !:<Key>I: XmhIncorporateNewMail()\n\
	    !:<Key>C:	   XmhCommitChanges()\n\
	    !:<Key>R: XmhForceRescan()\n\
	    !:<Key>P: XmhPackFolder()\n\
	    !:<Key>S: XmhSortFolder()\n
       Xmh*messageMenu.accelerators: #override\n\
	    !:<Key>E: XmhComposeMessage()\n\
	    !<Key>space:    XmhViewNextMessage()\n\
	    !:<Key>c: XmhMarkCopy()\n\
	    !:<Key>d: XmhMarkDelete()\n\
	    !:<Key>f: XmhForward()\n\
	    !:<Key>m: XmhMarkMove()\n\
	    !:<Key>n: XmhViewNextMessage()\n\
	    !:<Key>p: XmhViewPreviousMessage()\n\
	    !:<Key>r: XmhReply()\n\
	    !:<Key>u: XmhUnmark()\n

       4mxmh24m	 provides  action  procedures  which  correspond  to entries in the
       command	menus;	these  are  given  in  the  sections  describing  menu
       commands,  not  here.   In  addition  to	 the  actions corresponding to
       commands in the menus, these action routines are defined:

       1mXmhPushFolder(22m[4mfoldername,24m 4m...24m]1m)0m
		 This action pushes each of its argument(s) onto  a  stack  of
		 foldernames.	If no arguments are given, the selected folder
		 is pushed onto the stack.

       1mXmhPopFolder()0m
		 This action pops one foldername from the stack and  sets  the
		 selected folder.

       1mXmhPopupFolderMenu()0m
		 This  action  should  always be taken when the user selects a
		 folder button.	 A folder button represents a folder and  zero
		 or more subfolders.  The menu of subfolders is built upon the
		 first	reference,  by	this  routine.	 If   there   are   no
		 subfolders,  this  routine  will mark the folder as having no
		 subfolders, and no menu will be built.	 In that case the menu
		 button	 emulates a toggle button.  When subfolders exist, the
		 menu will popup, using the menu button action PopupMenu().

       1mXmhSetCurrentFolder()0m
		 This action allows menu buttons to emulate toggle buttons  in
		 the  function of selecting a folder.  This action is for menu
		 button widgets only, and sets the selected folder.

       1mXmhLeaveFolderButton()0m
		 This action ensures that the  menu  button  behaves  properly
		 when  the  user  moves	 the  pointer  out  of the menu button
		 window.

       1mXmhPushSequence(22m[4msequencename,24m 4m...24m]1m)0m
		 This action pushes each of its arguments onto	the  stack  of
		 sequence  names.   If	no  arguments  are given, the selected
		 sequence is pushed onto the stack.

       1mXmhPopSequence()0m
		 This action pops one sequence name from the stack of sequence
		 names, which then becomes the selected sequence.

       1mXmhPromptOkayAction()0m
		 This  action is equivalent to pressing the okay button in the
		 Create Folder popup.

       1mXmhReloadSeqLists()0m
		 This action rescans the contents of the public	 4mMH24m  sequences
		 for the currently opened folder and updates the sequence menu
		 if necessary.

       1mXmhShellCommand( 4m22mparameter24m [4m,24m 4mparameter24m]1m)0m
		 At least one parameter must  be  specified.   The  parameters
		 will be concatenated with a space character separator, into a
		 single string, and the list of selected messages,  or	if  no
		 messages  are selected, the current message, will be appended
		 to the string of parameters.  The string will be executed  as
		 a  shell  command.  The messages are always given as absolute
		 pathnames.  It is an error to cause this  action  to  execute
		 when there are no selected messages and no current message.

       1mXmhCheckForNewMail()0m
		 This  action  will  check all mail drops known to xmh.	 If no
		 mail drops have been specified by the user either through the
		 4m.xmhcheck24m	 file  or  by  the  1minitialIncFile 22mresource, the 4mMH0m
		 command 4mmsgchk24m is used to check for new mail, otherwise,	4mxmh0m
		 checks directly.

       1mXmhWMProtocols(22m[1mwm_delete_window22m] [1mwm_save_yourself22m])
		 This  action  is  responsible	for  participation  in	window
		 manager  communication	 protocols.   It  responds  to	delete
		 window and save yourself messages.  The user can cause 4mxmh24m to
		 respond to one or both of these protocols, exactly as if  the
		 window	 manager  had made the request, by invoking the action
		 with the appropriate parameters.  The action  is  insensitive
		 to  the case of the string parameters.	 If the event received
		 is a ClientMessage event and parameters are present, at least
		 one  of  the  parameters  must	 correspond  to	 the  protocol
		 requested by the event for the request to be honored by  4mxmh24m.


1mCUSTOMIZATION USING 4m22mMH0m
       The  initial  text  displayed  in  a composition window is generated by
       executing the corresponding 4mMH24m command; i.e. 4mcomp24m, 4mrepl24m, or  4mforw24m,  and
       therefore  message  components may be customized as specified for those
       commands.  4mcomp24m is executed only once per invocation  of  4mxmh24m	and  the
       message template is re-used for every successive new composition.

       4mxmh24m	 uses  4mMH24m	commands, including 4minc24m, 4mmsgchk24m, 4mcomp24m, 4msend24m, 4mrepl24m, 4mforw24m,
       4mrefile24m, 4mrmm24m, 4mpick24m, 4mpack24m, 4msort24m, and 4mscan24m.  Some flags for these commands
       can  be	specified  in  the  4mMH24m  profile;  4mxmh24m	 may override them.  The
       application resource 1mdebug 22mcan be set to true to see how  4mxmh24m	uses  4mMH0m
       commands.


1mENVIRONMENT0m
       HOME - users's home directory
       MH - to get the location of the 4mMH24m profile file

1mFILES0m
       ~/.mh_profile  - 4mMH24m profile, used if the MH environment variable is not
       set
       ~/Mail - directory of folders, used if the 4mMH24m profile cannot be found
       ~/.xmhcheck - optional, for multiple mail  drops	 in  cooperation  with
       4mslocal24m.
       /usr/local/mh6 - 4mMH24m commands, as a last resort, see 1mmhPath22m.
       ~/Mail/<folder>/.xmhcache - 4mscan24m output in each folder
       ~/Mail/<folder>/.mh_sequences - sequence definitions, in each folder
       /tmp - temporary files, see 1mtempDir22m.

       X(7),   xrdb(1),	 X  Toolkit  Intrinsics,  Athena  Widget  Set,	mh(1),
       enscript(1)
       At least one book has been published about 4mMH24m and 4mxmh24m.

1mBUGS0m
       - When the user closes a window, all windows which  are	transient  for
       that window should also be closed by 4mxmh24m.
       -  When	1mXmhUseAsComposition  22mand  1mXmhViewUseAsComposition  22moperate  on
       messages in the 1mDraftsFolder22m, 4mxmh24m disallows editing of the  composition
       if the same message is also being viewed in another window.
       -  Occasionally	after  committing  changes, the table of contents will
       appear to be completely blank when there are actually messages present.
       When  this  happens, refreshing the display, or typing Control-L in the
       table of contents, will often cause the correct listing to appear.   If
       this doesn't work, force a rescan of the folder.
       - Should recognize and use the ``unseen'' message-sequence.
       -  Should  determine  by	 itself if the user hasn't used 4mMH24m before, and
       offer to create the .mh_profile, instead of hanging on inc.
       - A few commands are missing (rename folder, resend message).
       - WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol doesn't work right when requesting deletion
       of  the	first  toc  and	 view,	while trying to keep other 4mxmh24m windows
       around.
       - Doesn't support annotations when replying to messages.
       - Doesn't allow folders to be shared without write permission.
       - Doesn't recognize private sequences.
       - 4mMH24m will report that the 4m.mh_sequences24m file is poorly formatted if any
       sequence	 definition  in	 a particular folder contains more than 4mBUFSIZ0m
       characters.  4mxmh24m tries to capture these messages and display them  when
       they occur, but it cannot correct the problem.
       - Should save a temporary checkpoint file rather than requiring changes
       to be committed in the non-shutdown case.

1mNAME0m
       xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxmkmf 22m[ -a ] [ 4mtopdir24m [ 4mcurdir24m ] ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxmkmf24m command is the normal  way  to  create  a	 4mMakefile24m	from  an
       4mImakefile24m shipped with third-party software.

       When  invoked with no arguments in a directory containing an 4mImakefile,0m
       the 4mimake24m program is run with arguments  appropriate  for  your  system
       (configured into 4mxmkmf24m when X was built) and generates a 4mMakefile.0m

       When  invoked  with  the	 4m-a24m  option,  4mxmkmf24m builds the 4mMakefile24m in the
       current directory, and then automatically executes  ``make  Makefiles''
       (in  case  there	 are  subdirectories),	``make	includes'', and ``make
       depend'' for you.  This is the normal way to configure software that is
       outside the X Consortium build tree.

       If  working inside the X Consortium build tree (unlikely unless you are
       an X developer, and even then this option is never  really  used),  the
       4mtopdir24m  argument  should be specified as the relative pathname from the
       current directory to the top of the build tree.	Optionally, 4mcurdir24m may
       be  specified  as a relative pathname from the top of the build tree to
       the current directory.  It is necessary to supply 4mcurdir24m if the current
       directory has subdirectories, or the 4mMakefile24m will not be able to build
       the subdirectories.  If a 4mtopdir24m is given,	4mxmkmf24m  assumes  nothing  is
       installed  on your system and looks for files in the build tree instead
       of using the installed versions.

XMODMAP(1)							    XMODMAP(1)



1mNAME0m
       xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings  in
       X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxmodmap 22m[-options ...] [filename]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxmodmap24m  program is used to edit and display the keyboard 4mmodifier0m
       4mmap24m and 4mkeymap24m 4mtable24m that are used by client  applications  to  convert
       event keycodes into keysyms.  It is usually run from the user's session
       startup script to configure the keyboard according to personal  tastes.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options may be used with 4mxmodmap24m:

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the host and display to use.

       1m-help	 22mThis  option  indicates that a brief description of the command
	       line arguments should be printed on the standard error channel.
	       This  will  be  done whenever an unhandled argument is given to
	       4mxmodmap.0m

       1m-grammar0m
	       This option  indicates  that  a	help  message  describing  the
	       expression grammar used in files and with -e expressions should
	       be printed on the standard error.

       1m-verbose0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  4mxmodmap24m  should  print   logging
	       information as it parses its input.

       1m-quiet	 22mThis  option  turns	 off  the  verbose  logging.   This  is the
	       default.

       1m-n	 22mThis option	 indicates  that  4mxmodmap24m	should	not  change  the
	       mappings,  but  should  display	what it would do, like 4mmake(1)0m
	       does when given this option.

       1m-e 4m22mexpression0m
	       This option specifies an expression to be executed.  Any number
	       of expressions may be specified from the command line.

       1m-pm	 22mThis  option  indicates that the current modifier map should be
	       printed on the standard output.

       1m-pk	 22mThis option indicates that the current keymap table	 should	 be
	       printed on the standard output.

       1m-pke	 22mThis  option  indicates that the current keymap table should be
	       printed on the standard output in the form of expressions  that
	       can be fed back to 4mxmodmap24m.

       1m-pp	 22mThis  option  indicates  that the current pointer map should be
	       printed on the standard output.

       1m-	 22mA lone dash means that the standard input should be used as the
	       input file.

       The  4mfilename24m  specifies  a	 file  containing 4mxmodmap24m expressions to be
       executed.  This file is usually kept in the user's home directory  with
       a name like 4m.xmodmaprc24m.

1mEXPRESSION GRAMMAR0m
       The  4mxmodmap24m  program  reads  a list of expressions and parses them all
       before attempting to execute any of them.  This makes  it  possible  to
       refer  to  keysyms  that	 are  being redefined in a natural way without
       having to worry as much about name conflicts.

       1mkeycode 4m22mNUMBER24m 1m= 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 4m...0m
	       The list of keysyms is assigned to the indicated keycode (which
	       may be specified in decimal, hex or octal and can be determined
	       by running the 4mxev24m	program).   Up	to  eight  keysyms  may	 be
	       attached	 to  a	key, however the last four are not used in any
	       major X server implementation.  The first keysym is  used  when
	       no  modifier  key  is pressed in conjunction with this key, the
	       second with Shift, the third when the Mode_switch key  is  used
	       with  this  key	and  the  fourth when both the Mode_switch and
	       Shift keys are used.

       1mkeycode any = 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 4m...0m
	       If no existing key has the specified list of  keysyms  assigned
	       to  it, a spare key on the keyboard is selected and the keysyms
	       are assigned to it.  The list of keysyms may  be	 specified  in
	       decimal, hex or octal.

       1mkeysym 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 1m= 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 4m...0m
	       The  4mKEYSYMNAME24m  on	 the  left  hand  side	is  translated into
	       matching keycodes used to  perform  the	corresponding  set  of
	       1mkeycode  22mexpressions.  The list of keysym names may be found in
	       the header file 4m<X11/keysymdef.h>24m (without the 4mXK_24m  prefix)  or
	       the keysym database 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB24m.  Note that if
	       the same keysym is bound to multiple keys,  the	expression  is
	       executed for each matching keycode.

       1mclear 4m22mMODIFIERNAME0m
	       This  removes  all  entries  in	the modifier map for the given
	       modifier, where valid name are:	1mShift22m,  1mLock22m,	 1mControl22m,	1mMod122m,
	       1mMod222m,  1mMod322m,  1mMod422m,  and 1mMod5 22m(case does not matter in modifier
	       names, although it does	matter	for  all  other	 names).   For
	       example,	 ``clear  Lock''  will	remove	all any keys that were
	       bound to the shift lock modifier.

       1madd 4m22mMODIFIERNAME24m 1m= 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 4m...0m
	       This  adds  all	keys  containing  the  given  keysyms  to  the
	       indicated  modifier  map.  The keysym names are evaluated after
	       all input expressions  are  read	 to  make  it  easy  to	 write
	       expressions to swap keys (see the EXAMPLES section).

       1mremove 4m22mMODIFIERNAME24m 1m= 4m22mKEYSYMNAME24m 4m...0m
	       This  removes  all  keys	 containing the given keysyms from the
	       indicated modifier map.	 Unlike	 1madd,	 22mthe	 keysym	 names	are
	       evaluated  as  the  line is read in.  This allows you to remove
	       keys from a modifier without having to worry about  whether  or
	       not they have been reassigned.

       1mpointer = default0m
	       This  sets the pointer map back to its default settings (button
	       1 generates a code of 1, button 2 generates a 2, etc.).

       1mpointer = 4m22mNUMBER24m 4m...0m
	       This sets the pointer  map  to  contain	the  indicated	button
	       codes.	The list always starts with the first physical button.

       Lines that begin with an exclamation point (!) are taken as comments.

       If you want to change the binding of a  modifier	 key,  you  must  also
       remove it from the appropriate modifier map.

1mEXAMPLES0m
       Many  pointers are designed such that the first button is pressed using
       the index finger	 of  the  right	 hand.	 People	 who  are  left-handed
       frequently find that it is more comfortable to reverse the button codes
       that get generated so that the primary  button  is  pressed  using  the
       index  finger  of  the  left  hand.   This  could be done on a 3 button
       pointer as follows:

	    %  xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"


       Many applications support the notion of Meta keys (similar  to  Control
       keys  except that Meta is held down instead of Control).	 However, some
       servers do not have a Meta keysym in the default keymap table,  so  one
       needs  to  be added by hand.  The following command will attach Meta to
       the Multi-language key (sometimes labeled Compose Character).  It  also
       takes  advantage	 of  the  fact	that applications that need a Meta key
       simply need to get the keycode and don't require the keysym  to	be  in
       the  first  column  of  the keymap table.  This means that applications
       that are looking for a Multi_key (including the default	modifier  map)
       won't notice any change.

	    %  xmodmap -e "keysym Multi_key = Multi_key Meta_L"


       Similarly,  some	 keyboards  have  an Alt key but no Meta key.  In that
       case the following may be useful:

	    %  xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"


       One of the more simple, yet convenient, uses of 4mxmodmap24m is to  set	the
       keyboard's   "rubout"  key  to  generate	 an  alternate	keysym.	  This
       frequently  involves  exchanging	 Backspace  with  Delete  to  be  more
       comfortable  to	the user.  If the 4mttyModes24m resource in 4mxterm24m is set as
       well, all terminal emulator windows will use the same key  for  erasing
       characters:

	    %  xmodmap -e "keysym BackSpace = Delete"
	    %  echo "XTerm*ttyModes:  erase ^?" | xrdb -merge


       Some keyboards do not automatically generate less than and greater than
       characters when the comma and period keys are  shifted.	 This  can  be
       remedied	 with  4mxmodmap24m  by	 resetting  the	 bindings for the comma and
       period with the following scripts:

	    !
	    ! make shift-, be < and shift-. be >
	    !
	    keysym comma = comma less
	    keysym period = period greater


       One of  the  more  irritating  differences  between  keyboards  is  the
       location	 of  the Control and Shift Lock keys.  A common use of 4mxmodmap0m
       is to swap these two keys as follows:

	    !
	    ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
	    !
	    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
	    remove Control = Control_L
	    keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
	    keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
	    add Lock = Caps_Lock
	    add Control = Control_L


       The 4mkeycode24m command is useful for assigning the same keysym to multiple
       keycodes.   Although  unportable,  it  also  makes it possible to write
       scripts that can reset the keyboard to a known  state.	The  following
       script  sets  the  backspace  key  to generate Delete (as shown above),
       flushes all existing caps lock bindings, makes the CapsLock  key	 be  a
       control	key, make F5 generate Escape, and makes Break/Reset be a shift
       lock.

	    !
	    ! On the HP, the following keycodes have key caps as listed:
	    !
	    !	  101  Backspace
	    !	   55  Caps
	    !	   14  Ctrl
	    !	   15  Break/Reset
	    !	   86  Stop
	    !	   89  F5
	    !
	    keycode 101 = Delete
	    keycode 55 = Control_R
	    clear Lock
	    add Control = Control_R
	    keycode 89 = Escape
	    keycode 15 = Caps_Lock
	    add Lock = Caps_Lock

       Every time a 1mkeycode 22mexpression is evaluated, the  server  generates  a
       4mMappingNotify24m  event  on  every client.  This can cause some thrashing.
       All of the changes  should  be  batched	together  and  done  at	 once.
       Clients	that  receive  keyboard	 input and ignore 4mMappingNotify24m events
       will not notice any changes made to keyboard mappings.

       4mXmodmap24m should generate "add" and  "remove"	 expressions  automatically
       whenever a keycode that is already bound to a modifier is changed.

       There  should be a way to have the 4mremove24m expression accept keycodes as
       well as keysyms for those times when you really mess up your  mappings.

XNEST(1)							      XNEST(1)



1mNAME0m
       Xnest - a nested X server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXnest 22m[-options]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXnest24m is a client and a server.  4mXnest24m is a client of the  real  server
       which  manages windows and graphics requests on its behalf.  4mXnest24m is a
       server to its own clients.  4mXnest24m manages windows and graphics requests
       on  their  behalf.  To these clients 4mXnest24m appears to be a conventional
       server.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mXnest24m  supports   all   standard   options	 of   the   sample   server
       implementation.	 For  more details, please see the manual page on your
       system for 4mXserver24m.	 The following additional arguments  are  supported
       as well.

       1m-display 4m22mstring0m
	   This	 option	 specifies  the	 display  name of the real server that
	   4mXnest24m should try to connect with.  If it is  not  provided  on	the
	   command  line  4mXnest24m  will read the 4mDISPLAY24m environment variable in
	   order to find out the same information.

       1m-sync0m
	   This option tells 4mXnest24m to  synchronize	 its  window  and  graphics
	   operations  with  the  real	server.	  This	is a useful option for
	   debugging, but it will slow down the performance considerably.   It
	   should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

       1m-full0m
	   This option tells 4mXnest24m to utilize full regeneration of real server
	   objects and reopen a new connection to the real  server  each  time
	   the	nested	server	regenerates.  The sample server implementation
	   regenerates all objects in the server when the last client of  this
	   server  terminates.	 When this happens, 4mXnest24m by default maintains
	   the same top level window and the same real	server	connection  in
	   each	 new  generation.  If the user selects full regeneration, even
	   the top level window and the connection to the real server will  be
	   regenerated for each server generation.

       1m-class 4m22mstring0m
	   This	 option	 specifies  the	 default  visual  class	 of the nested
	   server.  It is similar to the 4m-cc24m option from the set  of  standard
	   options  except  that  it will accept a string rather than a number
	   for the visual class specification.	The string must be one of  the
	   following   six   values:   4mStaticGray24m,	  4mGrayScale24m,   4mStaticColor24m,
	   4mPseudoColor24m, 4mTrueColor24m, or 4mDirectColor24m.  If both,  4m-class24m  and  4m-cc0m
	   options  are	 specified, the last instance of either option assumes
	   precedence.	The class of the default visual of the	nested	server
	   need not be the same as the class of the default visual of the real
	   server; although, it has to be supported by the real	 server.   See
	   4mxdpyinfo24m  for a list of supported visual classes on the real server
	   before starting 4mXnest24m.	If the user chooses a static class, all the
	   colors  in  the default colormap will be preallocated.  If the user
	   chooses a dynamic class, colors in the  default  colormap  will  be
	   available to individual clients for allocation.

       1m-depth 4m22mint0m
	   This	 option	 specifies  the	 default  visual  depth	 of the nested
	   server.  The depth of the default visual of the nested server  need
	   not	be  the	 same  as  the depth of the default visual of the real
	   server; although, it has to be supported by the real	 server.   See
	   4mxdpyinfo24m  for  a list of supported visual depths on the real server
	   before starting 4mXnest24m.

       1m-sss0m
	   This option tells 4mXnest24m to  use	 the  software	screen	saver.	 By
	   default  4mXnest24m	will  use  the screen saver that corresponds to the
	   hardware screen saver in the real server.   Of  course,  even  this
	   screen saver is software generated since 4mXnest24m does not control any
	   actual hardware.  However, it is treated as a hardware screen saver
	   within the sample server code.

       1m-geometry 4m22mWxH+X+Y0m
	   This	 option	 specifies geometry parameters for the top level 4mXnest0m
	   windows.  These windows corresponds to  the	root  windows  of  the
	   nested  server.   The  width	 and height specified with this option
	   will be the maximum width  and  height  of  each  top  level	 4mXnest0m
	   window.   4mXnest24m	 will  allow  the user to make any top level window
	   smaller, but it will not actually change the	 size  of  the	nested
	   server  root	 window.   As of yet, there is no mechanism within the
	   sample server implementation to change the size of the root	window
	   after screen initialization.	 In order to do so, one would probably
	   need to extend the X protocol.  Therefore, it is  not  likely  that
	   this	 will  be  available  any  time	 soon.	 If this option is not
	   specified 4mXnest24m will choose width and  height  to  be  3/4  of	the
	   dimensions of the root window of the real server.

       1m-bw 4m22mint0m
	   This	 option	 specifies  the	 border	 width	of the top level 4mXnest0m
	   window.  The integer parameter must	be  a  positive	 number.   The
	   default border width is 1.

       1m-name 4m22mstring0m
	   This	 option specifies the name of the top level 4mXnest24m window.	The
	   default value is the program name.

       1m-scrns 4m22mint0m
	   This option specifies the number of screens to create in the nested
	   server.   For  each	screen, 4mXnest24m will create a separate top level
	   window.  Each screen is referenced by the number after the  dot  in
	   the client display name specification.  For example, 4mxterm24m 4m-display0m
	   4m:1.124m will open an 4mxterm24m  client  in  the  nested  server  with  the
	   display  number  4m:124m on the second screen.  The number of screens is
	   limited by the hard coded constant in the server sample code	 which
	   is usually 3.

       1m-install0m
	   This	 option	 tells	4mXnest24m  to	do its own colormap installation by
	   bypassing the real window manager.  For it  to  work	 properly  the
	   user	 will  probably	 have  to  temporarily	quit  the  real window
	   manager.  By default 4mXnest24m will keep the nested client window whose
	   colormap   should   be   installed	in  the	 real  server  in  the
	   4mWM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS24m property of the top	 level	4mXnest24m  window.   If
	   this	 colormap is of the same visual type as the root window of the
	   nested server, 4mXnest24m will associate  this  colormap  with  the	top
	   level  4mXnest24m  window  as  well.	 Since this does not have to be the
	   case,   window   managers   should	look	primarily    at	   the
	   4mWM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS24m  property  rather  than the colormap associated
	   with the top level 4mXnest24m window.   Unfortunately,  window  managers
	   are	not  very  good at doing that yet so this option might come in
	   handy.

       1m-parent 4m22mwindow_id0m
	   This option tells 4mXnest24m to use the 4mwindow_id24m  as  the  root  window
	   instead  of	creating  a  window.  This  option  is used by the xrx
	   xnestplugin.

       1m-noinput0m
	   This option disables input for 4mXnest24m, running  it  in  a  view-only
	   mode.

1mUSAGE0m
       Starting	 up  4mXnest24m	 is as simple as starting up 4mxclock24m from a terminal
       emulator.  If a user wishes to run 4mXnest24m on the same workstation as the
       real  server,  it  is important that the nested server is given its own
       listening socket address.  Therefore, if	 there	is  a  server  already
       running	on  the	 user's	 workstation, 4mXnest24m will have to be started up
       with a new display number.  Since there is usually  no  more  than  one
       server  running	on  a  workstation, specifying 4mXnest24m 4m:124m on the command
       line will be sufficient for most users.	For each server running on the
       workstation  the	 display number needs to be incremented by one.	 Thus,
       if you wish to start another 4mXnest24m, you will need to type 4mXnest24m  4m:224m  on
       the command line.

       To  run	clients in the nested server each client needs to be given the
       same display number as the nested server.  For example, 4mxterm24m  4m-display0m
       4m:124m will start up an 4mxterm24m in the first nested server and 4mxterm24m 4m-display0m
       4m:224m will start an 4mxterm24m in the second nested  server  from  the	 example
       above.	Additional  clients  can  be started from these 4mxterm24ms in each
       nested server.

1mXNEST AS A CLIENT0m
       4mXnest24m behaves and looks to the real server and other  real	clients	 as
       another	real  client.  It is a rather demanding client, however, since
       almost any window or graphics request from a nested client will	result
       in  a  window  or  graphics  request  from  4mXnest24m  to  the real server.
       Therefore, it is desirable that 4mXnest24m and the  real	 server	 are  on  a
       local  network,	or even better, on the same machine.  As of now, 4mXnest0m
       assumes that the real server supports the shape extension.  There is no
       way  to	turn  off  this assumption dynamically.	 4mXnest24m can be compiled
       without the shape extension built in, and in that case the real	server
       need  not  support  it.	 The dynamic shape extension selection support
       should be considered in further development of 4mXnest24m.

       Since 4mXnest24m need not use the  same	default	 visual	 as  the  the  real
       server,	the  top  level	 window of the 4mXnest24m client always has its own
       colormap.   This	 implies  that	other  windows'	 colors	 will  not  be
       displayed  properly while the keyboard or pointer focus is in the 4mXnest0m
       window, unless the real server has support for more than one  installed
       colormap	 at  any time.	The colormap associated with the top window of
       the 4mXnest24m client need not be the appropriate colormap that	the  nested
       server  wants  installed in the real server.  In the case that a nested
       client attempts to install a colormap of a different  visual  from  the
       default	visual	of the nested server, 4mXnest24m will put the top window of
       this nested client and all other top windows of the nested clients that
       use  the same colormap into the 4mWM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS24m property of the top
       level 4mXnest24m window on the real server.  Thus, it is important that	the
       real  window  manager  that manages the 4mXnest24m top level window looks at
       the 4mWM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS24m property rather than  the  colormap	 associated
       with  the top level 4mXnest24m window.  Since most window managers appear to
       not implement this convention properly as of yet, 4mXnest24m can	 optionally
       do  direct installation of colormaps into the real server bypassing the
       real window manager.  If the user chooses this option,  it  is  usually
       necessary  to temporarily disable the real window manager since it will
       interfere with the 4mXnest24m scheme of colormap installation.

       Keyboard and pointer control procedures of the nested server change the
       keyboard and pointer control parameters of the real server.  Therefore,
       after 4mXnest24m is started up, it will	change	the  keyboard  and  pointer
       controls	 of  the  real	server	to its own internal defaults.  Perhaps
       there should be a command line option to	 tell  4mXnest24m  to  inherit	the
       keyboard	 and  pointer  control	parameters from the real server rather
       than imposing its own.  This is a future consideration.

1mXNEST AS A SERVER0m
       4mXnest24m as a server looks exactly like a real server to its own  clients.
       For  the	 clients  there	 is no way of telling if they are running on a
       real or a nested server.

       As already mentioned, 4mXnest24m is a very  user	 friendly  server  when	 it
       comes  to  customization.   4mXnest24m will pick up a number of command line
       arguments that can configure its default visual class and depth, number
       of  screens,  etc.   In	the  future, 4mXnest24m should read a customization
       input file to provide even greater freedom and simplicity in  selecting
       the  desired  layout.   Unfortunately,  there is no support for backing
       store and save under as of yet, but this should also be	considered  in
       the future development of 4mXnest24m.

       The  only  apparent  intricacy  from the users' perspective about using
       4mXnest24m as a server is the selection of fonts.  4mXnest24m  manages  fonts  by
       loading	them locally and then passing the font name to the real server
       and asking it to load that font remotely.   This	 approach  avoids  the
       overload	 of  sending  the glyph bits across the network for every text
       operation, although it is really a bug.	The proper  implementation  of
       fonts  should  be  moved	 into  the  4mos24m  layer. The consequence of this
       approach is that the user will have to worry about two  different  font
       paths - a local one for the nested server and a remote one for the real
       server - since 4mXnest24m does not propagate  its  font	path  to  the  real
       server.	 The  reason  for this is because real and nested servers need
       not run on the same file system which makes the two font paths mutually
       incompatible.   Thus,  if there is a font in the local font path of the
       nested server, there is no guarantee  that  this	 font  exists  in  the
       remote  font  path  of the real server.	4mXlsfonts24m client, if run on the
       nested server will list fonts in the local font path and if run on  the
       real server will list fonts in the remote font path.  Before a font can
       be successfully opened by the nested server it has to  exist  in	 local
       and  remote  font  paths.  It is the users' responsibility to make sure
       that this is the case.

1mBUGS0m
       Won't run well on servers supporting different  visual  depths.	 Still
       crashes randomly.  Probably has some memory leaks.

XON(1)									XON(1)



1mNAME0m
       xon - start an X program on a remote machine

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxon 22mremote-host [-access] [-debug] [-name window-name] [-nols] [-screen
       screen-no] [-user user-name] [command ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXon24m runs the specified  command  (default  xterm  -ls)  on	the  remote
       machine	using rsh, remsh, or rcmd.  Xon passes the DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY
       and XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variables to the remote command.

       When no command is specified, xon runs 'xterm  -ls'.   It  additionally
       specifies the application name to be 'xterm-4mremote-host24m' and the window
       title to be '-fIremote-host4m'.0m

       Xon can only work when the remote host will allow you to log in without
       a password, by having an entry in the .rhosts file permitting access.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Note  that  the	options	 follow	 the remote host name (as they do with
       rlogin).


       1m-access0m
	      Runs xhost locally to add the remote host	 to  the  host	access
	      list  in	the  X	server.	 This won't work unless xhost is given
	      permission to modify the access list.

       1m-debug 22mNormally, xon disconnects the remote process from stdin,  stdout
	      and  stderr  to  eliminate  the  daemon  processes which usually
	      connect them across the network.	Specifying the	1m-debug  22moption
	      leaves  them  connected  so  that error messages from the remote
	      execution are sent back to the originating host.

       1m-name window-name0m
	      This specifies a different application name and window title for
	      the default command (xterm).

       1m-nols	22mNormally  xon  passes  the  -ls option to the remote xterm; this
	      option suspends that behaviour.

       1m-screen screen-no0m
	      This changes the screen number of the DISPLAY variable passed to
	      the remote command.

       1m-user user-name0m
	      By  default,  xon	 simply	 uses rsh/remsh/rcmd to connect to the
	      remote machine using the same user name as on the local machine.
	      This option cause xon to specify an alternative user name.  This
	      will not work unless you have authorization to access the remote
	      account,	by  placing  an	 appropriate entry in the remote users
	      .rhosts file.

1mBUGS0m
       Xon can get easily confused when the remote-host, user-name or  various
       environment variable values contain white space.

       Xon  has	 no way to send the appropriate X authorization information to
       the remote host.

1mSUMMARY0m
       The  4mxprop24m utility is for displaying window and font properties in an X
       server.	One  window  or	 font  is  selected  using  the	 command  line
       arguments  or  possibly	in  the	 case  of a window, by clicking on the
       desired window.	A list of properties  is  then	given,	possibly  with
       formatting information.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-help	 22mPrint out a summary of command line options.


       1m-grammar0m
	       Print out a detailed grammar for all command line options.


       1m-id 4m22mid24m	 This  argument	 allows	 the  user  to	select	window 4mid24m on the
	       command line rather than using the pointer to select the target
	       window.	 This is very useful in debugging X applications where
	       the target window is not mapped to the screen or where the  use
	       of  the	pointer	 might	be  impossible	or  interfere with the
	       application.


       1m-name 4m22mname0m
	       This argument allows the user to specify that the window	 named
	       4mname24m is the target window on the command line rather than using
	       the pointer to select the target window.


       1m-font 4m22mfont0m
	       This argument allows the user to specify that the properties of
	       font 4mfont24m should be displayed.


       1m-root	 22mThis  argument  specifies  that  X's  root window is the target
	       window.	This is useful in situations where the root window  is
	       completely obscured.


       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This  argument  allows you to specify the server to connect to;
	       see 4mX(7)24m.


       1m-len 4m22mn24m	 Specifies that at most 4mn24m bytes of any property should  be	 read
	       or displayed.


       1m-notype 22mSpecifies  that  the  type	of  each  property  should  not	 be
	       displayed.


       1m-fs 4m22mfile0m
	       Specifies that file 4mfile24m should be used as	a  source  of  more
	       formats for properties.


       1m-frame	 22mSpecifies that when selecting a window by hand (i.e. if none of
	       1m-name22m, 1m-root22m, or 1m-id 22mare given), look  at	 the  window  manager
	       frame (if any) instead of looking for the client window.


       1m-remove 4m22mproperty-name0m
	       Specifies  the  name  of	 a  property  to  be  removed from the
	       indicated window.


       1m-set 4m22mproperty-name24m 4mvalue0m
	       Specifies the name of a property and a property	value,	to  be
	       set on the indicated window.


       1m-spy	 22mExamine  window properties forever, looking for property change
	       events.


       1m-f 4m22mname24m 4mformat24m 1m[4m22mdformat24m1m]0m
	       Specifies that the 4mformat24m for 4mname24m should be  4mformat24m  and	 that
	       the 4mdformat24m for 4mname24m should be 4mdformat24m.  If 4mdformat24m is missing,
	       " = $0+\n" is assumed.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       For each of these properties, its value on the selected window or  font
       is  printed  using  the	supplied formatting information if any.	 If no
       formatting information is supplied, internal defaults are used.	 If  a
       property	 is  not defined on the selected window or font, "not defined"
       is printed as the value for that property.   If	no  property  list  is
       given,  all the properties possessed by the selected window or font are
       printed.

       A window may be selected in one of four ways.  First,  if  the  desired
       window  is  the	root  window,  the -root argument may be used.	If the
       desired window is not the root window, it may be selected in  two  ways
       on the command line, either by id number such as might be obtained from
       4mxwininfo24m, or by name if the window possesses a name.  The -id  argument
       selects a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must start with
       0x) while the -name argument selects a window by name.

       The last way to select a window does not involve the  command  line  at
       all.   If  none	of  -font,  -id,  -name,  and  -root  are specified, a
       crosshairs cursor is displayed and the user is allowed  to  choose  any
       visible	window	by  pressing any pointer button in the desired window.
       If it is desired to display properties  of  a  font  as	opposed	 to  a
       window, the -font argument must be used.

       Other  than  the	 above	four  arguments	 and  the  -help  argument for
       obtaining help, and the -grammar argument for listing the full  grammar
       for  the command line, all the other command line arguments are used in
       specifying both the format of the properties to be displayed and how to
       display	them.	The  -len 4mn24m argument specifies that at most 4mn24m bytes of
       any given property will be read and  displayed.	 This  is  useful  for
       example	when  displaying the cut buffer on the root window which could
       run to several pages if displayed in full.

       Normally each property name is displayed by printing first the property
       name  then  its	type  (if  it  has one) in parentheses followed by its
       value.  The -notype argument specifies that property types  should  not
       be  displayed.  The -fs argument is used to specify a file containing a
       list of formats for properties while the -f argument is used to specify
       the format for one property.

       The  formatting	information  for  a  property actually consists of two
       parts, a 4mformat24m  and  a  4mdformat24m.   The  4mformat24m  specifies  the  actual
       formatting  of  the  property  (i.e., is it made up of words, bytes, or
       longs?, etc.) while the 4mdformat24m specifies how the  property	 should	 be
       displayed.

       The   following	paragraphs  describe  how  to  construct  4mformat24ms	and
       4mdformat24ms.  However, for the vast  majority	of  users  and	uses,  this
       should  not  be	necessary as the built in defaults contain the 4mformat24ms
       and 4mdformat24ms necessary to display  all  the	 standard  properties.	 It
       should  only  be	 necessary  to	specify	 4mformat24ms and 4mdformat24ms if a new
       property is being dealt with or the user dislikes the standard  display
       format.	New users especially are encouraged to skip this part.

       A  4mformat24m  consists of one of 0, 8, 16, or 32 followed by a sequence of
       one or more format characters.  The 0, 8, 16, or 32 specifies how  many
       bits  per  field	 there	are  in	 the property.	Zero is a special case
       meaning use the field size information  associated  with	 the  property
       itself.	(This is only needed for special cases like type INTEGER which
       is actually three different types depending on the size of  the	fields
       of the property.)

       A  value	 of  8	means that the property is a sequence of bytes while a
       value of 16 would mean that the property is a sequence of  words.   The
       difference  between  these  two	lies  in the fact that the sequence of
       words will be byte swapped while the sequence of bytes will not be when
       read  by	 a  machine  of	 the  opposite	byte order of the machine that
       originally wrote the property.  For more information on how  properties
       are formatted and stored, consult the Xlib manual.

       Once  the  size	of  the	 fields has been specified, it is necessary to
       specify the type of each field (i.e., is it an integer,	a  string,  an
       atom, or what?)	This is done using one format character per field.  If
       there are more fields in the property than format characters  supplied,
       the  last character will be repeated as many times as necessary for the
       extra fields.  The format characters and their meaning are as follows:

       a      The field holds an atom number.  A field of this type should  be
	      of size 32.

       b      The  field  is  an boolean.  A 0 means false while anything else
	      means true.

       c      The field is an unsigned number, a cardinal.

       i      The field is a signed integer.

       m      The field is a set of bit flags, 1 meaning on.

       s      This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of  the
	      property	represent  a sequence of bytes.	 This format character
	      is only usable with a field size of 8 and is most often used  to
	      represent a string.

       t      This  field and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of the
	      property represent an internationalized text string. This format
	      character	 is  only usable with a field size of 8. The string is
	      assumed to be in an ICCCM compliant encoding and is converted to
	      the current locale encoding before being output.

       x      The  field is a hex number (like 'c' but displayed in hex - most
	      useful for displaying window ids and the like)

       An example 4mformat24m is 32ica which is the format for a property of  three
       fields  of 32 bits each, the first holding a signed integer, the second
       an unsigned integer, and the third an atom.

       The format of a 4mdformat24m unlike that of a 4mformat24m is not so  rigid.   The
       only  limitations  on a 4mdformat24m is that one may not start with a letter
       or a dash.  This is so that it can be  distinguished  from  a  property
       name  or	 an  argument.	 A 4mdformat24m is a text string containing special
       characters instructing that various fields be printed at various points
       in  a  manner  similar  to  the	formatting string used by printf.  For
       example, the 4mdformat24m " is ( $0, $1 \)\n" would render the POINT  3,	 -4
       which has a 4mformat24m of 32ii as " is ( 3, -4 )\n".

       Any  character  other  than  a  $,  ?, \, or a ( in a 4mdformat24m prints as
       itself.	To print out one of $, ?, \, or ( precede  it  by  a  \.   For
       example, to print out a $, use \$.  Several special backslash sequences
       are provided as shortcuts.  \n will cause a  newline  to	 be  displayed
       while  \t  will	cause  a  tab to be displayed.	\4mo24m where 4mo24m is an octal
       number will display character number 4mo24m.

       A $ followed by a number 4mn24m causes field number 4mn24m to be displayed.   The
       format  of the displayed field depends on the formatting character used
       to describe it in the corresponding 4mformat24m.	 I.e.,	if  a  cardinal	 is
       described by 'c' it will print in decimal while if it is described by a
       'x' it is displayed in hex.

       If the field is not present in the property (this is possible with some
       properties),  <field  not  available>  is  displayed instead.  $4mn24m+ will
       display field number 4mn24m then a comma then field number 4mn24m+1 then	 another
       comma  then  ...	 until	the  last  field  defined.   If field 4mn24m is not
       defined, nothing is displayed.  This is useful for a property that is a
       list of values.

       A  ?  is	 used  to  start  a  conditional expression, a kind of if-then
       statement.  ?4mexp24m(4mtext24m) will display 4mtext24m if and only if  4mexp24m	 evaluates
       to  non-zero.   This is useful for two things.  First, it allows fields
       to be displayed if and only if a flag is set.  And second, it allows  a
       value  such  as a state number to be displayed as a name rather than as
       just a number.  The syntax of 4mexp24m is as follows:

       4mexp24m	   ::= 4mterm24m | 4mterm24m=4mexp24m | !4mexp0m

       4mterm24m   ::= 4mn24m | $4mn24m | m4mn0m

       The ! operator is a logical ``not'', changing 0 to 1 and	 any  non-zero
       value  to  0.   =  is  an  equality operator.  Note that internally all
       expressions are evaluated as 32 bit numbers  so	-1  is	not  equal  to
       65535.	=  returns  1  if  the	two  values are equal and 0 if not.  4mn0m
       represents the constant value 4mn24m while $4mn24m represents the value of  field
       number  4mn24m.	 m4mn24m  is 1 if flag number 4mn24m in the first field having format
       character 'm' in the corresponding 4mformat24m is 1, 0 otherwise.

       Examples: ?m3(count: $3\n) displays field 3 with a label	 of  count  if
       and   only   if	 flag	number	 3   (count   starts  at  0!)  is  on.
       ?$2=0(True)?!$2=0(False) displays the inverted value of field  2	 as  a
       boolean.

       In  order  to  display  a  property,  4mxprop24m	 needs	both a 4mformat24m and a
       4mdformat24m.  Before 4mxprop24m uses its default values of a 4mformat24m of 32x and a
       4mdformat24m  of " = { $0+ }\n", it searches several places in an attempt to
       find more specific formats.  First, a search is made using the name  of
       the  property.	If  this fails, a search is made using the type of the
       property.  This allows type STRING  to  be  defined  with  one  set  of
       formats	while  allowing property WM_NAME which is of type STRING to be
       defined with a different format.	 In this way, the display formats  for
       a given type can be overridden for specific properties.

       The  locations  searched are in order: the format if any specified with
       the property name (as in 8x WM_NAME), the formats defined by -f options
       in  last	 to first order, the contents of the file specified by the -fs
       option if any, the contents of the file specified by the	 environmental
       variable	 XPROPFORMATS  if  any,	 and  finally 4mxprop24m's built in file of
       formats.

       The format of the files	referred  to  by  the  -fs  argument  and  the
       XPROPFORMATS variable is one or more lines of the following form:

       4mname24m 4mformat24m [4mdformat24m]

       Where  4mname24m	 is  either  the  name of a property or the name of a type,
       4mformat24m is the 4mformat24m to be used with 4mname24m and 4mdformat24m is the 4mdformat24m to
       be used with 4mname24m.	If 4mdformat24m is not present, " = $0+\n" is assumed.

       screen should be set to.	 To find out what sizes are available, use the
       4m-q24m option, which reports the sizes available, the current rotation, and
       the possible rotations and reflections.	The default size is the	 first
       size  specified	in  the	 list.	 The  4m-o24m option is used to specify the
       orientation of the screen, and can be  one  of  4m"normal24m  4minverted24m  4mleft0m
       4mright24m 4m024m 4m124m 4m224m 4m3"24m.

       The 4m-x24m option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the X axis.
       The 4m-y24m option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the Y axis.
       Reflection is applied after rotation.

       The  4m-help24m	option	prints	out  a usage summary.  The 4m--verbose24m option
       tells you what xrandr is doing, selects for events, and tells you  when
       events are received to enable debugging.

1mNAME0m
       xrdb - X server resource database utility

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxrdb 22m[-option ...] [4mfilename24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXrdb24m  is  used  to	get  or	 set  the  contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER
       property on the root  window  of	 screen	 0,  or	 the  SCREEN_RESOURCES
       property	 on  the  root	window	of  any	 or all screens, or everything
       combined.  You would normally run this  program	from  your  X  startup
       file.

       Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties
       to get user preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications.
       Having  this  information  in  the server (where it is available to all
       clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of
       X  that	required  you to maintain 4mdefaults24m files on every machine that
       you might use.  It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without
       editing files.

       The  RESOURCE_MANAGER  property is used for resources that apply to all
       screens of the display.	The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on  each	screen
       specifies  additional  (or  overriding)	resources  to be used for that
       screen.	(When there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES  is  normally
       not  used,  all	resources  are	just  placed  in  the RESOURCE_MANAGER
       property.)

       The file specified by 4mfilename24m (or the contents from standard input	 if
       -  or  no  filename  is	given)	is  optionally	passed	through	 the C
       preprocessor  with  the	following  symbols  defined,  based   on   the
       capabilities of the server being used:

       1mSERVERHOST=4m22mhostname0m
	       the hostname portion of the display to which you are connected.

       1mSRVR_4m22mname0m
	       the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal  identifier.
	       For	   example,	   "my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu"	       becomes
	       SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.

       1mHOST=4m22mhostname0m
	       the same as 1mSERVERHOST22m.

       1mDISPLAY_NUM=4m22mnum0m
	       the number of the display on the server host.

       1mCLIENTHOST=4m22mhostname0m
	       the name of the host on which 4mxrdb24m is running.

       1mCLNT_4m22mname0m
	       the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal  identifier.
	       For  example, "expo.lcs.mit.edu" becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.

       1mRELEASE=4m22mnum0m
	       the vendor release number for the server.   The	interpretation
	       of this number will vary depending on VENDOR.

       1mREVISION=4m22mnum0m
	       the   X	 protocol  minor  version  supported  by  this	server
	       (currently 0).

       1mVERSION=4m22mnum0m
	       the X protocol major version supported by this  server  (should
	       always be 11).

       1mVENDOR="4m22mvendor24m1m"0m
	       a string literal specifying the vendor of the server.

       1mVNDR_4m22mname0m
	       the  VENDOR  name  string  turned into a legal identifier.  For
	       example, "MIT X Consortium" becomes VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.

       1mEXT_4m22mname0m
	       A symbol is defined for each protocol  extension	 supported  by
	       the  server.  Each extension string name is turned into a legal
	       identifier.  For example, "X3D-PEX" becomes EXT_X3D_PEX.

       1mNUM_SCREENS=4m22mnum0m
	       the total number of screens.

       1mSCREEN_NUM=4m22mnum0m
	       the number of the current screen (from zero).

       1mBITS_PER_RGB=4m22mnum0m
	       the number of significant bits in an RGB	 color	specification.
	       This is the log base 2 of the number of distinct shades of each
	       primary that the hardware can generate.	Note that  it  usually
	       is not related to PLANES.

       1mCLASS=4m22mvisualclass0m
	       one   of	  StaticGray,	GrayScale,  StaticColor,  PseudoColor,
	       TrueColor, DirectColor.	This is the visual class of  the  root
	       window.

       1mCLASS_4m22mvisualclass24m1m=4m22mvisualid0m
	       the  visual  class  of the root window in a form you can 4m#ifdef0m
	       on.  The value is the numeric id of the visual.

       1mCOLOR	 22mdefined only if  CLASS  is	one  of	 StaticColor,  PseudoColor,
	       TrueColor, or DirectColor.

       1mCLASS_4m22mvisualclass24m1m_4m22mdepth24m1m=4m22mnum0m
	       A  symbol  is defined for each visual supported for the screen.
	       The symbol includes the class of the visual and its depth;  the
	       value  is  the  numeric	id  of	the visual.  (If more than one
	       visual has the same class and depth,  the  numeric  id  of  the
	       first one reported by the server is used.)

       1mHEIGHT=4m22mnum0m
	       the height of the root window in pixels.

       1mWIDTH=4m22mnum0m
	       the width of the root window in pixels.

       1mPLANES=4m22mnum0m
	       the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window.

       1mX_RESOLUTION=4m22mnum0m
	       the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       1mY_RESOLUTION=4m22mnum0m
	       the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       SRVR_4mname24m, CLNT_4mname24m, VNDR_4mname24m, and EXT_4mname24m identifiers are formed by
       changing all characters other than letters and digits into  underscores
       (_).

       Lines  that  begin  with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored and may be
       used as comments.

       Note that since 4mxrdb24m can read from standard input, it can  be  used	 to
       the  change the contents of properties directly from a terminal or from
       a shell script.

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mxrdb24m program accepts the following options:

       1m-help	 22mThis option (or any unsupported  option)  will  cause  a  brief
	       description  of	the  allowable	options	 and  parameters to be
	       printed.

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the X server to be used;  see  4mX(7)24m.	 It
	       also specifies the screen to use for the 4m-screen24m option, and it
	       specifies  the  screen  from  which  preprocessor  symbols  are
	       derived for the 4m-global24m option.

       1m-all	 22mThis option indicates that operation should be performed on the
	       screen-independent  resource  property  (RESOURCE_MANAGER),  as
	       well  as	 the  screen-specific  property	 (SCREEN_RESOURCES) on
	       every screen  of	 the  display.	 For  example,	when  used  in
	       conjunction  with  4m-query24m,	the  contents of all properties are
	       output.	For 4m-load24m, 4m-override24m and 4m-merge24m,	 the  input  file  is
	       processed  once	for each screen.  The resources which occur in
	       common in the output for every screen are collected, and	 these
	       are applied as the screen-independent resources.	 The remaining
	       resources are applied for each individual per-screen  property.
	       This the default mode of operation.

       1m-global 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the	operation  should  only	 be
	       performed on the screen-independent RESOURCE_MANAGER  property.

       1m-screen 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the	operation  should  only	 be
	       performed on  the  SCREEN_RESOURCES  property  of  the  default
	       screen of the display.

       1m-screens0m
	       This option indicates that the operation should be performed on
	       the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each screen  of	 the  display.
	       For  4m-load24m,	 4m-override24m	 and 4m-merge24m, the input file is processed
	       for each screen.

       1m-n	 22mThis option indicates that changes to the specified	 properties
	       (when  used with 4m-load24m, 4m-override24m or 4m-merge24m) or to the resource
	       file (when used with 4m-edit24m) should be  shown  on  the  standard
	       output, but should not be performed.

       1m-quiet	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  warning  about duplicate entries
	       should not be displayed.

       1m-cpp 4m22mfilename0m
	       This option  specifies  the  pathname  of  the  C  preprocessor
	       program to be used.  Although 4mxrdb24m was designed to use CPP, any
	       program that acts as a filter and accepts the -D,  -I,  and  -U
	       options may be used.

       1m-nocpp	 22mThis  option  indicates that 4mxrdb24m should not run the input file
	       through a preprocessor before loading it into properties.

       1m-symbols0m
	       This option indicates that the symbols that are defined for the
	       preprocessor should be printed onto the standard output.

       1m-query	 22mThis   option  indicates  that  the	 current  contents  of	the
	       specified  properties  should  be  printed  onto	 the  standard
	       output.	 Note  that  since  preprocessor commands in the input
	       resource file are part of the  input  file,  not	 part  of  the
	       property,  they	won't  appear  in the output from this option.
	       The  1m-edit  22moption	can  be	 used  to  merge  the  contents	 of
	       properties  back	 into the input resource file without damaging
	       preprocessor commands.

       1m-load	 22mThis option indicates that the input should be  loaded  as	the
	       new  value  of the specified properties, replacing whatever was
	       there (i.e.  the	 old  contents	are  removed).	 This  is  the
	       default action.

       1m-override0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  the  input  should  be added to,
	       instead of replacing, the current  contents  of	the  specified
	       properties.  New entries override previous entries.

       1m-merge	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the	input  should be merged and
	       lexicographically  sorted  with,	 instead  of  replacing,   the
	       current contents of the specified properties.

       1m-remove 22mThis  option  indicates that the specified properties should be
	       removed from the server.

       1m-retain 22mThis option indicates that the server should be instructed	not
	       to  reset if 4mxrdb24m is the first client.  This never be necessary
	       under normal conditions, since 4mxdm24m and 4mxinit24m always act as  the
	       first client.

       1m-edit 4m22mfilename0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  the  contents  of	 the specified
	       properties should be edited into the given file, replacing  any
	       values  already	listed	there.	This allows you to put changes
	       that you have made to your defaults  back  into	your  resource
	       file, preserving any comments or preprocessor lines.

       1m-backup 4m22mstring0m
	       This  option  specifies a suffix to be appended to the filename
	       used with 1m-edit 22mto generate a backup file.

       1m-D4m22mname[=value]0m
	       This option is passed through to the preprocessor and  is  used
	       to define symbols for use with conditionals such as

       1m-U4m22mname24m	 This  option  is passed through to the preprocessor and is used
	       to remove any definitions of this symbol.

       1m-I4m22mdirectory0m
	       This option is passed through to the preprocessor and  is  used
	       to  specify a directory to search for files that are referenced
	       with 4m#include.0m

XREFRESH(1)							   XREFRESH(1)



1mNAME0m
       xrefresh - refresh all or part of an X screen

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxrefresh 22m[-option ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXrefresh24m  is  a simple X program that causes all or part of your screen
       to be repainted.	 This is useful when system messages  have  messed  up
       your  screen.  4mXrefresh24m maps a window on top of the desired area of the
       screen and then immediately unmaps it, causing  refresh	events	to  be
       sent  to	 all applications.  By default, a window with no background is
       used, causing all applications to repaint ``smoothly.''	 However,  the
       various options can be used to indicate that a solid background (of any
       color) or the root window background should be used instead.

1mARGUMENTS0m
       1m-white	   22mUse a white background.  The screen  just	 appears  to  flash
		 quickly, and then repaint.


       1m-black	   22mUse  a  black  background	 (in effect, turning off all of the
		 electron  guns	 to  the  tube).    This   can	 be   somewhat
		 disorienting as everything goes black for a moment.


       1m-solid 4m22mcolor0m
		 Use a solid background of the specified color.	 Try green.


       1m-root	   22mUse the root window background.


       1m-none	   22mThis is the default.  All of the windows simply repaint.


       1m-geometry 4m22mWxH+X+Y0m
		 Specifies  the	 portion  of  the  screen to be repainted; see
		 4mX(7)24m.


       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
		 This  argument	 allows	  you	to   specify  the  server  and
		 screen to refresh; see 4mX(7)24m.

1mX DEFAULTS0m
       The 4mxrefresh24m program uses the routine 4mXGetDefault(3X)24m to read defaults,
       so its resource names are all capitalized.


       1mBlack22m, 1mWhite22m, 1mSolid22m, 1mNone22m, 1mRoot0m
	       Determines what sort of window background to use.


       1mGeometry0m
	       Determines the area to refresh.	Not very useful.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       DISPLAY - To get default host and display number.

1mNAME0m
       xrx - RX helper program

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxrx 22m[-4mtoolkitoption24m ...] 4mfilename0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The helper program may be  used	with  any  Web	browser	 to  interpret
       documents in the RX MIME type format and start remote applications.

       1mxrx  22mreads	in the RX document specified by its 4mfilename24m, from which it
       gets the list of services the application wants to use. Based  on  this
       information,   1mxrx  22msets  the  various  requested  services,  including
       creating authorization keys if your  X  server  supports	 the  SECURITY
       extension.  It  then  passes  the  relevant data, such as the X display
       name, to the application through an HTTP GET request of the  associated
       CGI  script.  The  Web server then executes the CGI script to start the
       application. The client runs on the web server host connected to your X
       server.


1mINSTALLATION0m
       You  need  to  configure	 your web browser to use 1mxrx 22mfor RX documents.
       Generally the following line in your $HOME/.mailcap is enough:
	     application/x-rx; xrx %s

       However, you may need to refer to your web browser's documentation  for
       exact instructions on configuring helper applications.

       Once  correctly	configured,  your  browser  will  activate  the helper
       program	whenever  you  retrieve	 any  document	of   the   MIME	  type
       4mapplication/x-rx24m.


1mOPTIONS0m
       The  4mxrx24m  helper  program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command
       line options such as:

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       This option specifies a resource string to be used.  There  may
	       be several instances of this option on the command line.


1mRESOURCES0m
       The application class name of the 4mxrx24m program is Xrx and it understands
       the following application resource names and classes:

       1mxrxHasFirewallProxy (22mclass 1mXrxHasFirewallProxy)0m
	       Specifies whether an X server  firewall	proxy  (see  xfwp)  is
	       running and should be used. Default is ``False.''

       1mxrxInternalWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxInternalWebServers)0m
	       The  web	 servers  for which the X server firewall proxy should
	       not  be	used  (only  relevant  when   1mxrxHasFirewallProxy   22mis
	       ``True'').  Its	value  is a comma separated list of mask/value
	       pairs to be used to filter internal web servers, based on their
	       address.	 The mask part specifies which segments of the address
	       are to be considered and the  value  part  specifies  what  the
	       result should match. For instance the following list:

		     255.255.255.0/198.112.45.0, 255.255.255.0/198.112.46.0

	       matches	the  address sets: 198.112.45.* and 198.112.46.*. More
	       precisely, the test is (address & mask) == value.

       1mxrxFastWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxFastWebServers)0m
	       The web servers for which LBX should not be used. The  resource
	       value  is  a  list  of  address mask/value pairs, as previously
	       described.

       1mxrxTrustedWebServers (22mclass 1mXrxTrustedWebServers)0m
	       The web servers from which remote applications should be run as
	       trusted	clients.  The default is to run remote applications as
	       untrusted clients. The resource value  is  a  list  of  address
	       mask/value pairs, as previously described.


1mENVIRONMENT0m
       The  4mxrx24m  helper program uses the standard X environment variables such
       as ``DISPLAY'' to get the default X server host and display number.  If
       the RX document requests X-UI-LBX service and the default X server does
       not advertise the LBX extension, 4mxrx24m  will	look  for  the	environment
       variable ``XREALDISPLAY'' to get a second address for your X server and
       look for the LBX extension there. When  running	your  browser  through
       4mlbxproxy24m  you  will	 need  to set XREALDISPLAY to the actual address of
       your server if you wish remote applications  to	be  able  to  use  LBX
       across the Internet.

       If  the RX document requests XPRINT service, 4mxrx24m looks for the variable
       ``XPRINTER'' to get the printer name and X Print server address to use.
       If  the	server	address is not specified as part of XPRINTER, 4mxrx24m uses
       the first one specified through the variable ``XPSERVERLIST''  when  it
       is  set.	 When  it is not 4mxrx24m then tries to use the video server as the
       print server. If the printer name is not specified  via	XPRINTER,  4mxrx0m
       looks  for  it  in  the	variables  ``PDPRINTER'', then ``LPDEST'', and
       finally ``PRINTER'',

       Finally, if  you	 are  using  a	firewall  proxy,  4mxrx24m  will  look	for
       ``PROXY_MANAGER''  to  get  the	address	 of  your  proxy  manager (see
       proxymngr). When not specified it will use ":6500" as the default.


1mKNOWN BUG0m
       When an authorization key is created for a remote  application  to  use
       the  X  Print service, the helper program has to create the key with an
       infinite timeout since nobody knows when the application will  actually
       connect	to  the	 X  Print  server. Therefore, in this case, the helper
       program stays around to revoke the key when the application  goes  away
       (that  is  when	its video key expires). However, if the helper program
       dies unexpectedly the print authorization key will never get revoked.

1mNAME0m
       Xserver - X Window System display server

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mX 22m[option ...]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mX24m  is  the	generic name for the X Window System display server.  It is
       frequently a link or a  copy  of	 the  appropriate  server  binary  for
       driving the most frequently used server on a given machine.

1mSTARTING THE SERVER0m
       The  X  server  is  usually  started from the X Display Manager program
       4mxdm24m(1) or a similar display manager program.  This utility is run  from
       the  system  boot  files	 and takes care of keeping the server running,
       prompting for  usernames	 and  passwords,  and  starting	 up  the  user
       sessions.

       Installations  that run more than one window system may need to use the
       4mxinit24m(1) utility instead of a display manager.  However, 4mxinit24m is to be
       considered  a tool for building startup scripts and is not intended for
       use by end users.  Site administrators are  1mstrongly  22murged	 to  use  a
       display manager, or build other interfaces for novice users.

       The  X  server  may  also  be started directly by the user, though this
       method is usually reserved for  testing	and  is	 not  recommended  for
       normal  operation.   On	some  platforms,  the  user  must have special
       permission to start the X  server,  often  because  access  to  certain
       devices (e.g. 4m/dev/mouse24m) is restricted.

       When  the  X server starts up, it typically takes over the display.  If
       you are running on a workstation whose console is the display, you  may
       not be able to log into the console while the server is running.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Many  X	servers	 have  device-specific	command line options.  See the
       manual pages for the individual servers for more	 details;  a  list  of
       server-specific manual pages is provided in the SEE ALSO section below.

       All of the X servers accept the command line options  described	below.
       Some  X	servers	 may have alternative ways of providing the parameters
       described here, but the values provided via the	command	 line  options
       should override values specified via other mechanisms.

       1m:4m22mdisplaynumber0m
	       The  X server runs as the given 4mdisplaynumber24m, which by default
	       is 0.  If multiple X servers are to  run	 simultaneously	 on  a
	       host,  each must have a unique display number.  See the DISPLAY
	       NAMES section of the 4mX24m(7) manual page to learn how	to  specify
	       which display number clients should try to use.

       1m-a 4m22mnumber0m
	       sets  pointer  acceleration  (i.e.  the	ratio  of  how much is
	       reported to how much the user actually moved the pointer).

       1m-ac	 22mdisables host-based access control mechanisms.  Enables  access
	       by  any host, and permits any host to modify the access control
	       list.  Use with extreme caution.	 This option exists  primarily
	       for running test suites remotely.

       1m-audit 4m22mlevel0m
	       sets  the  audit	 trail level.  The default level is 1, meaning
	       only connection rejections are reported.	 Level 2  additionally
	       reports	all  successful	 connections and disconnects.  Level 4
	       enables messages	 from  the  SECURITY  extension,  if  present,
	       including  generation  and  revocation  of  authorizations  and
	       violations of the security policy.  Level 0 turns off the audit
	       trail.  Audit lines are sent as standard error output.

       1m-auth 4m22mauthorization-file0m
	       specifies  a  file which contains a collection of authorization
	       records used to authenticate access.  See also the  4mxdm24m(1)	and
	       4mXsecurity24m(7) manual pages.

       1mbc	 22mdisables certain kinds of error checking, for bug compatibility
	       with previous releases (e.g., to work around bugs in R2 and  R3
	       xterms and toolkits).  Deprecated.

       1m-bs	 22mdisables backing store support on all screens.

       1m-br	 22msets  the  default	root  window  to solid black instead of the
	       standard root weave pattern.

       1m-c	 22mturns off key-click.

       1mc 4m22mvolume0m
	       sets key-click volume (allowable range: 0-100).

       1m-cc 4m22mclass0m
	       sets the visual class for the root  window  of  color  screens.
	       The  class  numbers  are	 as  specified in the X protocol.  Not
	       obeyed by all servers.

       1m-co 4m22mfilename0m
	       sets  name   of	 RGB   color   database.    The	  default   is
	       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb24m.

       1m-core	 22mcauses the server to generate a core dump on fatal errors.

       1m-deferglyphs 4m22mwhichfonts0m
	       specifies  the  types  of  fonts	 for  which  the server should
	       attempt to use deferred glyph loading.  4mwhichfonts24m can  be	all
	       (all fonts), none (no fonts), or 16 (16 bit fonts only).

       1m-dpi 4m22mresolution0m
	       sets  the  resolution for all screens, in dots per inch.	 To be
	       used when the server cannot determine the screen	 size(s)  from
	       the hardware.

       1mdpms	 22menables   DPMS   (display  power  management  services),  where
	       supported.  The default state  is  platform  and	 configuration
	       specific.

       1m-dpms	 22mdisables DPMS (display power management services).	The default
	       state is platform and configuration specific.

       1m-f 4m22mvolume0m
	       sets feep (bell) volume (allowable range: 0-100).

       1m-fc 4m22mcursorFont0m
	       sets default cursor font.

       1m-fn 4m22mfont0m
	       sets the default font.

       1m-fp 4m22mfontPath0m
	       sets the search path for fonts.	This path is a comma separated
	       list  of	 directories  which  the  X  server  searches for font
	       databases.  See the FONTS section of this manual page for  more
	       information and the default list.

       1m-help	 22mprints a usage message.

       1m-I	 22mcauses all remaining command line arguments to be ignored.

       1m-maxbigreqsize 4m22msize0m
	       sets the maxmium big request to 4msize24m MB.

       1m-nolisten 4m22mtrans-type0m
	       disables a transport type.  For example, TCP/IP connections can
	       be disabled with 1m-nolisten tcp22m.   This  option  may	 be  issued
	       multiple	 times	to  disable  listening	to different transport
	       types.

       1m-noreset0m
	       prevents a server reset when  the  last	client	connection  is
	       closed.	 This  overrides  a  previous  1m-terminate 22mcommand line
	       option.

       1m-p 4m22mminutes0m
	       sets screen-saver pattern cycle time in minutes.

       1m-pn	 22mpermits the server to continue running if it fails to establish
	       all  of its well-known sockets (connection points for clients),
	       but establishes at least one.  This option is set by default.

       1m-nopn	 22mcauses the server to exit if it fails to establish all  of	its
	       well-known sockets (connection points for clients).

       1m-r	 22mturns off auto-repeat.

       1mr	 22mturns on auto-repeat.

       1m-s 4m22mminutes0m
	       sets screen-saver timeout time in minutes.

       1m-su	 22mdisables save under support on all screens.

       1m-t 4m22mnumber0m
	       sets  pointer  acceleration threshold in pixels (i.e. after how
	       many pixels pointer acceleration should take effect).

       1m-terminate0m
	       causes the server to terminate  at  server  reset,  instead  of
	       continuing  to run.  This overrides a previous 1m-noreset 22mcommand
	       line option.

       1m-to 4m22mseconds0m
	       sets default connection timeout in seconds.

       1m-tst	 22mdisables  all   testing   extensions   (e.g.,   XTEST,   XTrap,
	       XTestExtension1, RECORD).

       1mtty4m22mxx24m	 ignored, for servers started the ancient way (from init).

       1mv	 22msets video-off screen-saver preference.

       1m-v	 22msets video-on screen-saver preference.

       1m-wm	 22mforces   the   default  backing-store  of  all  windows  to	 be
	       WhenMapped.  This is a backdoor way of getting backing-store to
	       apply  to  all  windows.	 Although all mapped windows will have
	       backing store, the backing store attribute  value  reported  by
	       the server for a window will be the last value established by a
	       client.	If it has never been set by a client, the server  will
	       report the default value, NotUseful.  This behavior is required
	       by the X protocol,  which  allows  the  server  to  exceed  the
	       client's	 backing store expectations but does not provide a way
	       to tell the client that it is doing so.

       1m-x 4m22mextension0m
	       loads the specified extension at init.  This  is	 a  no-op  for
	       most implementations.

       1m[+-]xinerama0m
	       enables(+)  or disables(-) the XINERAMA extension.  The default
	       state is platform and configuration specific.

1mSERVER DEPENDENT OPTIONS0m
       Some X servers accept the following options:

       1m-ld 4m22mkilobytes0m
	       sets the data space limit of the server to the specified number
	       of  kilobytes.  A value of zero makes the data size as large as
	       possible.  The default value of -1 leaves the data space	 limit
	       unchanged.

       1m-lf 4m22mfiles0m
	       sets  the  number-of-open-files	limit  of  the	server	to the
	       specified number.  A value of zero makes the limit as large  as
	       possible.   The default value of -1 leaves the limit unchanged.

       1m-ls 4m22mkilobytes0m
	       sets the stack space limit  of  the  server  to	the  specified
	       number  of  kilobytes.  A value of zero makes the stack size as
	       large as possible.  The default value of -1  leaves  the	 stack
	       space limit unchanged.

       1m-logo	 22mturns  on the X Window System logo display in the screen-saver.
	       There is currently no way to change this from a client.

       1mnologo	 22mturns off the X Window System logo display in the screen-saver.
	       There is currently no way to change this from a client.

       1m-render default22m|1mmono22m|1mgray22m|1mcolor	 22msets  the color allocation policy that
	       will be used by the render extension.

	       4mdefault24m selects the default	 policy	 defined  for  the  display
		       depth of the X server.

	       4mmono24m    don't use any color cell.

	       4mgray24m    use	 a  gray  map  of  13  color cells for the X render
		       extension.

	       4mcolor24m   use a color cube of at most 4*4*4 colors  (that  is	 64
		       color cells).

       1m-dumbSched0m
	       disables	 smart	scheduling on platforms that support the smart
	       scheduler.

       1m-schedInterval 4m22minterval0m
	       sets the smart  scheduler's  scheduling	interval  to  4minterval0m
	       milliseconds.

1mXDMCP OPTIONS0m
       X  servers  that	 support  XDMCP have the following options.  See the 4mX0m
       4mDisplay24m 4mManager24m 4mControl24m 4mProtocol24m specification for more information.

       1m-query 4m22mhostname0m
	       enables	XDMCP  and  sends  Query  packets  to  the   specified
	       4mhostname24m.

       1m-broadcast0m
	       enable  XDMCP  and  broadcasts  BroadcastQuery  packets	to the
	       network.	 The first responding display manager will  be	chosen
	       for the session.

       1m-multicast [4m22maddress24m 1m[4m22mhop24m 4mcount24m1m]]0m
	       Enable  XDMCP  and  multicast  BroadcastQuery  packets  to  the
	       network.	 The first responding display manager  is  chosen  for
	       the session.  If an address is specified, the multicast is sent
	       to that address.	 If no address is specified, the multicast  is
	       sent to the default XDMCP IPv6 multicast group.	If a hop count
	       is specified, it is used as  the	 maximum  hop  count  for  the
	       multicast.   If no hop count is specified, the multicast is set
	       to a maximum of 1 hop, to  prevent  the	multicast  from	 being
	       routed beyond the local network.

       1m-indirect 4m22mhostname0m
	       enables	XDMCP  and send IndirectQuery packets to the specified
	       4mhostname24m.

       1m-port 4m22mport-number0m
	       uses the specified 4mport-number24m for XDMCP  packets,	instead	 of
	       the  default.  This option must be specified before any -query,
	       -broadcast, -multicast, or -indirect options.

       1m-from 4m22mlocal-address0m
	       specifies the local address to  connect	from  (useful  if  the
	       connecting  host	 has multiple network interfaces).  The 4mlocal-0m
	       4maddress24m may be expressed in any form  acceptable  to  the  host
	       platform's 4mgethostbyname24m(3) implementation.

       1m-once	 22mcauses  the	 server	 to  terminate (rather than reset) when the
	       XDMCP session ends.

       1m-class 4m22mdisplay-class0m
	       XDMCP has an additional	display	 qualifier  used  in  resource
	       lookup  for  display-specific  options.	 This option sets that
	       value, by default it is "MIT-Unspecified" (not  a  very	useful
	       value).

       1m-cookie 4m22mxdm-auth-bits0m
	       When  testing  XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1,  a	private	 key is shared
	       between the server and the manager.  This option sets the value
	       of that private data (not that it is very private, being on the
	       command line!).

       1m-displayID 4m22mdisplay-id0m
	       Yet another XDMCP specific value, this one allows  the  display
	       manager	to  identify  each  display  so that it can locate the
	       shared key.

1mXKEYBOARD OPTIONS0m
       X servers that support the XKEYBOARD (a.k.a.  "XKB")  extension	accept
       the  following options.	All layout files specified on the command line
       must be located in the  XKB  base  directory  or	 a  subdirectory,  and
       specified  as  the  relative  path  from	 the  XKB base directory.  The
       default XKB base directory is 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb24m.

       1m[+-]kb	 22menables(+) or disables(-) the XKEYBOARD extension.

       1m[+-]accessx 22m[ 4mtimeout24m [ 4mtimeout_mask24m [ 4mfeedback24m [ 4moptions_mask24m ] ] ] ]
	       enables(+) or disables(-) AccessX key sequences.

       1m-xkbdir 4m22mdirectory0m
	       base directory for keyboard layout files.  This option  is  not
	       available  for setuid X servers (i.e., when the X server's real
	       and effective uids are different).

       1m-ar1 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       sets the autorepeat delay (length of time in milliseconds  that
	       a key must be depressed before autorepeat starts).

       1m-ar2 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       sets  the  autorepeat  interval (length of time in milliseconds
	       that should elapse between autorepeat-generated keystrokes).

       1m-noloadxkb0m
	       disables	 loading  of  an  XKB  keymap  description  on	server
	       startup.

       1m-xkbdb 4m22mfilename0m
	       uses 4mfilename24m for default keyboard keymaps.

       1m-xkbmap 4m22mfilename0m
	       loads keyboard description in 4mfilename24m on server startup.

1mSECURITY EXTENSION OPTIONS0m
       X  servers  that	 support  the  SECURITY extension accept the following
       option:

       1m-sp 4m22mfilename0m
	       causes the server to attempt to read and interpret filename  as
	       a  security  policy  file with the format described below.  The
	       file is read at server startup and reread at each server reset.

       The  syntax  of	the security policy file is as follows.	 Notation: "*"
       means zero or more occurrences of the preceding element, and "+"	 means
       one or more occurrences.	 To interpret <foo/bar>, ignore the text after
       the /; it is used to distinguish between instances of <foo> in the next
       section.

       <policy file> ::= <version line> <other line>*

       <version line> ::= <string/v> '\n'

       <other line > ::= <comment> | <access rule> | <site policy> | <blank line>

       <comment> ::= # <not newline>* '\n'

       <blank line> ::= <space> '\n'

       <site policy> ::= sitepolicy <string/sp> '\n'

       <access rule> ::= property <property/ar> <window> <perms> '\n'

       <property> ::= <string>

       <window> ::= any | root | <required property>

       <required property> ::= <property/rp> | <property with value>

       <property with value> ::= <property/rpv> = <string/rv>

       <perms> ::= [ <operation> | <action> | <space> ]*

       <operation> ::= r | w | d

       <action> ::= a | i | e

       <string> ::= <dbl quoted string> | <single quoted string> | <unqouted string>

       <dbl quoted string> ::= <space> " <not dqoute>* " <space>

       <single quoted string> ::= <space> ' <not squote>* ' <space>

       <unquoted string> ::= <space> <not space>+ <space>

       <space> ::= [ ' ' | '\t' ]*

       Character sets:

       <not newline> ::= any character except '\n'
       <not dqoute>  ::= any character except "
       <not squote>  ::= any character except '
       <not space>   ::= any character except those in <space>

       The semantics associated with the above syntax are as follows.

       <version	 line>,	 the first line in the file, specifies the file format
       version.	 If the server does not recognize the version  <string/v>,  it
       ignores	the  rest of the file.	The version string for the file format
       described here is "version-1" .

       Once past the <version line>, lines that do not match the above	syntax
       are ignored.

       <comment> lines are ignored.

       <sitepolicy> lines are currently ignored.  They are intended to specify
       the site policies used by the XC-QUERY-SECURITY-1 authorization method.

       <access	rule>  lines  specify how the server should react to untrusted
       client requests that affect the X Window property named	<property/ar>.
       The  rest  of  this  section describes the interpretation of an <access
       rule>.

       For an <access rule> to apply to a  given  instance  of	<property/ar>,
       <property/ar>  must  be	on  a  window  that  is	 in the set of windows
       specified by <window>.	If  <window>  is  any,	the  rule  applies  to
       <property/ar>  on any window.  If <window> is root, the rule applies to
       <property/ar> only on root windows.

       If <window> is <required property>, the following apply.	 If  <required
       property> is a <property/rp>, the rule applies when the window also has
       that <property/rp>, regardless of its value.  If <required property> is
       a  <property  with  value>,  <property/rpv>  must  also	have the value
       specified by <string/rv>.  In this case, the property  must  have  type
       STRING  and  format  8,	and should contain one or more null-terminated
       strings.	 If any of the strings match <string/rv>, the rule applies.

       The definition of  string  matching  is	simple	case-sensitive	string
       comparison with one elaboration: the occurrence of the character '*' in
       <string/rv> is a wildcard meaning  "any	string."   A  <string/rv>  can
       contain	multiple  wildcards anywhere in the string.  For example, "x*"
       matches strings that begin with x, "*x" matches strings that  end  with
       x,  "*x*" matches strings containing x, and "x*y*" matches strings that
       start with x and subsequently contain y.

       There may be multiple <access rule> lines for  a	 given	<property/ar>.
       The  rules  are	tested in the order that they appear in the file.  The
       first rule that applies is used.

       <perms> specify operations that untrusted clients may attempt, and  the
       actions that the server should take in response to those operations.

       <operation>  can	 be r (read), w (write), or d (delete).	 The following
       table shows how X Protocol property requests map to these operations in
       The Open Group server implementation.

       GetProperty    r, or r and d if delete = True
       ChangeProperty w
       RotateProperties	   r and w
       DeleteProperty d
       ListProperties none, untrusted clients can always list all properties

       <action>	 can  be  a  (allow),  i  (ignore), or e (error).  Allow means
       execute the request as if it had	 been  issued  by  a  trusted  client.
       Ignore means treat the request as a no-op.  In the case of GetProperty,
       ignore means return an empty property value  if	the  property  exists,
       regardless of its actual value.	Error means do not execute the request
       and return a BadAtom error with the atom	 set  to  the  property	 name.
       Error  is  the  default	action for all properties, including those not
       listed in the security policy file.

       An <action> applies to all <operation>s that follow it, until the  next
       <action>	 is  encountered.   Thus,  irwad  means ignore read and write,
       allow delete.

       GetProperty and RotateProperties may do multiple operations (r  and  d,
       or  r  and  w).	If different actions apply to the operations, the most
       severe action is applied to the whole  request;	there  is  no  partial
       request	execution.   The severity ordering is: allow < ignore < error.
       Thus, if the <perms> for	 a  property  are  ired	 (ignore  read,	 error
       delete),	 and an untrusted client attempts GetProperty on that property
       with delete = True, an error is returned, but  the  property  value  is
       not.   Similarly, if any of the properties in a RotateProperties do not
       allow both read and write, an error is returned	without	 changing  any
       property values.

       Here is an example security policy file.

1mNETWORK CONNECTIONS0m
       The  X  server  supports	 client	 connections  via a platform-dependent
       subset of the following transport types: TCPIP,	Unix  Domain  sockets,
       DECnet,	and  several  varieties	 of  SVR4  local connections.  See the
       DISPLAY NAMES section of the 4mX24m(7) manual page to learn how	to  specify
       which transport type clients should try to use.

1mGRANTING ACCESS0m
       The  X  server  implements a platform-dependent subset of the following
       authorization protocols: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1,  XDM-
       AUTHORIZATION-2,	 SUN-DES-1,  and MIT-KERBEROS-5.  See the 4mXsecurity24m(7)
       manual page for information on the operation of these protocols.

       Authorization data required by the above protocols  is  passed  to  the
       server  in  a  private  file  named with the 1m-auth 22mcommand line option.
       Each time the server is about to accept the first  connection  after  a
       reset  (or  when	 the server is starting), it reads this file.  If this
       file  contains  any  authorization  records,  the  local	 host  is  not
       automatically allowed access to the server, and only clients which send
       one  of	the  authorization  records  contained	in  the	 file  in  the
       connection  setup  information  will  be	 allowed  access.  See the 4mXau0m
       manual page for a description of the binary format of this  file.   See
       4mxauth24m(1) for maintenance of this file, and distribution of its contents
       to remote hosts.

       The X server also uses a host-based access control  list	 for  deciding
       whether	or  not	 to  accept  connections  from clients on a particular
       machine.	 If no other authorization mechanism is being used, this  list
       initially  consists  of the host on which the server is running as well
       as any machines listed in  the  file  4m/etc/X24m1mn4m22m.hosts24m,  where  1mn	22mis  the
       display	number	of  the	 server.  Each line of the file should contain
       either  an  Internet  hostname  (e.g.  expo.lcs.mit.edu)	 or  a	DECnet
       hostname	 in  double  colon format (e.g. hydra::) or a complete name in
       the format 4mfamily24m:4mname24m as described in the 4mxhost24m(1) manual page.	There
       should be no leading or trailing spaces on any lines.  For example:

	       joesworkstation
	       corporate.company.com
	       star::
	       inet:bigcpu
	       local:

       Users  can  add	or  remove  hosts from this list and enable or disable
       access control using the 4mxhost24m command from the  same  machine  as	the
       server.

       If  the	X  FireWall  Proxy  (4mxfwp24m) is being used without a sitepolicy,
       host-based authorization must be turned on for clients to  be  able  to
       connect	to  the	 X  server  via	 the  4mxfwp24m.   If 4mxfwp24m is run without a
       configuration file and thus no sitepolicy is defined, if 4mxfwp24m is  using
       an  X  server  where  xhost  +  has  been  run  to  turn off host-based
       authorization checks, when a client tries to connect to this  X	server
       via  4mxfwp24m, the X server will deny the connection.  See 4mxfwp24m(1) for more
       information about this proxy.

       The X protocol  intrinsically  does  not	 have  any  notion  of	window
       operation  permissions  or  place any restrictions on what a client can
       do; if a program can connect to a display,  it  has  full  run  of  the
       screen.	 X  servers  that  support  the SECURITY extension fare better
       because clients can be designated untrusted via the authorization  they
       use to connect; see the 4mxauth24m(1) manual page for details.  Restrictions
       are imposed on untrusted clients that curtail the mischief they can do.
       See  the	 SECURITY extension specification for a complete list of these
       restrictions.

       Sites that have better authentication and authorization	systems	 might
       wish  to	 make  use  of	the  hooks  in the libraries and the server to
       provide additional security models.

1mSIGNALS0m
       The X server attaches special meaning to the following signals:

       4mSIGHUP24m  This  signal  causes  the  server	to   close   all   existing
	       connections,  free all resources, and restore all defaults.  It
	       is sent by the display manager whenever the  main  user's  main
	       application (usually an 4mxterm24m or window manager) exits to force
	       the server to clean up and prepare for the next user.

       4mSIGTERM24m This signal causes the server to exit cleanly.

       4mSIGINT24m  This signal causes the server to exit  after  cleaning  up	the
	       DDX/hardware  state.   This  type  of exit is not as clean as a
	       SIGTERM, but is faster, and far better than a SIGKILL.

       4mSIGUSR124m This signal is used quite differently from either of the above.
	       When  the  server  starts, it checks to see if it has inherited
	       SIGUSR1 as SIG_IGN instead of the usual SIG_DFL.	 In this case,
	       the  server  sends a SIGUSR1 to its parent process after it has
	       set up the various connection schemes.  4mXdm24m uses  this  feature
	       to recognize when connecting to the server is possible.

1mFONTS0m
       The  X  server  can  obtain  fonts  from	 directories  and/or from font
       servers.	 The list of directories and font servers the  X  server  uses
       when trying to open a font is controlled by the 4mfont24m 4mpath24m.

       The default font path is __default_font_path__ .

       The  font  path	can be set with the 1m-fp 22moption or by 4mxset24m(1) after the
       server has started.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       This program is used to set various  user  preference  options  of  the
       display.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the server to use; see 4mX(7)24m.


       1mb	 22mThe	 1mb  22moption	 controls bell volume, pitch and duration.  This
	       option accepts up to three numerical  parameters,  a  preceding
	       dash(-),	 or  a	'on/off' flag.	If no parameters are given, or
	       the 'on' flag is used, the system defaults will	be  used.   If
	       the  dash  or 'off' are given, the bell will be turned off.  If
	       only one numerical parameter is given, the bell volume will  be
	       set  to	that value, as a percentage of its maximum.  Likewise,
	       the second numerical parameter specifies	 the  bell  pitch,  in
	       hertz, and the third numerical parameter specifies the duration
	       in milliseconds.	 Note that not all hardware can vary the  bell
	       characteristics.	  The X server will set the characteristics of
	       the bell as closely as it can to the user's specifications.


       1mbc	 22mThe 1mbc 22moption controls 4mbug24m 4mcompatibility24m mode in the server, if
	       possible;  a preceding dash(-) disables the mode, otherwise the
	       mode is enabled.	 Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal values in
	       some  protocol  requests,  and pre-R4 servers did not correctly
	       generate errors in these cases.	Such clients, when run against
	       an  R4  server,	will terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to
	       operate	 correctly.    Bug   compatibility   mode   explicitly
	       reintroduces  certain bugs into the X server, so that many such
	       clients can still be run.  This mode should be used with	 care;
	       new  application	 development  should  be  done	with this mode
	       disabled.  The server must support  the	MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD
	       protocol extension in order for this option to work.

       1mc	 22mThe	 1mc  22moption	 controls  key	click.	 This option can take an
	       optional value, a preceding dash(-), or an 'on/off'  flag.   If
	       no  parameter  or  the  'on' flag is given, the system defaults
	       will be used. If the dash or 'off' flag is used, keyclick  will
	       be  disabled.  If a value from 0 to 100 is given, it is used to
	       indicate volume, as a percentage of the maximum.	 The X	server
	       will  set the volume to the nearest value that the hardware can
	       support.


       1m-dpms	 22mThe 1m-dpms 22moption disables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       1m+dpms	 22mThe 1m+dpms 22moption enables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       1mdpms 4m22mflags...0m
	       The 1mdpms 22moption allows the DPMS (Energy Star) parameters to	 be
	       set.   The option can take up to three numerical values, or the
	       `force' flag followed by	 a  DPMS  state.   The	`force'	 flags
	       forces  the  server  to	immediately  switch  to the DPMS state
	       specified.  The DPMS state can be one of `standby',  `suspend',
	       `off',  or `on'.	 When numerical values are given, they set the
	       inactivity period (in units of seconds) before the three	 modes
	       are  activated.	 The  first  value  given is for the `standby'
	       mode, the second is for the `suspend' mode, and	the  third  is
	       for  the	 `off'	mode.  Setting these values implicitly enables
	       the DPMS features.  A value of zero disables a particular mode.

       1mfp= 4m22mpath,...0m
	       The  1mfp=  22msets  the	 font path to the entries given in the path
	       argument.  The entries are interpreted by the  server,  not  by
	       the  client.  Typically they are directory names or font server
	       names, but the interpretation is server-dependent.

       1mfp default0m
	       The 1mdefault 22margument causes the font path to be  reset  to	the
	       server's default.

       1mfp rehash0m
	       The  1mrehash 22margument resets the font path to its current value,
	       causing the server to reread the font databases in the  current
	       font  path.   This is generally only used when adding new fonts
	       to a font directory (after running 4mmkfontdir24m  to  recreate	the
	       font database).


       1m-fp 22mor 1mfp-0m
	       The  1m-fp  22mand 1mfp- 22moptions remove elements from the current font
	       path.  They must be  followed  by  a  comma-separated  list  of
	       entries.


       1m+fp 22mor 1mfp+0m
	       This  1m+fp  22mand  1mfp+  22moptions prepend and append elements to the
	       current font path, respectively.	 They must be  followed	 by  a
	       comma-separated list of entries.


       1mled	 22mThe	 1mled	22moption controls the keyboard LEDs.  This controls the
	       turning on or off of one or all of the  LEDs.   It  accepts  an
	       optional	 integer, a preceding dash(-) or an 'on/off' flag.  If
	       no parameter or the 'on' flag is given, all LEDs are turned on.
	       If  a  preceding	 dash or the flag 'off' is given, all LEDs are
	       turned off.  If a value between 1 and 32	 is  given,  that  LED
	       will  be	 turned	 on  or	 off  depending	 on the existence of a
	       preceding dash.	A common LED which can be  controlled  is  the
	       ``Caps  Lock''  LED.   ``xset  led  3''	would  turn led #3 on.
	       ``xset -led 3'' would turn it off.  The particular  LED	values
	       may refer to different LEDs on different hardware.


       1mm	 22mThe 1mm 22moption controls the mouse parameters.  The parameters for
	       the mouse are `acceleration' and `threshold'.  The acceleration
	       can  be	specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction.  The
	       mouse, or whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go
	       `acceleration'	times  as  fast	 when  it  travels  more  than
	       `threshold' pixels in a short time.  This way, the mouse can be
	       used  for precise alignment when it is moved slowly, yet it can
	       be set to travel across the screen in a flick of the wrist when
	       desired.	  One  or  both	 parameters  for  the  1mm 22moption can be
	       omitted, but if only one is given, it will  be  interpreted  as
	       the  acceleration.   If	no parameters or the flag 'default' is
	       used, the system defaults will be set.


       1mp	 22mThe 1mp 22moption controls pixel color values.  The	 parameters  are
	       the   color   map   entry   number  in  decimal,	 and  a	 color
	       specification.  The root background colors may  be  changed  on
	       some  servers  by  altering  the	 entries  for  BlackPixel  and
	       WhitePixel.  Although these are often 0 and 1,  they  need  not
	       be.   Also,  a  server  may  choose  to	allocate  those colors
	       privately, in which case an error will be generated.   The  map
	       entry must not be a read-only color, or an error will result.


       1mr	 22mThe	 1mr  22moption controls the autorepeat.  If a preceding dash or
	       the 'off' flag is used, autorepeat will	be  disabled.	If  no
	       parameters  or  the  'on'  flag	is  used,  autorepeat  will be
	       enabled.	 If a specific keycode is specified  as	 a  parameter,
	       autorepeat  for	that  keycode  is enabled or disabled.	If the
	       server  supports	 the  XFree86-Misc  extension,	or   the   XKB
	       extension, then a parameter of 'rate' is accepted and should be
	       followed	 by  zero,  one	 or  two  numeric  values.  The	 first
	       specifies  the  delay  before  autorepeat starts and the second
	       specifies the  repeat  rate.   In  the  case  that  the	server
	       supports	 the  XKB  extension,  the  delay  is  the  number  of
	       milliseconds before autorepeat starts,  and  the	 rate  is  the
	       number  of  repeats  per	 second.   If the rate or delay is not
	       given, it will be set to the default value.

	       Example: The following  command	will  set  the	delay  to  200
	       milliseconds and the repeat rate to 10 per second:

		   xset r rate 200 10


       1ms	 22mThe	 1ms  22moption	 lets you set the screen saver parameters.  This
	       option	accepts	  up   to   two	  numerical   parameters,    a
	       'blank/noblank'	flag,  an  'expose/noexpose' flag, an 'on/off'
	       flag, an 'activate/reset' flag, or the 'default' flag.	If  no
	       parameters  or  the  'default' flag is used, the system will be
	       set to its default screen saver characteristics.	 The  'on/off'
	       flags  simply  turn  the screen saver functions on or off.  The
	       'activate' flag forces activation of screen saver even  if  the
	       screen  saver  had  been	 turned	 off.  The 'reset' flag forces
	       deactivation of screen saver if it is active.  The 'blank' flag
	       sets  the preference to blank the video (if the hardware can do
	       so) rather than display a background pattern,  while  'noblank'
	       sets  the preference to display a pattern rather than blank the
	       video.  The 'expose' flag sets the preference to	 allow	window
	       exposures  (the	server	can  freely  discard window contents),
	       while 'noexpose' sets the preference to	disable	 screen	 saver
	       unless  the  server  can regenerate the screens without causing
	       exposure events.	 The length  and  period  parameters  for  the
	       screen  saver  function	determines how long the server must be
	       inactive for screen saving  to  activate,  and  the  period  to
	       change  the background pattern to avoid burn in.	 The arguments
	       are specified in seconds.  If only one numerical	 parameter  is
	       given, it will be used for the length.


       1mq	 22mThe 1mq 22moption gives you information on the current settings.

       These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

       Note  that  not	all  X	implementations are guaranteed to honor all of
       these options.

       4mstring24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxsetroot24m  program  allows  you	 to  tailor  the  appearance of the
       background  ("root")  window  on	 a  workstation	 display  running   X.
       Normally,  you  experiment  with 4mxsetroot24m until you find a personalized
       look that you like, then put the 4mxsetroot24m command that produces it into
       your  X	startup	 file.	 If  no	 options  are specified, or if 4m-def24m is
       specified, the window is reset to its default state.  The  4m-def24m  option
       can  be	specified  along with other options and only the non-specified
       characteristics will be reset to the default state.

       Only one of  the	 background  color/tiling  changing  options  (-solid,
       -gray, -grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be specified at a time.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The various options are as follows:

       1m-help	22mPrint a usage message and exit.

       1m-def	22mReset  unspecified  attributes to the default values.  (Restores
	      the background to the familiar gray mesh and the cursor  to  the
	      hollow x shape.)

       1m-cursor 4m22mcursorfile24m 4mmaskfile0m
	      This  lets  you  change  the pointer cursor to whatever you want
	      when the pointer cursor is outside of any	 window.   Cursor  and
	      mask  files  are bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with
	      the 4mbitmap(1)24m program.  You probably want the mask  file  to	 be
	      all black until you get used to the way masks work.

       1m-cursor_name 4m22mcursorname0m
	      This  lets  you change the pointer cursor to one of the standard
	      cursors from the cursor font.  Refer to  appendix	 B  of	the  X
	      protocol for the names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided for
	      this option).

       1m-bitmap 4m22mfilename0m
	      Use the bitmap specified in the file to set the window  pattern.
	      You  can	make your own bitmap files (little pictures) using the
	      4mbitmap(1)24m program.  The entire background will  be  made  up	 of
	      repeated "tiles" of the bitmap.

       1m-mod 4m22mx24m 4my0m
	      This  is	used  if  you  want  a plaid-like grid pattern on your
	      screen.  x and y are integers ranging from 1  to	16.   Try  the
	      different	 combinations.	Zero and negative numbers are taken as
	      1.

       1m-gray	22mMake the entire background gray.  (Easier on the eyes.)

       1m-grey	22mMake the entire background grey.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor0m
	      Use  ``color''  as  the  foreground   color.    Foreground   and
	      background  colors  are  meaningful  only	 in  combination  with
	      -cursor, -bitmap, or -mod.

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor0m
	      Use ``color'' as the background color.

       1m-rv	22mThis exchanges the foreground and background	 colors.   Normally
	      the foreground color is black and the background color is white.

       1m-solid 4m22mcolor0m
	      This sets the background of the root  window  to	the  specified
	      color.  This option is only useful on color servers.

       1m-name 4m22mstring0m
	      Set  the	name  of  the  root window to ``string''.  There is no
	      default value.  Usually a name is assigned to a window  so  that
	      the window manager can use a text representation when the window
	      is iconified.  This option is unused since you can't iconify the
	      background.

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	      Specifies the server to connect to; see 4mX(7)24m.

XSM(1)									XSM(1)



1mNAME0m
       xsm - X Session Manager

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxsm 22m[-display display] [-session sessionName] [-verbose]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mxsm24m	 is  a session manager.	 A session is a group of applications, each
       of which has a particular state.	 4mxsm24m allows you  to  create  arbitrary
       sessions	  -   for  example,  you  might	 have  a  "light"  session,  a
       "development" session, or an "xterminal"	 session.   Each  session  can
       have  its own set of applications.  Within a session, you can perform a
       "checkpoint" to save application state, or a "shutdown" to  save	 state
       and exit the session.  When you log back in to the system, you can load
       a specific session, and you can delete sessions you no longer  want  to
       keep.

       Some  session  managers	simply allow you to manually specify a list of
       applications to be started in a session.	 4mxsm24m is more powerful  because
       it lets you run applications and have them automatically become part of
       the session.  On a simple level, 4mxsm24m is useful  because  it	 gives	you
       this ability to easily define which applications are in a session.  The
       true power of 4mxsm24m, however, can be taken advantage	of  when  more	and
       more applications learn to save and restore their state.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       Causes 4mxsm24m to connect to the specified X display.

       1m-session 4m22msessionName0m
	       Causes 4mxsm24m to load the specified session, bypassing the session
	       menu.

       1m-verbose0m
	       Turns on debugging information.

1mSETUP0m
   1m.xsession file0m
       Using 4mxsm24m requires a change to your 4m.xsession24m file:

       The last program executed by your 4m.xsession24m file should be	4mxsm24m.   With
       this  configuration,  when  the	user  chooses to shut down the session
       using 4mxsm24m, the session will truly be over.

       Since the goal of the  session  manager	is  to	restart	 clients  when
       logging	into  a	 session,  your .xsession file, in general, should not
       directly start up applications.	Rather,	 the  applications  should  be
       started	within	a  session.  When 4mxsm24m shuts down the session, 4mxsm24m will
       know to restart these applications.  Note however that there  are  some
       types  of applications that are not "session aware".  4mxsm24m allows you to
       manually add these applications to your session (see the section titled
       4mClient24m 4mList24m).


   1mSM_SAVE_DIR environment variable0m
       If  the	4mSM_SAVE_DIR24m environment variable is defined, 4mxsm24m will save all
       configuration files in this directory.  Otherwise, they will be	stored
       in  the	user's	home  directory.   Session aware applications are also
       encouraged to save their checkpoint files in the 4mSM_SAVE_DIR24m directory,
       although the user should not depend on this convention.


   1mDefault Startup Applications0m
       The  first  time	 4mxsm24m  is  started,	 it  will  need to locate a list of
       applications to start up.  For  example,	 this  list  might  include  a
       window  manager,	 a  session  management proxy, and an xterm.  4mxsm24m will
       first look for the file 4m.xsmstartup24m in the user's home  directory.	 If
       that file does not exist, it will look for the 4msystem.xsm24m file that was
       set up at installation time.  Note that	4mxsm24m  provides  a  "fail  safe"
       option  when  the  user	chooses	 a session to start up.	 The fail safe
       option simply loads the default applications described above.

       Each line in the startup file should contain  a	command	 to  start  an
       application.  A sample startup file might look this:

       <start of file>
       twm
       smproxy
       xterm
       <end of file>


1mSTARTING A SESSION0m
       When 4mxsm24m starts up, it first checks to see if the user previously saved
       any sessions.  If no saved sessions exist,  4mxsm24m  starts  up	 a  set	 of
       default	applications (as described above in the section titled 4mDefault0m
       4mStartup24m 4mApplications24m).	 If at least one session exists, a session  menu
       is  presented.	The 1m[-session sessionName] 22moption forces the specified
       session to be loaded, bypassing the session menu.

   1mThe session menu0m
       The session menu presents the user with a list of  sessions  to	choose
       from.   The  user  can  change  the currently selected session with the
       mouse, or by using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.   Note  that
       sessions which are locked (i.e. running on a different display) can not
       be loaded or deleted.

       The following operations can be performed from the session menu:


       1mLoad Session	       22mPressing this	 button	 will  load  the  currently
			     selected  session.	  Alternatively,  hitting  the
			     Return key will also load the currently  selected
			     session,  or  the user can double click a session
			     from the list.

       1mDelete Session	       22mThis operation will delete the currently selected
			     session,	along  with  all  of  the  application
			     checkpoint files  associated  with	 the  session.
			     After  pressing  this  button,  the  user will be
			     asked to press the button a second time in	 order
			     to confirm the operation.

       1mDefault/Fail Safe     4m22mxsm24m  will  start up a set of default applications
			     (as described above in the section titled 4mDefault0m
			     4mStartup24m  4mApplications24m).	 This is useful when the
			     user wants to start a fresh session,  or  if  the
			     session  configuration  files  were corrupted and
			     the user wants a "fail safe" session.

       1mCancel		       22mPressing this button will cause 4mxsm24m to exit.   It
			     can  also	be  used  to cancel a "Delete Session"
			     operation.


1mCONTROLLING A SESSION0m
       After 4mxsm24m determines which session to  load,  it  brings  up  its  main
       window,	then  starts up all applications that are part of the session.
       The title bar for the session manager's main window  will  contain  the
       name of the session that was loaded.

       The following options are available from 4mxsm24m's main window:

       1mClient List	   22mPressing	this button brings up a window containing a
			 list of all clients that are in the current  session.
			 For  each client, the host machine that the client is
			 running on is presented.  As clients  are  added  and
			 removed  from	the  session,  this list is updated to
			 reflect the changes.  The user is able to control how
			 these clients are restarted (see below).

			 By  pressing the 1mView Properties 22mbutton, the user can
			 view the  session  management	properties  associated
			 with the currently selected client.

			 By  pressing  the  1mClone 22mbutton, the user can start a
			 copy of the selected application.

			 By pressing the 1mKill	 Client	 22mbutton,  the  user	can
			 remove a client from the session.

			 By  selecting	a  restart  hint from the 1mRestart Hint0m
			 menu, the  user  can  control	the  restarting	 of  a
			 client.  The following hints are available:

			 1m-  22mThe  1mRestart	 If  Running  22mhint indicates that the
			 client should be restarted in the next session if  it
			 is connected to the session manager at the end of the
			 current session.

			 1m- 22mThe 1mRestart Anyway 22mhint indicates that  the  client
			 should	 be  restarted	in the next session even if it
			 exits before the current session is terminated.

			 1m- 22mThe 1mRestart Immediately  22mhint  is	similar	 to  the
			 1mRestart  Anyway  22mhint, but in addition, the client is
			 meant to run continuously.  If the client exits,  the
			 session manager will try to restart it in the current
			 session.

			 1m- 22mThe 1mRestart Never 22mhint indicates  that  the  client
			 should not be restarted in the next session.

			 Note  that  all  X  applications  may not be "session
			 aware".  Applications that are not session aware  are
			 ones  that  do	 not  support the X Session Management
			 Protocol or they can not be detected by  the  Session
			 Management  Proxy (see the section titled 4mTHE24m 4mPROXY24m).
			 4mxsm24m allows the user to manually add such applications
			 to the session.  The bottom of the 4mClient24m 4mList24m window
			 contains a text  entry	 field	in  which  application
			 commands  can be typed in.  Each command should go on
			 its own line.	This information will  be  saved  with
			 the session at checkpoint or shutdown time.  When the
			 session  is  restarted,  4mxsm24m   will   restart   these
			 applications  in  addition  to	 the  regular "session
			 aware" applications.

			 Pressing the 1mDone  22mbutton	 removes  the  1mClient	 List0m
			 window.

       1mSession Log...	   22mThe  Session  Log	 window presents useful information
			 about the session.  For example, when	a  session  is
			 restarted,  all  of  the  restart  commands  will  be
			 displayed in the log window.

       1mCheckpoint	   22mBy performing a checkpoint, all applications that are
			 in  the  session  are asked to save their state.  Not
			 every application will save its complete  state,  but
			 at  a minimum, the session manager is guaranteed that
			 it will receive the command required to  restart  the
			 application (along with all command line options).  A
			 window manager participating in  the  session	should
			 guarantee  that  the  applications  will come back up
			 with the same window configurations.

			 If the session being checkpointed was never  assigned
			 a  name,  the	user  will  be	required  to specify a
			 session name.	Otherwise, the user  can  perform  the
			 checkpoint  using  the current session name, or a new
			 session name can be specified.	 If the	 session  name
			 specified  already exists, the user will be given the
			 opportunity  to  specify  a  different	 name  or   to
			 overwrite  the already existing session.  Note that a
			 session which is locked can not be overwritten.

			 When performing a checkpoint, the user must specify a
			 1mSave	 Type  22mwhich	 informs  the  applications  in the
			 session how much state they should save.

			 The 1mLocal 22mtype indicates that the application  should
			 save  enough information to restore the state as seen
			 by the user.  It should not affect the state as  seen
			 by  other users.  For example, an editor would create
			 a temporary  file  containing	the  contents  of  its
			 editing buffer, the location of the cursor, etc...

			 The 1mGlobal 22mtype indicates that the application should
			 commit	 all  of  its  data  to	 permanent,   globally
			 accessible  storage.	For  example, the editor would
			 simply save the edited file.

			 The 1mBoth 22mtype indicates that the	application  should
			 do both of these.  For example, the editor would save
			 the edited file, then create a	 temporary  file  with
			 information  such  as	the  location  of  the cursor,
			 etc...

			 In addition to the 1mSave Type22m, the user  must  specify
			 an 1mInteract Style22m.

			 The  1mNone  22mtype indicates that the application should
			 not interact with the user while saving state.

			 The 1mErrors 22mtype indicates that  the  application	may
			 interact  with	 the  user  only if an error condition
			 arises.

			 The 1mAny  22mtype  indicates	that  the  application	may
			 interact  with	 the  user for any purpose.  Note that
			 4mxsm24m will only allow one application to interact  with
			 the user at a time.


			 After	the  checkpoint	 is  completed,	 4mxsm24m  will, if
			 necessary, display a window containing	 the  list  of
			 applications  which  did not report a successful save
			 of state.

       1mShutdown	   22mA shutdown provides all of the  options  found  in  a
			 checkpoint, but in addition, can cause the session to
			 exit.	Note that if the interaction style  is	1mErrors0m
			 or  1mAny22m,	the user may cancel the shutdown.  The user
			 may  also  cancel  the	 shutdown  if	any   of   the
			 applications report an unsuccessful save of state.

			 The  user may choose to shutdown the session with our
			 without performing a checkpoint.


1mHOW 4m22mXSM24m 1mRESPONDS TO SIGNALS0m
       4mxsm24m will respond to a SIGTERM signal by performing a shutdown with	the
       following  options: fast, no interaction, save type local.  This allows
       the user's session to be saved when the system is being	shutdown.   It
       can also be used to perform a remote shutdown of a session.

       4mxsm24m	 will  respond	to a SIGUSR1 signal by performing a checkpoint with
       the following options: no interaction, save type	 local.	  This	signal
       can be used to perform a remote checkpoint of a session.


1mTHE PROXY0m
       Since  not  all	applications have been ported to support the X Session
       Management Protocol, a proxy service exists to allow "old"  clients  to
       work  with  the	session	 manager.  In order for the proxy to detect an
       application joining a session, one of the following must be true:

       -  The  application  maps   a   top   level   window   containing   the
       1mWM_CLIENT_LEADER  22mproperty.	  This	property  provides a pointer to the
       client leader window which contains the 1mWM_CLASS22m, 1mWM_NAME22m,  1mWM_COMMAND22m,
       and 1mWM_CLIENT_MACHINE 22mproperties.

       or ...

       -  The  application  maps a top level window which does not contain the
       1mWM_CLIENT_LEADER 22mproperty.	However, this top level window contains the
       1mWM_CLASS22m, 1mWM_NAME22m, 1mWM_COMMAND22m, and 1mWM_CLIENT_MACHINE 22mproperties.

       An  application that support the 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mprotocol will receive
       a 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mclient message each time the session manager  issues
       a  checkpoint  or shutdown.  This allows the application to save state.
       If an application does not support the 1mWM_SAVE_YOURSELF 22mprotocol,  then
       the  proxy  will	 provide  enough information to the session manager to
       restart the application	(using	1mWM_COMMAND22m),  but	no  state  will	 be
       restored.


1mREMOTE APPLICATIONS0m
       4mxsm24m	  requires   a	remote	execution  protocol  in	 order	to  restart
       applications on remote machines.	 Currently, 4mxsm24m  supports	the  4mrstart0m
       protocol.   In  order  to  restart  an application on remote machine 1mX22m,
       machine 1mX 22mmust have 4mrstart24m installed.	In the future, additional remote
       execution protocols may be supported.

1mNAME0m
       xstdcmap - X standard colormap utility

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxstdcmap  22m[-all]  [-best]  [-blue]	[-default]  [-delete 4mmap24m] [-display
       4mdisplay24m] [-gray] [-green] [-help] [-red] [-verbose]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 4mxstdcmap24m  utility  can	be  used  to  selectively  define  standard
       colormap	 properties.  It is intended to be run from a user's X startup
       script to create standard colormap definitions in order	to  facilitate
       sharing	of  scarce  colormap  resources	 among	clients.  Where at all
       possible, colormaps are created with read-only allocations.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The following options may be used with 4mxstdcmap24m:

       1m-all	 22mThis option indicates that all six standard colormap properties
	       should  be  defined  on	each  screen  of the display.  Not all
	       screens will support  visuals  under  which  all	 six  standard
	       colormap	 properties  are  meaningful.  4mxstdcmap24m will determine
	       the best allocations and visuals for the colormap properties of
	       a  screen. Any previously existing standard colormap properties
	       will be replaced.

       1m-best	 22mThis option indicates that the RGB_BEST_MAP should be  defined.

       1m-blue	 22mThis  option indicates that the RGB_BLUE_MAP should be defined.

       1m-default0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  the  RGB_DEFAULT_MAP  should  be
	       defined.

       1m-delete 4m22mmap0m
	       This   option  specifies	 that  a  specific  standard  colormap
	       property, or all such properties, should be removed.   4mmap24m	may
	       be one of: default, best, red, green, blue, gray, or all.

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the host and display to use; see 4mX(7)24m.

       1m-gray	 22mThis  option indicates that the RGB_GRAY_MAP should be defined.

       1m-green	 22mThis option indicates that the RGB_GREEN_MAP should be defined.

       1m-help	 22mThis  option  indicates that a brief description of the command
	       line arguments should be printed on the standard	 error.	  This
	       will  be	 done  whenever	 an  unhandled	argument  is  given to
	       4mxstdcmap.0m

       1m-red	 22mThis option indicates that the RGB_RED_MAP should be defined.

       1m-verbose0m
	       This  option  indicates	that  4mxstdcmap24m  should  print  logging
	       information  as	it  parses  its input and defines the standard
	       colormap properties.

XSUN(1)								       XSUN(1)



1mNAME0m
       Xsun, XsunMono, Xsun24 - Sun server for X Version 11

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXsun 22m[ option ] ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXsun24m is the server for Version  11	of  the	 X  window  system  on	Sun
       hardware.   It  will  normally  be started by the 4mxdm(1)24m daemon or by a
       script that runs the program 4mxinit(1)24m.

1mCONFIGURATIONS0m
       4mXsunMono24m supports the BW2 monochrome frame buffer.	4mXsun24m  supports  the
       CG2, CG3, CG4, and CG6 8-bit color frame buffers in addition to the BW2
       monochrome frame buffer. On Solaris 2.5 it also supports the TCX as  an
       8-bit  color  frame  buffer.   4mXsun2424m supports the cgeight 24-bit color
       frame buffer in addition	 to  the  8-bit	 color	and  monochrome	 frame
       buffers that 4mXsun24m supports.

       If  specific  framebuffer  device files aren't specified on the command
       line with the 4m-dev24m switch or in the 4mXDEVICE24m environment  variable,  the
       server  will  search  for  all installed frame buffers and will use all
       those that it finds.

       Finally, if no specific framebuffers are found, the generic framebuffer
       interface 4m/dev/fb24m is used.


1mKEYBOARDS0m
       Xsun,  Xsun24,  and  XsunMono  support  the  Type-2,  Type-3,  and many
       variations of the Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards.

       Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards feature a key labeled 4mAltGraph24m which  is  a
       mode-shift  key.	 The  mode-shift  key  is used to generate the symbols
       painted on the fronts of the keys. The  mode-shift  key	works  exactly
       like the 4mShift24m, 4mControl24m, 4mAlt24m, and 4m<Meta>24m keys.

       The  ten	 function  keys on the left side of the Type-5 keyboard may be
       considered as having L1..L10 painted on their  fronts.	Shift-AltGraph
       will  cause  different  keysyms to be generated for some keys, e.g. the
       Type-5 4mSysRq24m key.

       For compatibility with Sun's X11/NeWS server, the F11 and F12 keys  may
       be  made	 to  generate  the  equivalent X11/NeWS keysyms by using mode-
       switch.

       For backwards compatibility, the normal and  mode-shifted  keysyms  for
       the  ten	 function keys on the left side of Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards
       may be swapped via command line option. See 4m-swapLkeys24m.

       The X LEDs 1..4 correspond to the  NumLock,  ScrollLock,	 Compose,  and
       CapsLock	  LEDs	 respectively.	 Pressing   the	 key  once  turns  the
       corresponding LED on. Pressing the key again turns the LED off. Turning
       an  LED	on  or	off  with  e.g.	 'xset [-]led [1234]' is equivalent to
       pressing the corresponding key.

1mOPTIONS0m
       In addition to the normal server options described  in  the  4mXserver(1)0m
       manual page, 4mXsun24m accepts the following command line switches:

       1m-ar1 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       This  option  specifies	amount	of time in milliseconds before
	       which a pressed key should begin to autorepeat.

       1m-ar2 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       This option specifies  the  interval  in	 milliseconds  between
	       autorepeats of pressed keys.

       1m-swapLkeys0m
	       Swaps the normal keysyms for the function keys on the left side
	       of Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards with the alternate keysyms, i.e.
	       the keysyms painted on the front of the keys.

       1m-flipPixels0m
	       The  normal  pixel  values  for	white  and  black  are 0 and 1
	       respectively.  When -flipPixels is specified these  values  are
	       reversed.

       1m-mono	 22mWhen used with the 1mcgtwo22m, this option indicates that the server
	       should emulate a monochrome framebuffer instead of  the	normal
	       color  framebuffer.   When  used	 with  the 1mcgfour22m, this option
	       indicates that the monochrome screen should be numbered	0  and
	       the  color screen numbered 1 (instead of the other way around).

       1m-zaphod 22mThis option disables switching between screens by  sliding	the
	       mouse  off  the	left  or  right	 edges.	 With this disabled, a
	       window manager function must be used to switch between screens.

       1m-debug	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the	server	is being run from a
	       debugger, and that it should 1mnot 22mput its standard input, output
	       and error files into non-blocking mode.

       1m-dev 4m22mfilename[:filename]...0m
	       This   option  specifies	 the  colon  separated	names  of  the
	       framebuffer device files to be used.

       1m-fbinfo 22mThis option indicates that	the  server  should  enumerate	the
	       available frame buffers that it will use.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       1mXDEVICE 22mIf	present,   and	if  no	explicit  1m-dev  22moptions  are given,
	       specifies the (colon separated) list of display devices to use.

1mSEE ALSO0m
       X(7), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xinit(1)

1mBUGS0m
       The auto-configuration depends on there being appropriate special files
       in the 4m/dev24m directory for the framebuffers which are to be used.  Extra
       entries	can  confuse the server.  For example,	the X/160C in fact has
       the hardware for a monochrome 1mbwtwo0 22mon the CPU board.  So if 4m/dev24m  has
       a  special  file	 for 4m/dev/bwtwo024m, the server will use it,	even though
       there is no monitor attached to the monochrome framebuffer.  The server
       will  appear  to start,	but not to paint a cursor,  because the cursor
       is on the monochrome frame buffer. The solution is to remove  the  4m/dev0m
       entries for any device you don't have a monitor for.

       There  is a bug in pre-FCS operating systems for the Sun-4 which causes
       the server to crash driving a 1mcgtwo22m.

XTERM(1)							      XTERM(1)



1mNAME0m
       xterm - terminal emulator for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxterm 22m[-4mtoolkitoption24m ...] [-4moption24m ...] [4mshell24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  4mxterm24m	program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.	 It
       provides	 DEC  VT102/VT220  (VTxxx)  and	 Tektronix   4014   compatible
       terminals  for programs that cannot use the window system directly.  If
       the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing capabilities
       (for  example,  the  SIGWINCH  signal  in systems derived from 4.3bsd),
       4mxterm24m will use the facilities to notify programs running in the  window
       whenever it is resized.

       The  VTxxx  and	Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so
       that you can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at  the
       same  time.   To	 maintain  the	correct	 aspect	 ratio (height/width),
       Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a	4014's
       aspect  ratio  that will fit in the window.  This box is located in the
       upper left area of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
       considered  the	``active''  window  for	 receiving  keyboard input and
       terminal output.	 This is the window that  contains  the	 text  cursor.
       The  active  window  can	 be  chosen through escape sequences, the ``VT
       Options'' menu in the VTxxx window, and the ``Tek Options'' menu in the
       4014 window.

1mEMULATIONS0m
       The   VT102   emulation	is  fairly  complete,  but  does  not  support
       autorepeat.  Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font
       server  supports	 scalable fonts.  The VT220 emulation does not support
       soft fonts, it is otherwise complete.   4mTermcap24m(5)	entries	 that  work
       with  4mxterm24m	 include  an  optional	platform-specific entry, ``xterm,''
       ``vt102,'' ``vt100'' and ``ansi,'' and ``dumb.''	  4mxterm24m  automatically
       searches the termcap file in this order for these entries and then sets
       the ``TERM'' and the ``TERMCAP'' environment variables.	You  may  also
       use  ``vt220,''	 but  must  set	 the terminal emulation level with the
       1mdecTerminalID 22mresource.  (The ``TERMCAP'' environment variable  is	not
       set  if 4mxterm24m is linked against a terminfo library, since the requisite
       information is not  provided  by	 the  termcap  emulation  of  terminfo
       libraries).

       Many  of	 the  special  4mxterm24m  features  may  be modified under program
       control through a set of escape sequences different from	 the  standard
       VT102 escape sequences.	(See the 4mXterm24m 4mControl24m 4mSequences24m document.)

       The  Tektronix  4014 emulation is also fairly good.  It supports 12-bit
       graphics addressing, scaled to the window size.	 Four  different  font
       sizes and five different lines types are supported.  There is no write-
       through or defocused mode support.  The	Tektronix  text	 and  graphics
       commands	 are recorded internally by 4mxterm24m and may be written to a file
       by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the 1mTektronix 22mmenu; see
       below).	 The  name  of	the  file will be ``1mCOPY4m22myyyy24m1m-4m22mMM24m1m-4m22mdd24m1m.4m22mhh24m1m:4m22mmm24m1m:4m22mss24m'',
       where 4myyyy24m, 4mMM24m, 4mdd24m, 4mhh24m, 4mmm24m and 4mss24m	are  the  year,	 month,	 day,  hour,
       minute  and  second when the COPY was performed (the file is created in
       the directory 4mxterm24m is started in, or the home directory  for  a  login
       4mxterm24m).

       Not  all	 of  the  features  described  in  this manual are necessarily
       available  in  this  version  of	 4mxterm24m.   Some  (e.g.,  the  non-VT220
       extensions)  are	 available  only  if they were compiled in, though the
       most commonly-used are in the default configuration.

1mOTHER FEATURES0m
       4mXterm24m automatically highlights the text cursor when the pointer  enters
       the  window  (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the
       window (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then the  text
       cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.

       In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an
       alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area  of
       the  window.   When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced
       with the alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the
       window is disabled until the normal screen is restored.	The 4mtermcap24m(5)
       entry for 4mxterm24m allows  the	 visual	 editor	 4mvi24m(1)  to	 switch	 to  the
       alternate  screen  for  editing	and  to restore the screen on exit.  A
       popup menu entry makes it simple	 to  switch  between  the  normal  and
       alternate screens for cut and paste.

       In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change
       the name of the windows.	 Additionally, in VT102 mode, 4mxterm24m implements
       the window-manipulation control sequences from 4mdtterm24m, such as resizing
       the window, setting its location on the screen.

       4mXterm24m allows  character-based  applications	 to  receive  mouse  events
       (currently  button-press	 and release events, and button-motion events)
       as  keyboard  control  sequences.   See	4mXterm24m  4mControl24m  4mSequences24m  for
       details.

1mOPTIONS0m
       The 4mxterm24m terminal emulator accepts the standard X Toolkit command line
       options as well as many application-specific options.   If  the	option
       begins  with  a	`1m+22m'  instead  of  a `1m-22m', the option is restored to its
       default value.  The 1m-version 22mand 1m-help 22moptions are interpreted even  if
       4mxterm24m  cannot  open	 the  display,	and  are  useful  for  testing	and
       configuration scripts:

       1m-version0m
	       This causes 4mxterm24m to print a version  number  to  the  standard
	       output.

       1m-help	 22mThis causes 4mxterm24m to print out a verbose message describing its
	       options, one per line.  The message is written to the  standard
	       output.	 4mXterm24m  generates	this message, sorting it and noting
	       whether a "1m-option22m" or a "1m+option22m" turns the feature on or off,
	       since  some  features  historically have been one or the other.
	       4mXterm24m generates a concise help message  (multiple  options	per
	       line) when an unknown option is used, e.g.,
		    1mxterm -z0m

	       If  the	logic  for  a particular option such as logging is not
	       compiled into 4mxterm24m, the help text for that option also is	not
	       displayed by the 1m-help 22moption.

       One parameter (after all options) may be given.	That overrides 4mxterm24m's
       built-in choice of shell program.   Normally  4mxterm24m	 checks	 the  SHELL
       variable.   If  that  is	 not set, 4mxterm24m tries to use the shell program
       specified in the password  file.	  If  that  is	not  set,  4mxterm24m  uses
       4m/bin/sh24m.   If  the	parameter names an executable file, 4mxterm24m uses that
       instead.	 The parameter must be an absolute path, or name a file	 found
       on  the	user's	PATH (and thereby construct an absolute path).	The 1m-e0m
       option cannot be used with this parameter since it uses all  parameters
       following the option.

       The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.  Not
       all options are necessarily configured into your copy of 4mxterm24m:

       1m-132	 22mNormally, the  VT102  DECCOLM  escape  sequence  that  switches
	       between	80 and 132 column mode is ignored.  This option causes
	       the DECCOLM escape sequence to be  recognized,  and  the	 4mxterm0m
	       window will resize appropriately.

       1m-ah	 22mThis  option  indicates  that 4mxterm24m should always highlight the
	       text cursor.  By default, 4mxterm24m  will  display  a  hollow  text
	       cursor  whenever	 the  focus  is lost or the pointer leaves the
	       window.

       1m+ah	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m  should  do  text	  cursor
	       highlighting based on focus.

       1m-ai	 22mThis  option  disables  active icon support if that feature was
	       compiled into 4mxterm24m.  This is equivalent to setting	 the  4mvt1000m
	       resource 1mactiveIcon 22mto ``false''.

       1m+ai	 22mThis  option  enables  active  icon support if that feature was
	       compiled into 4mxterm24m.  This is equivalent to setting	 the  4mvt1000m
	       resource 1mactiveIcon 22mto ``true''.

       1m-aw	 22mThis  option  indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed.
	       This allows the cursor to automatically wrap to	the  beginning
	       of the next line when when it is at the rightmost position of a
	       line and text is output.

       1m+aw	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  auto-wraparound  should  not	 be
	       allowed.

       1m-b 4m22mnumber0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  size  of  the  inner  border (the
	       distance between the outer  edge	 of  the  characters  and  the
	       window  border)	in  pixels.   That is the 4mvt10024m 4minternalBorder0m
	       resource.  The default is 2.

       1m+bc	 22mturn off text cursor blinking.  This overrides the	1mcursorBlink0m
	       resource.

       1m-bc	 22mturn  on  text cursor blinking.  This overrides the 1mcursorBlink0m
	       resource.

       1m-bcf 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the
	       4mcursorOffTime24m resource.

       1m-bcn 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       set  the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
	       4mcursorOffTime24m resource.

       1m-bdc	 22mSet the 4mvt10024m resource 1mcolorBDMode 22mto ``false'', disabling  the
	       display of characters with bold attribute as color

       1m+bdc	 22mSet	 the  4mvt10024m  resource 1mcolorBDMode 22mto ``true'', enabling the
	       display of characters with bold attribute as color rather  than
	       bold

       1m-cb	 22mSet the 4mvt10024m resource 1mcutToBeginningOfLine 22mto ``false''.

       1m+cb	 22mSet the 4mvt10024m resource 1mcutToBeginningOfLine 22mto ``true''.

       1m-cc 4m22mcharacterclassrange24m1m:4m22mvalue24m1m[,...]0m
	       This  sets  classes  indicated by the given ranges for using in
	       selecting by  words.   See  the	section	 specifying  character
	       classes.	 and discussion of the 4mcharClass24m resource.

       1m-cjk_width0m
	       Set  the	 1mcjkWidth  22mresource  to  ``true''.	  When	turned	on,
	       characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A)	 category  in  UTR  11
	       have  a column width of 2.  Otherwise, they have a column width
	       of 1.  This may be useful for some legacy  CJK  text  terminal-
	       based  programs	assuming  box  drawings	 and  others to have a
	       column width of 2.  It also  has	 to  be	 turned	 on  when  you
	       specify	a  TrueType CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font
	       either with 1m-fa 22mat the command line or 1mfaceName 22mresource.   The
	       default is ``false''

       1m+cjk_width0m
	       Reset the 1mcjkWidth 22mresource.

       1m-class 4m22mstring0m
	       This  option  allows  you  to  override 4mxterm24m's resource class.
	       Normally it is ``XTerm'', but can be set to another class  such
	       as ``UXTerm'' to override selected resources.

       1m-cm	 22mThis  option  disables  recognition of ANSI color-change escape
	       sequences.  It sets the 4mcolorMode24m resource to ``false''.

       1m+cm	 22mThis option enables recognition  of	 ANSI  color-change  escape
	       sequences.  This is the same as the 4mvt10024m resource 1mcolorMode22m.

       1m-cn	 22mThis  option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-
	       mode selections.	 It sets the 4mcutNewline24m resource to ``false''.

       1m+cn	 22mThis  option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode
	       selections.  It sets the 4mcutNewline24m resource to ``true''.

       1m-cr 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color to use for  text	 cursor.   The
	       default	is  to	use the same foreground color that is used for
	       text.  It  sets	the  4mcursorColor24m  resource	 according  to	the
	       parameter.

       1m-cu	 22mThis  option  indicates  that 4mxterm24m should work around a bug in
	       the 4mmore24m(1) program that causes it to incorrectly display lines
	       that  are exactly the width of the window and are followed by a
	       line beginning with a tab (the leading tabs are not displayed).
	       This option is so named because it was originally thought to be
	       a bug in the 4mcurses24m(3x) cursor motion package.

       1m+cu	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should  not  work  around  the
	       4mmore24m(1) bug mentioned above.

       1m-dc	 22mThis  option  disables  the	 escape	 sequence to change dynamic
	       colors: the vt100 foreground and background  colors,  its  text
	       cursor  color,  the  pointer  cursor  foreground and background
	       colors,	the  Tektronix	emulator  foreground  and   background
	       colors,	its text cursor color and highlight color.  The option
	       sets the 4mdynamicColors24m option to ``false''.

       1m+dc	 22mThis option enables	 the  escape  sequence	to  change  dynamic
	       colors.	 The option sets the 4mdynamicColors24m option to ``true''.

       1m-e 4m22mprogram24m 1m[ 4m22marguments24m 1m... ]0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  program  (and  its	 command  line
	       arguments)  to  be  run	in the 4mxterm24m window.  It also sets the
	       window title and icon name to be the basename  of  the  program
	       being  executed	if  neither 4m-T24m nor 4m-n24m are given on the command
	       line.  1mThis must be the last option on the command line.0m

       1m-en 4m22mencoding0m
	       This option determines the encoding on which  4mxterm24m	 runs.	 It
	       sets  the  1mlocale  22mresource.   Encodings  other  than UTF-8 are
	       supported by using 4mluit24m.  The 1m-lc 22moption should be used instead
	       of 1m-en 22mfor systems with locale support.

       1m-fb 4m22mfont0m
	       This  option  specifies	a font to be used when displaying bold
	       text.  This font must be the  same  height  and	width  as  the
	       normal  font.   If  only	 one  of  the  normal or bold fonts is
	       specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold font
	       will  be produced by overstriking this font.  The default is to
	       do overstriking of the normal font.  See also the discussion of
	       1mboldFont 22mand 1mboldMode 22mresources.

       1m-fa 4m22mpattern0m
	       This  option  sets  the	pattern	 for  fonts  selected from the
	       FreeType library if support for that library was compiled  into
	       4mxterm24m.   This corresponds to the 1mfaceName 22mresource.  When a CJK
	       double-width font is specified, you also need to	 turn  on  the
	       1mcjkWidth 22mresource.

       1m-fbb	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should compare normal and bold
	       fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are	compatible.   It  sets
	       the 1mfreeBoldBox 22mresource to ``false''.

       1m+fbb	 22mThis  option indicates that 4mxterm24m should not compare normal and
	       bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they	 are  compatible.   It
	       sets the 1mfreeBoldBox 22mresource to ``true''.

       1m-fbx	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m should not assume that the
	       normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing  characters.   If
	       any  are	 missing, 4mxterm24m will draw the characters directly.	 It
	       sets the 1mforceBoxChars 22mresource to ``false''.

       1m+fbx	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should assume that the  normal
	       and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.  It sets the
	       1mforceBoxChars 22mresource to ``true''.

       1m-fd 4m22mpattern0m
	       This option sets the pattern for	 double-width  fonts  selected
	       from  the  FreeType  library  if	 support  for that library was
	       compiled	   into	   4mxterm24m.	   This	   corresponds	  to	the
	       1mfaceNameDoublesize 22mresource.

       1m-fi 4m22mfont0m
	       This  option sets the font for active icons if that feature was
	       compiled into 4mxterm24m.  See also the discussion of  the  1miconFont0m
	       resource.

       1m-fs 4m22msize0m
	       This  option  sets  the	pointsize  for fonts selected from the
	       FreeType library if support for that library was compiled  into
	       4mxterm24m.  This corresponds to the 1mfaceSize 22mresource.

       1m-fw 4m22mfont0m
	       This  option  specifies the font to be used for displaying wide
	       text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as  wide
	       as  the	font  that  will  be  used to draw normal text.	 If no
	       doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the
	       normal font.  This corresponds to the 1mwideFont 22mresource.

       1m-fwb 4m22mfont0m
	       This  option  specifies the font to be used for displaying bold
	       wide text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice  as
	       wide  as	 the  font that will be used to draw bold text.	 If no
	       doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the
	       bold font.  This corresponds to the 1mwideBoldFont 22mresource.

       1m-fx 4m22mfont0m
	       This  option  specifies	the font to be used for displaying the
	       preedit string in the "OverTheSpot" input method.  See also the
	       discussion of the 1mximFont 22mresource.

       1m-hc 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the background of
	       selected or otherwise  highlighted  text.   If  not  specified,
	       reverse	 video	 is   used.    See   the   discussion  of  the
	       1mhighlightColor 22mresource.

       1m-hf	 22mThis option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes  should
	       be  generated  for  function  keys.  It sets the 1mhpFunctionKeys0m
	       resource to ``true''.

       1m+hf	 22mThis option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes  should
	       not be generated for function keys.  It sets the 1mhpFunctionKeys0m
	       resource to ``false''.

       1m-hold	 22mTurn on the 1mhold 22mresource, i.e.,  4mxterm24m  will  not  immediately
	       destroy	its  window when the shell command completes.  It will
	       wait until you use  the	window	manager	 to  destroy/kill  the
	       window,	or  if	you  use  the menu entries that send a signal,
	       e.g., HUP or KILL.

       1m+hold	 22mTurn off  the  1mhold  22mresource,	 i.e.,	4mxterm24m  will  immediately
	       destroy its window when the shell command completes.

       1m-ie	 22mTurn  on  the  1mptyInitialErase  22mresource, i.e., use the pseudo-
	       terminal's sense of the stty erase value.

       1m+ie	 22mTurn off the 1mptyInitialErase 22mresource, i.e., set the stty erase
	       value  using  the  1mkb	22mstring  from	 the  termcap  entry  as  a
	       reference, if available.

       1m-im	 22mTurn on the 1museInsertMode 22mresource, which forces use of  insert
	       mode  by	 adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP environment
	       variable.

       1m+im	 22mTurn off the 1museInsertMode 22mresource.

       1m-into 4m22mwindowId0m
	       Given an X window identifier (a decimal	integer),  4mxterm24m  will
	       reparent	 its  top-level	 shell widget to that window.  This is
	       used to embed 4mxterm24m within other applications.

       1m-j	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should do jump scrolling.   It
	       corresponds  to	the  1mjumpScroll  22mresource.	  Normally, text is
	       scrolled one line at a time; this option allows 4mxterm24m  to  move
	       multiple	 lines	at  a  time  so	 that  it does not fall as far
	       behind.	Its use is strongly recommended since it  makes	 4mxterm0m
	       much  faster  when scanning through large amounts of text.  The
	       VT100 escape sequences for enabling and disabling smooth scroll
	       as  well	 as  the  ``VT Options'' menu can be used to turn this
	       feature on or off.

       1m+j	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should not do jump  scrolling.

       1m-k8	 22mThis   option   sets   the	 1mallowC1Printable  22mresource.   When
	       1mallowC1Printable 22mis set, 4mxterm24m	 overrides  the	 mapping  of  C1
	       control characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable.

       1m+k8	 22mThis option resets the 1mallowC1Printable 22mresource.

       1m-kt 4m22mkeyboardtype0m
	       This  option  sets  the 1mkeyboardType 22mresource.  Possible values
	       include: ``unknown'', ``default'', ``hp'', ``sco'', ``sun'' and
	       ``vt220''.

	       The  value ``unknown'', causes the corresponding resource to be
	       ignored.

	       The value  ``default'',	suppresses  the	 associated  resources
	       1mhpFunctionKeys22m,	1mscoFunctionKeys22m,	  1msunFunctionKeys    22mand
	       1msunKeyboard22m, using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.

       1m-l	 22mTurn logging on.  Normally logging is  not	supported,  due	 to
	       security	 concerns.   Some  versions  of 4mxterm24m may have logging
	       enabled.	 The logfile is written to the	directory  from	 which
	       4mxterm24m is invoked.  The filename is generated, of the form

		    XtermLog.4mXXXXXX0m

	       or

		    Xterm.log.4mhostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX0m

	       depending on how 4mxterm24m was built.

       1m+l	 22mTurn logging off.

       1m-lc	 22mTurn  on  support  of various encodings according to the users'
	       locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL,  LC_CTYPE,	 or  LANG  environment
	       variables.   This  is  achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by
	       invoking 4mluit24m  for	conversion  between  locale  encodings	and
	       UTF-8.	 (4mluit24m   is  not  invoked	in  UTF-8  locales.)   This
	       corresponds to the 1mlocale 22mresource.

	       The actual list of encodings which are supported is  determined
	       by  4mluit24m.	Consult	 the  4mluit24m manual page for further details.
	       See also the discussion of the 1m-u8 22moption which supports  UTF-8
	       locales.

       1m+lc	 22mTurn  off  support	of automatic selection of locale encodings.
	       Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with 1m-u8 22moption,
	       UTF-8 mode will be used.

       1m-lcc 4m22mpath0m
	       File  name  for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings
	       and UTF-8 which is used with 1m-lc  22moption  or  1mlocale  22mresource.
	       This corresponds to the 1mlocaleFilter 22mresource.

       1m-leftbar0m
	       Force  scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen.  This is the
	       default, unless you have set the rightScrollBar resource.

       1m-lf 4m22mfilename0m
	       Specify the log-filename.  See the 1m-l 22moption.

       1m-ls	 22mThis option indicates that the shell that  is  started  in	the
	       4mxterm24m  window  will be a login shell (i.e., the first character
	       of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating  to  the  shell  that  it
	       should read the user's .login or .profile).

	       The  1m-ls  22mflag and the 1mloginShell 22mresource are ignored if 1m-e 22mis
	       also given, because 4mxterm24m does not know how to make	 the  shell
	       start  the  given  command  after whatever it does when it is a
	       login shell - the user's shell of choice need not be  a	Bourne
	       shell  after  all.   Also,  4mxterm24m 4m-e24m  is  supposed to provide a
	       consistent functionality for other applications	that  need  to
	       start  text-mode	 programs  in a window, and if 1mloginShell 22mwere
	       not ignored, the result	of  ~/.profile	might  interfere  with
	       that.

	       If you do want the effect of 1m-ls 22mand 1m-e 22msimultaneously, you may
	       get away with something like
		      xterm -e /bin/bash -l -c "my command here"

	       Finally, 1m-ls 22mis not completely  ignored,  because  4mxterm24m 4m-ls24m 4m-e0m
	       does  write a 4m/etc/wtmp24m entry (if configured to do so), whereas
	       4mxterm24m 4m-e24m does not.

       1m+ls	 22mThis option indicates that the shell that is started should not
	       be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal ``subshell'').

       1m-mb	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should ring a margin bell when
	       the user types near the right end of a line.  This  option  can
	       be turned on and off from the ``VT Options'' menu.

       1m+mb	 22mThis option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.

       1m-mc 4m22mmilliseconds0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  maximum  time between multi-click
	       selections.

       1m-mesg	 22mTurn off the 1mmessages 22mresource, i.e., disallow write access  to
	       the terminal.

       1m+mesg	 22mTurn  on the 1mmessages 22mresource, i.e., allow write access to the
	       terminal.

       1m-mk_width0m
	       Set the 1mmkWidth 22mresource to ``true''.  This makes 4mxterm24m  use  a
	       built-in	 version of the wide-character width calculation.  The
	       default is ``false''

       1m+mk_width0m
	       Reset the 1mmkWidth 22mresource.

       1m-ms 4m22mcolor0m
	       This option specifies the color to  be  used  for  the  pointer
	       cursor.	The default is to use the foreground color.  This sets
	       the 4mpointerColor24m resource.

       1m-nb 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option specifies the number of characters from  the	 right
	       end  of a line at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring.
	       The default is 10.

       1m-nul	 22mThis option disables the display of underlining.

       1m+nul	 22mThis option enables the display of underlining.

       1m-pc	 22mThis option enables	 the  PC-style	use  of	 bold  colors  (see
	       boldColors resource).

       1m+pc	 22mThis option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.

       1m-pob	 22mThis option indicates that the window should be raised whenever
	       a Control-G is received.

       1m+pob	 22mThis option indicates that the  window  should  not	 be  raised
	       whenever a Control-G is received.

       1m-rightbar0m
	       Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.

       1m-rvc	 22mThis  option  disables  the	 display of characters with reverse
	       attribute as color.

       1m+rvc	 22mThis option enables the  display  of  characters  with  reverse
	       attribute as color.

       1m-rw	 22mThis   option   indicates  that  reverse-wraparound	 should	 be
	       allowed.	 This allows the cursor to back up from	 the  leftmost
	       column  of  one	line  to  the rightmost column of the previous
	       line.  This is very useful for editing long shell command lines
	       and  is	encouraged.  This option can be turned on and off from
	       the ``VT Options'' menu.

       1m+rw	 22mThis option indicates that	reverse-wraparound  should  not	 be
	       allowed.

       1m-s	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m may scroll asynchronously,
	       meaning that the screen does not have to be kept completely  up
	       to  date while scrolling.  This allows 4mxterm24m to run faster when
	       network latencies are very high and is  typically  useful  when
	       running across a very large internet or many gateways.

       1m+s	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should scroll synchronously.

       1m-samename0m
	       Does  not  send	title  and  icon name change requests when the
	       request would have no effect: the name is  not  changed.	  This
	       has the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of
	       requiring an extra round trip to the server  to	find  out  the
	       previous value.	In practice this should never be a problem.

       1m+samename0m
	       Always send title and icon name change requests.

       1m-sb	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  some	 number	 of  lines that are
	       scrolled off the top of the window should be saved and  that  a
	       scrollbar  should  be  displayed	 so  that  those  lines can be
	       viewed.	This option may be turned on and  off  from  the  ``VT
	       Options'' menu.

       1m+sb	 22mThis option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.

       1m-sf	 22mThis option indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should
	       be generated for function keys.

       1m+sf	 22mThis  option indicates that the standard escape codes should be
	       generated for function keys.

       1m-si	 22mThis option indicates  that	 output	 to  a	window	should	not
	       automatically  reposition  the  screen  to  the	bottom	of the
	       scrolling region.  This option can be turned on	and  off  from
	       the ``VT Options'' menu.

       1m+si	 22mThis  option  indicates that output to a window should cause it
	       to scroll to the bottom.

       1m-sk	 22mThis option indicates that	pressing  a  key  while	 using	the
	       scrollbar  to  review  previous	lines of text should cause the
	       window to be repositioned automatically in the normal  position
	       at the bottom of the scroll region.

       1m+sk	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  pressing  a	key while using the
	       scrollbar should not cause the window to be repositioned.

       1m-sl 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option specifies the number of lines  to  save  that  have
	       been  scrolled  off the top of the screen.  This corresponds to
	       the 1msaveLines 22mresource.  The default is 64.

       1m-sm	 22mThis  option,  corresponding  to   the   1msessionMgt   22mresource,
	       indicates that 4mxterm24m should set up session manager callbacks.

       1m+sm	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m  should not set up session
	       manager callbacks.

       1m-sp	 22mThis option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should  be  assumed,
	       providing  mapping  for	keypad `+' to `,', and CTRL-F1 to F13,
	       CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.

       1m+sp	 22mThis option indicates that the standard escape codes should	 be
	       generated for keypad and function keys.

       1m-t	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m  should start in Tektronix
	       mode, rather than in VT102 mode.	  Switching  between  the  two
	       windows	is  done  using	 the  ``Options''  menus.   4mTermcap24m(5)
	       entries	that  work  with   4mxterm24m	``tek4014,''   ``tek4015,''
	       ``tek4012'',  ``tek4013'' and ``tek4010,'' and ``dumb.''	 4mxterm0m
	       automatically searches the termcap file in this order for these
	       entries	 and  then  sets  the  ``TERM''	 and  the  ``TERMCAP''
	       environment variables.

       1m+t	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should start in VT102 mode.

       1m-tb	 22mThis option, corresponding to the 1mtoolBar	 22mresource,  indicates
	       that  4mxterm24m should display a toolbar (or menubar) at the top of
	       its window.  The buttons in the toolbar correspond to the popup
	       menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for "Main Options".

       1m+tb	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should not set up a toolbar.

       1m-ti 4m22mterm_id0m
	       Specify	the  name used by 4mxterm24m to select the correct response
	       to terminal ID queries.	It also specifies the emulation level,
	       used  to	 determine  the	 type  of  response  to	 a  DA control
	       sequence.  Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102,  and
	       vt220  (the  "vt"  is  optional).   The	default is vt100.  The
	       term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to  use.   (This  is
	       the same as the 1mdecTerminalID 22mresource).

       1m-tm 4m22mstring0m
	       This  option  specifies	a  series of terminal setting keywords
	       followed by the	characters  that  should  be  bound  to	 those
	       functions, similar to the 4mstty24m program.  The keywords and their
	       values are described in detail in the 1mttyModes 22mresource.

       1m-tn 4m22mname0m
	       This option specifies the name of the terminal type to  be  set
	       in  the	TERM  environment  variable.   It  corresponds	to the
	       1mtermName 22mresource.	 This  terminal	 type  must  exist  in	the
	       terminal	 database (termcap or terminfo, depending on how 4mxterm0m
	       is built) and should have 4mli#24m and 4mco#24m entries.	 If the terminal
	       type  is	 not  found,  4mxterm24m  uses the built-in list ``xterm'',
	       ``vt102'', etc.

       1m-u8	 22mThis option sets the 1mutf8 22mresource.  When 1mutf8  22mis  set,	4mxterm0m
	       interprets  incoming  data  as  UTF-8.  This sets the 1mwideChars0m
	       resource as a side-effect, but  the  UTF-8  mode	 set  by  this
	       option  prevents it from being turned off.  If you must turn it
	       on and off, use the 1mwideChars 22mresource.

	       This option and the 1mutf8 22mresource are overridden by the 1m-lc 22mand
	       1m-en  22moptions  and  1mlocale 22mresource.  That is, if 4mxterm24m has been
	       compiled to support  4mluit24m,	and  the  1mlocale  22mresource	 is  not
	       ``false''  this	option is ignored.  We recommend using the 1m-lc0m
	       option or the ``1mlocale: true22m'' resource in UTF-8  locales  when
	       your  operating	system supports locale, or 1m-en UTF-8 22moption or
	       the ``1mlocale: UTF-822m'' resource when your operating system  does
	       not support locale.

       1m+u8	 22mThis option resets the 1mutf8 22mresource.

       1m-ulc	 22mThis  option  disables the display of characters with underline
	       attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       1m+ulc	 22mThis option enables the display of	characters  with  underline
	       attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       1m-ut	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should not write a record into
	       the the system 4mutmp24m log file.

       1m+ut	 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should write a record into the
	       system 4mutmp24m log file.

       1m-vb	 22mThis  option  indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an
	       audible one.  Instead of ringing the terminal bell  whenever  a
	       Control-G is received, the window will be flashed.

       1m+vb	 22mThis option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.

       1m-wc	 22mThis  option  sets	the  1mwideChars 22mresource.  When 1mwideChars 22mis
	       set, 4mxterm24m maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters.
	       If  you do not set this resource to ``true'', 4mxterm24m will ignore
	       the escape sequence which turns UTF-8 mode  on  and  off.   The
	       default is ``false''.

       1m+wc	 22mThis option resets the 1mwideChars 22mresource.

       1m-wf	 22mThis  option indicates that 4mxterm24m should wait for the window to
	       be mapped the first time before starting the subprocess so that
	       the  initial  terminal  size settings and environment variables
	       are correct.  It is the application's responsibility  to	 catch
	       subsequent terminal size changes.

       1m+wf	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  4mxterm24m  should  not  wait  before
	       starting the subprocess.

       1m-ziconbeep 4m22mpercent0m
	       Same as zIconBeep resource.  If	percent	 is  non-zero,	xterms
	       that  produce  output while iconified will cause an XBell sound
	       at the given volume and have  "***"  prepended  to  their  icon
	       titles.	  Most	 window	  managers  will  detect  this	change
	       immediately, showing you	 which	window	has  the  output.   (A
	       similar feature was in x10 4mxterm24m.)

       1m-C	 22mThis  option  indicates that this window should receive console
	       output.	This is not  supported	on  all	 systems.   To	obtain
	       console	output,	 you  must be the owner of the console device,
	       and you must have read and write permission for it.  If you are
	       running	X under 4mxdm24m on the console screen you may need to have
	       the session startup and reset programs  explicitly  change  the
	       ownership  of the console device in order to get this option to
	       work.

       1m-S4m22mccn24m	 This option allows 4mxterm24m to be used  as  an  input  and  output
	       channel	for  an	 existing  program  and	 is  sometimes used in
	       specialized applications.  The option value specifies the  last
	       few  letters  of	 the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave
	       mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.	If the
	       option contains a ``/'' character, that delimits the characters
	       used for the pseudo-terminal name  from	the  file  descriptor.
	       Otherwise,  exactly two characters are used from the option for
	       the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.
	       Examples:
		      -S123/45
		      -Sab34

	       Note that 4mxterm24m does not close any file descriptor which it did
	       not open for its own use.  It is possible (though probably  not
	       portable)  to  have  an	application  which passes an open file
	       descriptor down to 4mxterm24m past  the	initialization	or  the	 1m-S0m
	       option to a process running in the 4mxterm24m.

       The  following  command	line  arguments are provided for compatibility
       with older versions.  They may not be supported in the next release  as
       the  X Toolkit provides standard options that accomplish the same task.

       1m%4m22mgeom24m	 This option specifies the preferred size and  position	 of  the
	       Tektronix   window.    It   is  shorthand  for  specifying  the
	       ``4m*tekGeometry24m'' resource.

	1m#4m22mgeom24m	 This option  specifies	 the  preferred	 position  of  the  icon
	       window.	 It  is shorthand for specifying the ``4m*iconGeometry24m''
	       resource.

       1m-T 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the title for  4mxterm24m's  windows.   It	 is
	       equivalent to 1m-title22m.

       1m-n 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the icon name for 4mxterm24m's windows.  It is
	       shorthand for specifying the ``4m*iconName24m'' resource.  Note that
	       this  is	 not the same as the toolkit option 1m-name 22m(see below).
	       The default icon name is the application name.

       1m-r	 22mThis option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
	       swapping	  the	foreground   and  background  colors.	It  is
	       equivalent to 1m-rv22m.

       1m-w 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option  specifies  the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding  the	 window.   It is equivalent to 1m-borderwidth 22mor
	       1m-bw22m.

       The following standard X Toolkit command line  arguments	 are  commonly
       used with 4mxterm24m:

       1m-bd 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the border of the
	       window.	 4mxterm24m  uses  the	X   Toolkit   default,	 which	 is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground''.

       1m-bg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the color to use for the background of
	       the window.  The default is ``XtDefaultBackground.''

       1m-bw 4m22mnumber0m
	       This option  specifies  the  width  in  pixels  of  the	border
	       surrounding the window.

       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option specifies the X server to contact; see 4mX(7)24m.

       1m-fg 4m22mcolor0m
	       This  option  specifies	the  color to use for displaying text.
	       The default is ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1m-fn 4m22mfont0m
	       This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal
	       text.  The default is 4mfixed24m.

       1m-font 4m22mfont0m
	       This is the same as 1m-fn22m.

       1m-geometry 4m22mgeometry0m
	       This  option  specifies	the preferred size and position of the
	       VT102 window; see 4mX(7)24m.

       1m-iconic 22mThis option indicates that 4mxterm24m should ask the window	 manager
	       to start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.

       1m-name 4m22mname0m
	       This   option   specifies  the  application  name  under	 which
	       resources  are  to  be  obtained,  rather  than	 the   default
	       executable  file	 name.	4mName24m should not contain ``.'' or ``*''
	       characters.

       1m-rv	 22mThis option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
	       swapping the foreground and background colors.

       1m+rv	 22mDisable  the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground
	       and background colors.

       1m-title 4m22mstring0m
	       This option specifies the window title  string,	which  may  be
	       displayed  by  window  managers	if  the	 user so chooses.  The
	       default title is	 the  command  line  specified	after  the  1m-e0m
	       option, if any, otherwise the application name.

       1m-xrm 4m22mresourcestring0m
	       This  option  specifies	a resource string to be used.  This is
	       especially useful  for  setting	resources  that	 do  not  have
	       separate command line options.

1mRESOURCES0m
       The  program  understands  all of the core X Toolkit resource names and
       classes.	 Application specific resources (e.g., "1mXTerm.4m22mNAME24m") follow:

       1mbackarrowKeyIsErase (22mclass 1mBackarrowKeyIsErase)0m
	       Tie  the	 VTxxx	1mbackarrowKey	22mand	1mptyInitialErase   22mresources
	       together	 by  setting the DECBKM state according to whether the
	       initial value of stty erase is a backspace (8) or delete	 (127)
	       character.   The	 default  is  ``false'',  which	 disables this
	       feature.

       1mhold (22mclass 1mHold)0m
	       If true, 4mxterm24m will not immediately destroy its window when the
	       shell command completes.	 It will wait until you use the window
	       manager to destroy/kill the window, or  if  you	use  the  menu
	       entries	that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.	You may scroll
	       back, select text, etc., to perform most graphical  operations.
	       Resizing	 the  display  will  lose  data,  however,  since this
	       involves interaction with the shell which is no longer running.

       1mhpFunctionKeys (22mclass 1mHpFunctionKeys)0m
	       Specifies whether or not HP Function Key escape codes should be
	       generated  for  function	 keys  instead	of   standard	escape
	       sequences.  See also the 1mkeyboardType 22mresource.

       1miconGeometry (22mclass 1mIconGeometry)0m
	       Specifies  the  preferred  size and position of the application
	       when iconified.	It is not necessarily  obeyed  by  all	window
	       managers.

       1miconName (22mclass 1mIconName)0m
	       Specifies  the icon name.  The default is the application name.

       1mkeyboardType (22mclass 1mKeyboardType)0m
	       Enables one (or none) of the various  keyboard-type  resources:
	       1mhpFunctionKeys22m,	1mscoFunctionKeys22m,	  1msunFunctionKeys    22mand
	       1msunKeyboard22m.   The	resource's  value  should  be  one  of	the
	       corresponding  strings  hp,  sco, sun or vt220.	The individual
	       resources are provided for legacy  support;  this  resource  is
	       simpler to use.

       1mmaxBufSize (22mclass 1mMaxBufSize)0m
	       Specify	the  maximum size of the input buffer.	The default is
	       32768.  You cannot set this to a value less than the 1mminBufSize0m
	       resource.   It  will  be increased as needed to make that value
	       evenly divide this one.

	       On some systems you may want to increase one  or	 both  of  the
	       1mmaxBufSize  22mand  1mminBufSize  22mresource	values to achieve better
	       performance if  the  operating  system  prefers	larger	buffer
	       sizes.

       1mmessages (22mclass 1mMessages)0m
	       Specifies  whether  write  access  to  the  terminal is allowed
	       initially.  See 1mmesg22m(1).  The default is ``true''.

       1mminBufSize (22mclass 1mMinBufSize)0m
	       Specify the minimum size of the input buffer, i.e., the	amount
	       of data that 4mxterm24m requests on each read.  The default is 4096.
	       You cannot set this to a value less than 64.

       1mptyHandshake (22mclass 1mPtyHandshake)0m
	       If   ``true'',	4mxterm24m   will   perform   handshaking    during
	       initialization  to  ensure  that the parent and child processes
	       update the 1mutmp 22mand 1mstty 22mstate.  The default is ``true''.

       1mptyInitialErase (22mclass 1mPtyInitialErase)0m
	       If ``true'', 4mxterm24m will use the pseudo-terminal's sense of	the
	       stty  erase value.  If ``false'', 4mxterm24m will set the stty erase
	       value to match its own configuration, using the 1mkb 22mstring  from
	       the  termcap  entry  as	a  reference, if available.  In either
	       case, the result is applied to the TERMCAP variable which 4mxterm0m
	       sets.  The default is ``false''.

       1msameName (22mclass 1mSameName)0m
	       If  the value of this resource is ``true'', 4mxterm24m does not send
	       title and icon name change requests when the request would have
	       no  effect: the name is not changed.  This has the advantage of
	       preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring  an	 extra
	       round  trip  to	the server to find out the previous value.  In
	       practice this should  never  be	a  problem.   The  default  is
	       ``true''.

       1mscoFunctionKeys (22mclass 1mScoFunctionKeys)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or not SCP Function Key escape codes should
	       be generated for	 function  keys	 instead  of  standard	escape
	       sequences.  See also the 1mkeyboardType 22mresource.

       1msessionMgt (22mclass 1mSessionMgt)0m
	       If  the	value  of  this	 resource  is  ``true'', 4mxterm24m sets up
	       session	  manager    callbacks	  for	 1mXtNdieCallback    22mand
	       1mXtNsaveCallback22m.  The default is ``true''.

       1msunFunctionKeys (22mclass 1mSunFunctionKeys)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or not Sun Function Key escape codes should
	       be generated for	 function  keys	 instead  of  standard	escape
	       sequences.  See also the 1mkeyboardType 22mresource.

       1msunKeyboard (22mclass 1mSunKeyboard)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  Sun/PC  keyboard  layout should be
	       assumed rather than DEC VT220.  This causes the keypad  `+'  to
	       be mapped to `,'.  and CTRL F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending on the
	       setting of the 1mctrlFKeys 22mresource.	so  4mxterm24m	emulates  a  DEC
	       VT220   more   accurately.    Otherwise	 (the	default,  with
	       1msunKeyboard 22mset to ``false''), 4mxterm24m uses PC-style bindings for
	       the function keys and keypad.

	       PC-style	 bindings use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as
	       modifiers for function-keys and keypad (see the document	 4mXterm0m
	       4mControl24m  4mSequences24m  for  details).   The  PC-style bindings are
	       analogous to PCTerm, but not the same  thing.   Normally	 these
	       bindings	 do  not  conflict  with  the  use  of the Meta key as
	       described for the 1meightBitInput 22mresource.	If  they  do,  note
	       that  the  PC-style bindings are evaluated first.  See also the
	       1mkeyboardType 22mresource.

       1mtermName (22mclass 1mTermName)0m
	       Specifies the  terminal	type  name  to	be  set	 in  the  TERM
	       environment variable.

       1mtitle (22mclass 1mTitle)0m
	       Specifies  a string that may be used by the window manager when
	       displaying this application.

       1mtoolBar (22mclass 1mToolBar)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the toolbar should be displayed.   The
	       default is ``true.''

       1mttyModes (22mclass 1mTtyModes)0m
	       Specifies a string containing terminal setting keywords and the
	       characters to which they	 may  be  bound.   Allowable  keywords
	       include:	 brk,  dsusp,  eof,  eol,  eol2, erase, erase2, flush,
	       intr, kill, lnext, quit,	 rprnt,	 start,	 status,  stop,	 susp,
	       swtch  and weras.  Control characters may be specified as ^char
	       (e.g., ^c or ^u) and 1m^? 22mmay be used to indicate  delete  (127).
	       Use  1m^-  22mto	 denote	 4mundef24m.   Use 1m\034 22mto represent 1m^\22m, since a
	       literal backslash in an X resource escapes the next  character.

	       This  is	 very  useful  for  overriding	the  default  terminal
	       settings without having to do an 4mstty24m every time  an  4mxterm24m  is
	       started.	  Note, however, that the stty program on a given host
	       may use different keywords; 4mxterm24m's table is built-in.

       1museInsertMode (22mclass 1mUseInsertMode)0m
	       Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries  to  the
	       TERMCAP	environment  variable.	 This  is useful if the system
	       termcap is broken.  The default is ``false.''

       1mutmpDisplayId (22mclass 1mUtmpDisplayId)0m
	       Specifies whether or not 4mxterm24m should try to record the display
	       identifier  (display  number  and screen number) as well as the
	       hostname in the system 4mutmp24m log file.  The default is ``true.''

       1mutmpInhibit (22mclass 1mUtmpInhibit)0m
	       Specifies  whether or not 4mxterm24m should try to record the user's
	       terminal in the system 4mutmp24m log file.  If true, 4mxterm24m will  not
	       try.  The default is ``false.''

       1mwaitForMap (22mclass 1mWaitForMap)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  4mxterm24m	should wait for the initial
	       window map before starting  the	subprocess.   The  default  is
	       ``false.''

       1mzIconBeep (22mclass 1mZIconBeep)0m
	       Same as -ziconbeep command line argument.  If the value of this
	       resource	 is  non-zero,	xterms	that  produce	output	 while
	       iconified  will	cause  an  XBell sound at the given volume and
	       have  "***"  prepended  to  their  icon	titles.	  Most	window
	       managers will detect this change immediately, showing you which
	       window has the output.  (A similar feature was in  x10  4mxterm24m.)
	       The default is ``false.''

       The  following  resources  are  specified  as  part of the 4mvt10024m widget
       (class	4mVT10024m):   These   are   specified	 by   patterns	 such	 as
       "1mXTerm.vt100.4m22mNAME24m":

       1mactiveIcon (22mclass 1mActiveIcon)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  active icon windows are to be used
	       when the 4mxterm24m window is iconified, if this feature is compiled
	       into  4mxterm24m.   The active icon is a miniature representation of
	       the content of the  window  and	will  update  as  the  content
	       changes.	   Not	 all   window	managers  necessarily  support
	       application icon windows.  Some window managers will allow  you
	       to  enter  keystrokes into the active icon window.  The default
	       is ``false.''

       1mallowC1Printable (22mclass 1mAllowC1Printable)0m
	       If true, overrides the mapping of C1 controls  (codes  128-159)
	       to  make	 them be treated as if they were printable characters.
	       Although this corresponds to no particular standard, some users
	       insist it is a VT100.  The default is ``false.''

       1mallowSendEvents (22mclass 1mAllowSendEvents)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  synthetic  key  and	 button events
	       (generated using the X protocol SendEvent  request)  should  be
	       interpreted  or	discarded.   The  default is ``false'' meaning
	       they are discarded.  Note that allowing such events  creates  a
	       very large security hole.  The default is ``false.''

       1mallowWindowOps (22mclass 1mAllowWindowOps)0m
	       Specifies whether extended window control sequences (as used in
	       dtterm) for should be allowed.  The default is ``true.''

       1malwaysHighlight (22mclass 1mAlwaysHighlight)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  4mxterm24m	should	always	display	  a
	       highlighted  text  cursor.   By	default	 (if  this resource is
	       false), a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the  pointer
	       moves  out  of  the window or the window loses the input focus.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1malwaysUseMods (22mclass 1mAlwaysUseMods)0m
	       Override the 1mnumLock 22mresource, telling 4mxterm24m to use the Alt and
	       Meta   modifiers	 to  construct	parameters  for	 function  key
	       sequences even if those modifiers appear	 in  the  translations
	       resource.  The default is ``false.''

       1manswerbackString (22mclass 1mAnswerbackString)0m
	       Specifies  the  string  that  4mxterm24m sends in response to an ENQ
	       (control/E) character from the host.  The default  is  a	 blank
	       string,	i.e.,  ``''.  A hardware VT100 implements this feature
	       as a setup option.

       1mappcursorDefault (22mclass 1mAppcursorDefault)0m
	       If ``true,'' the cursor keys are initially in application mode.
	       This  is the same as the VT102 private DECCKM mode, The default
	       is ``false.''

       1mappkeypadDefault (22mclass 1mAppkeypadDefault)0m
	       If ``true,'' the keypad keys are initially in application mode.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1mautoWrap (22mclass 1mAutoWrap)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  auto-wraparound should be enabled.
	       This is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.  The default is ``true.''

       1mawaitInput (22mclass 1mAwaitInput)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  the	 4mxterm24m  uses  a 50 millisecond
	       timeout to await	 input	(i.e.,	to  support  the  Xaw3d	 arrow
	       scrollbar).  The default is ``false.''

       1mbackarrowKey (22mclass 1mBackarrowKey)0m
	       Specifies  whether  the backarrow key transmits a backspace (8)
	       or delete (127) character.   This  corresponds  to  the	DECBKM
	       control	 sequence.    The  default  (backspace)	 is  ``true.''
	       Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.

       1mbackground (22mclass 1mBackground)0m
	       Specifies the color to use for the background  of  the  window.
	       The default is ``XtDefaultBackground.''

       1mbellOnReset (22mclass 1mBellOnReset)0m
	       Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.  The
	       default is ``true.''

       1mbellSuppressTime (22mclass 1mBellSuppressTime)0m
	       Number of milliseconds after a  bell  command  is  sent	during
	       which additional bells will be suppressed.  Default is 200.  If
	       set non-zero, additional bells will also	 be  suppressed	 until
	       the  server  reports that processing of the first bell has been
	       completed; this feature is most useful with the visible bell.

       1mboldColors (22mclass 1mColorMode)0m
	       Specifies whether to combine bold attribute  with  colors  like
	       the  IBM	 PC,  i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through
	       15.  These normally are the brighter versions of	 the  first  8
	       colors, hence bold.  The default is ``true.''

       1mboldFont (22mclass 1mBoldFont)0m
	       Specifies  the  name  of	 the  bold  font  to  use  instead  of
	       overstriking.  There is no default for this resource.

       1mboldMode (22mclass 1mBoldMode)0m
	       This specifies whether or not  text  with  the  bold  attribute
	       should  be  overstruck  to  simulate bold fonts if the resolved
	       bold font is the same as the normal font.  It may be  desirable
	       to  disable  bold  fonts	 when color is being used for the bold
	       attribute.  Note that 4mxterm24m has one bold font which you may set
	       explicitly.   It	 attempts  to  match a bold font for the other
	       font selections (1mfont1 22mthrough 1mfont622m).	 If the normal and  bold
	       fonts  are  distinct, this resource has no effect.  The default
	       is ``true.''

	       Although 4mxterm24m attempts to match a bold  font  for	other  font
	       selections,  the	 font  server may not cooperate.  Since X11R6,
	       bitmap fonts have been  scaled.	 The  font  server  claims  to
	       provide	the  bold  font that 4mxterm24m requests, but the result is
	       not always readable.  XFree86 provides a feature which  can  be
	       used  to suppress the scaling.  In the X server's configuration
	       file (e.g., "/etc/X11/XFree86"), you can add ":unscaled" to the
	       end  of the directory specification for the "misc" fonts, which
	       comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are	used  by  4mxterm24m.	For
	       example
		    FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"

	       would become
		    FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"

	       Depending  on  your configuration, the font server may have its
	       own configuration file.	The same ":unscaled" can be  added  to
	       its   configuration   file   at	 the   end  of	the  directory
	       specification for "misc".

       1mbrokenLinuxOSC (22mclass 1mBrokenLinuxOSC)0m
	       If true, 4mxterm24m applies a workaround to ignore malformed control
	       sequences  that a Linux script might send.  Compare the palette
	       control sequences documented  in	 4mconsole_codes24m  with  ECMA-48.
	       The default is ``true.''

       1mbrokenSelections (22mclass 1mBrokenSelections)0m
	       If  true,  4mxterm24m in 8-bit mode will interpret 1mSTRING 22mselections
	       as carrying text in the current	locale's  encoding.   Normally
	       1mSTRING	 22mselections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.  Setting this
	       resource to ``true'' violates the ICCCM; it  may,  however,  be
	       useful for interacting with some broken X clients.  The default
	       is ``false.''

       1mbrokenStringTerm (22mclass 1mBrokenStringTerm)0m
	       provides a work-around for some ISDN  routers  which  start  an
	       application  control string without completing it.  Set this to
	       ``true'' if 4mxterm24m  appears	to  freeze  when  connecting.	The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mc132 (22mclass 1mC132)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence,
	       used to switch between 80 and 132 columns, should  be  honored.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1mcacheDoublesize (22mclass 1mCacheDoublesize)0m
	       Specifies  the  maximum	number of double-sized fonts which are
	       cached by 4mxterm24m.  The default (8) may be too large for  some  X
	       terminals  with	limited	 memory.   Set this to zero to disable
	       doublesize fonts altogether.

       1mcharClass (22mclass 1mCharClass)0m
	       Specifies comma-separated lists of character class bindings  of
	       the form [4mlow24m-]4mhigh24m:4mvalue24m.  These are used in determining which
	       sets of characters should be treated the same  when  doing  cut
	       and paste.  See the 1mCHARACTER CLASSES 22msection.

       1mcjkWidth (22mclass 1mCjkWidth)0m
	       Specifies  whether  4mxterm24m  should  follow  the traditional East
	       Asian width convention.	When turned on, characters  with  East
	       Asian  Ambiguous	 (A) category in UTR 11 have a column width of
	       2.  You may have to set this option to  ``true''	 if  you  have
	       some  old  East	Asian terminal based programs that assume that
	       line-drawing characters have a column width of 2.  The  default
	       is ``false.''

       1mcolor0 (22mclass 1mColor0)0m

       1mcolor1 (22mclass 1mColor1)0m

       1mcolor2 (22mclass 1mColor2)0m

       1mcolor3 (22mclass 1mColor3)0m

       1mcolor4 (22mclass 1mColor4)0m

       1mcolor5 (22mclass 1mColor5)0m

       1mcolor6 (22mclass 1mColor6)0m

       1mcolor7 (22mclass 1mColor7)0m
	       These  specify  the  colors  for	 the  ISO 6429 extension.  The
	       defaults are, respectively, black,  red3,  green3,  yellow3,  a
	       customizable  dark  blue,  magenta3,  cyan3,  and  gray90.  The
	       default shades of color are chosen to allow the colors 8-15  to
	       be used as brighter versions.

       1mcolor8 (22mclass 1mColor8)0m

       1mcolor9 (22mclass 1mColor9)0m

       1mcolor10 (22mclass 1mColor10)0m

       1mcolor11 (22mclass 1mColor11)0m

       1mcolor12 (22mclass 1mColor12)0m

       1mcolor13 (22mclass 1mColor13)0m

       1mcolor14 (22mclass 1mColor14)0m

       1mcolor15 (22mclass 1mColor15)0m
	       These specify the colors for the ISO 6429 extension if the bold
	       attribute is also enabled.  The	default	 resource  values  are
	       respectively,  gray30, red, green, yellow, a customizable light
	       blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

       1mcolor16 (22mclass 1mColor16)0m

       through

       1mcolor255 (22mclass 1mColor255)0m
	       These specify the colors	 for  the  256-color  extension.   The
	       default resource values are for colors 16 through 231 to make a
	       6x6x6 color  cube,  and	colors	232  through  255  to  make  a
	       grayscale ramp.

       1mcolorAttrMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies whether 1mcolorBD22m, 1mcolorBL22m, 1mcolorRV22m, and 1mcolorUL 22mshould
	       override ANSI colors.  If not, these are displayed only when no
	       ANSI  colors have been set for the corresponding position.  The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mcolorBD (22mclass 1mColorBD)0m
	       This specifies the color to use to display bold	characters  if
	       the  ``colorBDMode''  resource  is  enabled.   The  default  is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mcolorBDMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies whether characters with the bold attribute should  be
	       displayed  in  color  or as bold characters.  Note that setting
	       1mcolorMode 22moff disables all colors, including bold.	The default
	       is ``false.''

       1mcolorBL (22mclass 1mColorBL)0m
	       This  specifies the color to use to display blink characters if
	       the  ``colorBLMode''  resource  is  enabled.   The  default  is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mcolorBLMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies whether characters with the blink attribute should be
	       displayed in color.  Note that setting 1mcolorMode  22moff  disables
	       all colors, including this.  The default is ``false.''

       1mcolorMode (22mclass 1mColorMode)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or not recognition of ANSI (ISO 6429) color
	       change escape sequences should  be  enabled.   The  default  is
	       ``true.''

       1mcolorRV (22mclass 1mColorRV)0m
	       This  specifies	the color to use to display reverse characters
	       if the ``colorRVMode'' resource is  enabled.   The  default  is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mcolorRVMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies  whether characters with the reverse attribute should
	       be  displayed  in  color.   Note	 that  setting	1mcolorMode  22moff
	       disables all colors, including this.  The default is ``false.''

       1mcolorUL (22mclass 1mColorUL)0m
	       This  specifies	the  color  to	use  to	  display   underlined
	       characters  if  the  ``colorULMode''  resource is enabled.  The
	       default is ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mcolorULMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies  whether  characters  with  the  underline  attribute
	       should be displayed in color or as underlined characters.  Note
	       that setting  1mcolorMode  22moff  disables  all	 colors,  including
	       underlining.  The default is ``false.''

       1mctrlFKeys (22mclass 1mCtrlFKeys)0m
	       In  VT220  keyboard  mode (see 1msunKeyboard 22mresource), specifies
	       the amount by which to shift F1-F12 given  a  control  modifier
	       (CTRL).	This allows you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on
	       a Sun/PC keyboard.  The default is  ``10'',  which  means  that
	       CTRL F1 generates the key symbol for F11.

       1mcurses (22mclass 1mCurses)0m
	       Specifies  whether or not the last column bug in 4mmore24m(1) should
	       be worked around.  See the 1m-cu 22moption for details.	The default
	       is ``false.''

       1mcursorBlink (22mclass 1mCursorBlink)0m
	       Specifies  whether  to  make  the cursor blink.	The default is
	       ``false.''

       1mcursorColor (22mclass 1mCursorColor)0m
	       Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.	The default is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground.''	  4mXterm24m  attempts	to  keep this color
	       from being the same as the background color, since it draws the
	       cursor  by  filling  the	 background  of a text cell.  The same
	       restriction applies to control sequences which may change  this
	       color.

       1mcursorOffTime (22mclass 1mCursorOffTime)0m
	       Specifies  the  duration	 of the "off" part of the cursor blink
	       cycle-time in milliseconds.  The same timer is  used  for  text
	       blinking.  The default is 300.

       1mcursorOnTime (22mclass 1mCursorOnTime)0m
	       Specifies  the  duration	 of  the "on" part of the cursor blink
	       cycle-time, in milliseconds.  The same timer is used  for  text
	       blinking.  The default is 600.

       1mcutNewline (22mclass 1mCutNewline)0m
	       If ``false'', triple clicking to select a line does not include
	       the Newline at the end of the line.  If ``true'',  the  Newline
	       is selected.  The default is ``true.''

       1mcutToBeginningOfLine (22mclass 1mCutToBeginningOfLine)0m
	       If  ``false'',  triple  clicking	 to select a line selects only
	       from the current word forward.  If ``true'', the entire line is
	       selected.  The default is ``true.''

       1mdecTerminalID (22mclass 1mDecTerminalID)0m
	       Specifies  the  emulation  level	 (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.),
	       used to	determine  the	type  of  response  to	a  DA  control
	       sequence.   Leading  non-digit  characters  are	ignored, e.g.,
	       "vt100" and "100" are the same.	The default is 100.

       1mdeleteIsDEL (22mclass 1mDeleteIsDEL)0m
	       Specifies whether the Delete key on the editing	keypad	should
	       send  DEL (127) or the VT220-style Remove escape sequence.  The
	       default is ``false,'' for the latter.

       1mdynamicColors (22mclass 1mDynamicColors)0m
	       Specifies whether or not	 escape	 sequences  to	change	colors
	       assigned to different attributes are recognized.

       1meightBitControl (22mclass 1mEightBitControl22m)
	       Specifies whether or not control sequences sent by the terminal
	       should  be  eight-bit  characters  or  escape  sequences.   The
	       default is ``false.''

       1meightBitInput (22mclass 1mEightBitInput22m)
	       If  ``true'', Meta characters (a single-byte character combined
	       with the	 4mkeys24m  modifier  key)  input  from	 the  keyboard	are
	       presented  as a single character with the eighth bit turned on.
	       The terminal is	put  into  8-bit  mode.	  If  ``false'',  Meta
	       characters are converted into a two-character sequence with the
	       character itself preceded by ESC.  On startup, 4mxterm24m  tries	 to
	       put the terminal into 7-bit mode.  The 1mmetaSendsEscape 22mresource
	       may override this.  The default is ``true.''

	       Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled "Meta", but "Alt"
	       keys  are  common, and they are conventionally used for "Meta".
	       If they were synonymous, it would have been reasonable to  name
	       this  resource "altSendsEscape", reversing its sense.  For more
	       background on this, see the 1mmeta 22mfunction in curses.

	       Note that the 4mAlt24m key is not necessarily the same as  the  4mMeta0m
	       modifier.    4mxmodmap24m  lists	 your  key  modifiers.	 X  defines
	       modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and  control,  as  well	 as  5
	       additional  modifiers which are generally used to configure key
	       modifiers.  4mxterm24m inspects the same	 information  to  find	the
	       modifier	 associated  with either 4mMeta24m key (left or right), and
	       uses that key as the 4mMeta24m modifier.	  It  also  looks  for	the
	       NumLock key, to recognize the modifier which is associated with
	       that.

	       If your 4mxmodmap24m configuration uses the same keycodes  for  Alt-
	       and  Meta-keys,	4mxterm24m  will  only see the Alt-key definitions,
	       since those are tested before  Meta-keys.   NumLock  is	tested
	       first.	It is important to keep these keys distinct; otherwise
	       some of 4mxterm24m's functionality is not available.

       1meightBitOutput (22mclass 1mEightBitOutput22m)
	       Specifies whether or not eight-bit  characters  sent  from  the
	       host  should  be	 accepted as is or stripped when printed.  The
	       default is ``true,'' which means that they are accepted as  is.

       1mfaceName (22mclass 1mFaceName)0m
	       Specify	the  pattern  for  fonts  selected  from  the FreeType
	       library if support for that library was	compiled  into	4mxterm24m.
	       There is no default.  If not specified, or if there is no match
	       for both normal and bold fonts, 4mxterm24m uses the 1mfont 22mand related
	       resources.

       1mfaceNameDoublesize (22mclass 1mFaceNameDoublesize)0m
	       Specify	an  double-width  font	for cases where an application
	       requires this, e.g., in CJK applications.  There is no default.
	       If   the	 application  uses  double-wide	 characters  and  this
	       resource is not given, 4mxterm24m  will use a scaled version of	the
	       font given by 1mfaceName22m.

       1mfaceSize (22mclass 1mFaceSize)0m
	       Specify	the  pointsize	for  fonts  selected from the FreeType
	       library if support for that library was	compiled  into	4mxterm24m.
	       The default is ``14.''

       1mfont (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies  the  name  of	 the  normal  font.   The  default  is
	       ``fixed.''

	       See the discussion of the 1mlocale 22mresource, which describes	how
	       this font may be overridden.

	       NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as
	       *font: fixed

	       which are overly broad, affecting both
	       xterm.vt100.font

	       and
	       xterm.vt100..utf8fonts.font

	       which is probably not what you intended.

       1mfont1 (22mclass 1mFont1)0m
	       Specifies the name of the first alternative font.

       1mfont2 (22mclass 1mFont2)0m
	       Specifies the name of the second alternative font.

       1mfont3 (22mclass 1mFont3)0m
	       Specifies the name of the third alternative font.

       1mfont4 (22mclass 1mFont4)0m
	       Specifies the name of the fourth alternative font.

       1mfont5 (22mclass 1mFont5)0m
	       Specifies the name of the fifth alternative font.

       1mfont6 (22mclass 1mFont6)0m
	       Specifies the name of the sixth alternative font.

       1mfontDoublesize (22mclass 1mFontDoublesize)0m
	       Specifies  whether  4mxterm24m should attempt to use font scaling to
	       draw doublesize characters.  Some older font servers cannot  do
	       this  properly,	will  return  misleading  font	metrics.   The
	       default	is  ``true''.	If  disabled,  4mxterm24m   will   simulate
	       doublesize  characters by drawing normal characters with spaces
	       between them.

       1mforceBoxChars (22mclass 1mForceBoxChars)0m
	       Specifies whether 4mxterm24m should assume the normal and bold fonts
	       have VT100 line-drawing characters:

	       -    The	 fixed-pitch  ISO-8859-*-encoded  fonts	 used by 4mxterm0m
		    normally have the VT100 line-drawing glyphs in cells 1-31.
		    Other  fixed-pitch	fonts may be more attractive, but lack
		    these glyphs.

	       -    When using an ISO-10646-1 font and the 1mwideChars	22mresource
		    is	true,  4mxterm24m  uses	 the Unicode glyphs which match the
		    VT100 line-drawing glyphs.

	       If ``false'', 4mxterm24m checks for missing glyphs in the  font	and
	       makes line-drawing characters directly as needed.  If ``true'',
	       4mxterm24m uses whatever is  in	the  font  without  checking.	The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies  the  color to use for displaying text in the window.
	       Setting the class name instead of the instance name is an  easy
	       way  to	have everything that would normally appear in the text
	       color change color.  The default is ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mfreeBoldBox (22mclass 1mfreeBoldBox)0m
	       Specifies whether 4mxterm24m should assume the  bounding	 boxes	for
	       normal  and  bold  fonts	 are  compatible.  If ``false'', 4mxterm0m
	       compares them and will reject choices of bold fonts that do not
	       match  the  size of the normal font.  The default is ``false'',
	       which means that the comparison is performed.

       1mgeometry (22mclass 1mGeometry)0m
	       Specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102  window.
	       There is no default for this resource.

       1mhighlightColor (22mclass 1mHighlightColor)0m
	       Specifies  the  color  to use for the background of selected or
	       otherwise highlighted text.  If not specified, reverse video is
	       used.  The default is ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mhighlightSelection (22mclass 1mHighlightSelection)0m
	       If ``false'', selecting with the mouse highlights all positions
	       on the screen between the beginning of the  selection  and  the
	       current	position.   If	``true'',  4mxterm24m  highlights  only the
	       positions that contain text that can be selected.  The  default
	       is ``false.''

	       Depending  on  the  way	your applications write to the screen,
	       there may be trailing blanks on a line.	4mXterm24m stores  data	 as
	       it  is  shown  on  the screen.  Erasing the display changes the
	       internal state of each cell so it is not considered a blank for
	       the  purpose of selection.  Blanks written since the last erase
	       are selectable.	If you do not wish to have trailing blanks  in
	       a selection, use the 1mtrimSelection 22mresource.

       1mhpLowerleftBugCompat (22mclass 1mHpLowerleftBugCompat)0m
	       Specifies  whether  to  work  around  a	bug in HP's 4mxdb24m, which
	       ignores termcap and always sends ESC F to  move	to  the	 lower
	       left  corner.   ``true''	 causes	 4mxterm24m to interpret ESC F as a
	       request to move to the lower left corner of  the	 screen.   The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mi18nSelections (22mclass 1mI18nSelections)0m
	       If false, 4mxterm24m will never request the targets 1mCOMPOUND_TEXT 22mor
	       1mTEXT22m.  The default is ``true.'' It may be set to false in order
	       to work around ICCCM violations by other X clients.

       1miconBorderColor (22mclass 1mBorderColor)0m
	       Specifies  the  border color for the active icon window if this
	       feature is compiled into 4mxterm24m.  Not all window  managers  will
	       make the icon border visible.

       1miconBorderWidth (22mclass 1mBorderWidth)0m
	       Specifies  the  border width for the active icon window if this
	       feature is compiled into 4mxterm24m.  The default  is  2.   Not	all
	       window managers will make the border visible.

       1miconFont (22mclass 1mIconFont)0m
	       Specifies  the  font  for  the miniature active icon window, if
	       this feature is compiled into 4mxterm24m.  The default is "nil2".

       1minternalBorder (22mclass 1mBorderWidth)0m
	       Specifies the number of pixels between the characters  and  the
	       window border.  The default is 2.

       1mitalicULMode (22mclass 1mColorAttrMode)0m
	       Specifies  whether  characters  with  the  underline  attribute
	       should  be  displayed  in  an  italic  font  or	as  underlined
	       characters.

       1mjumpScroll (22mclass 1mJumpScroll)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  jump  scroll should be used.  This
	       corresponds to the VT102 DECSCLM private mode.  The default  is
	       ``true.''

       1mkeyboardDialect (22mclass 1mKeyboardDialect)0m
	       Specifies  the initial keyboard dialect, as well as the default
	       value when the terminal is reset.  The value given is the  same
	       as  the	final  character in the control sequences which change
	       character sets.	The default is ``B'', which corresponds to  US
	       ASCII.

       4mname24m1mKeymap (class 4m22mName24m1mKeymap)0m
	       See the discussion of the 1mkeymap() 22maction.

       1mlimitResize (22mclass 1mLimitResize)0m
	       Limits  resizing	 of the screen via control sequence to a given
	       multiple of the display dimensions.  The default is ``1''.

       1mlocale (22mclass 1mLocale)0m
	       Specifies how to use 4mluit24m, an encoding converter between  UTF-8
	       and  locale  encodings.	The resource value (ignoring case) may
	       be:

	       4mtrue0m
		   4mxterm24m  will  use  the  encoding	 specified  by	the  users'
		   LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG variables)
		   as far as possible.	This is realized  by  always  enabling
		   UTF-8 mode and invoking 4mluit24m in non-UTF-8 locales.

	       4mmedium0m
		   4mxterm24m  will  follow  users' LC_CTYPE locale only for UTF-8,
		   east Asian, and Thai locales, where the encodings were  not
		   supported  by  conventional	8bit mode with changing fonts.
		   For other locales, 4mxterm24m will use conventional 8bit mode.

	       4mcheckfont0m
		   If mini-luit is compiled-in, 4mxterm24m will check if a  Unicode
		   font has been specified.  If so, it checks if the character
		   encoding for	 the  current  locale  is  POSIX,  Latin-1  or
		   Latin-9, uses the appropriate mapping to support those with
		   the Unicode font.  For other encodings, 4mxterm24m assumes  that
		   UTF-8 encoding is required.

	       4mfalse0m
		   4mxterm24m  will  use  conventional	8bit  mode  or	UTF-8  mode
		   according to 1mutf8 22mresource or 1m-u8 22moption.

	       Any other value, e.g., ``UTF-8'' or ``ISO8859-2'',  is  assumed
	       to  be  an  encoding  name; 4mluit24m will be invoked to support the
	       encoding.  The actual list of supported	encodings  depends  on
	       4mluit24m.  The default is ``medium''.

	       Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need an ISO-10646-1
	       font to display the result.  Your configuration may not include
	       this  font,  or	locale-support by 4mxterm24m may not be needed.	 At
	       startup, 4mxterm24m uses a  mechanism  equivalent  to  the  1mload-vt-0m
	       1mfonts(utf8Fonts, Utf8Fonts)	22maction   to	 load	font   name
	       subresources of the VT100 widget.  That is,  resource  patterns
	       such  as	 "1m*vt100.utf8Fonts.font22m"  will be loaded, and (if this
	       resource	 is  enabled),	override  the  normal  fonts.	If  no
	       subresources are found, the normal fonts such as "1m*vt100.font22m",
	       etc., are used.	The resource files distributed with 4mxterm24m	use
	       ISO-10646-1 fonts, but do not rely on them unless you are using
	       the locale mechanism.

       1mlocaleFilter (22mclass 1mLocaleFilter)0m
	       Specifies the file name	for  the  encoding  converter  from/to
	       locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with the 1m-lc 22moption or
	       1mlocale 22mresource.  The help message	shown  by  ``xterm  -help''
	       lists   the   default  value,  which  depends  on  your	system
	       configuration.

       1mloginShell (22mclass 1mLoginShell)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the shell to  be  run  in  the	window
	       should  be started as a login shell.  The default is ``false.''

       1mmarginBell (22mclass 1mMarginBell)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the bell should be rung when the  user
	       types near the right margin.  The default is ``false.''

       1mmetaSendsEscape (22mclass 1mMetaSendsEscape22m)
	       If  ``true'',  Meta  characters	(a character combined with the
	       4mMeta24m modifier key) are converted into a two-character  sequence
	       with  the  character  itself  preceded by ESC.  This applies as
	       well to function key control sequences, unless 4mxterm24m sees  that
	       1mMeta  22mis  used  in	your  key translations.	 If ``false'', Meta
	       characters input from the keyboard are handled according to the
	       1meightBitInput 22mresource.  The default is ``false.''

       1mmkWidth (22mclass 1mMkWidth)0m
	       Specifies  whether  4mxterm24m  should use a built-in version of the
	       wide character width calculation.  The default is ``false.''

       1mmodifyCursorKeys (22mclass 1mModifyCursorKeys22m)
	       Tells how to handle the special case  where  Control-,  Shift-,
	       Alt-  or	 Meta-modifiers	 are  used  to	add a parameter to the
	       escape sequence returned	 by  a	cursor-key.   The  default  is
	       ``2'':

	       Set it to 0 to use the old/obsolete behavior.
	       Set it to 1 to prefix modified sequences with CSI.
	       Set it to 2 to force the modifier to be the second parameter.
	       Set  it to 3 to mark the sequence with a '>' to hint that it is
	       private.

       1mmodifyOtherKeys (22mclass 1mModifyOtherKeys22m)
	       Like 1mmodifyCursorKeys22m,  tells  4mxterm24m  to  construct  an  escape
	       sequence	 for  other  keys  (such  as  "2")  when  modified  by
	       Control-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers.  This feature does not	 apply
	       to  function  keys  and	well-defined  keys  such as ESC or the
	       control keys.  The default is ``0'':

	       Set it to 0 to disable this feature.
	       Set it to 1 to enable this feature for keys except Tab and some
	       special	control character cases, e.g., Control-Space to make a
	       NUL.
	       Set it to 1 to enable  this  feature  for  keys	including  the
	       exceptions listed.

       1mmultiClickTime (22mclass 1mMultiClickTime)0m
	       Specifies  the maximum time in milliseconds between multi-click
	       select events.  The default is 250 milliseconds.

       1mmultiScroll (22mclass 1mMultiScroll)0m
	       Specifies   whether   or	  not	scrolling   should   be	  done
	       asynchronously.	The default is ``false.''

       1mnMarginBell (22mclass 1mColumn)0m
	       Specifies  the  number  of  characters from the right margin at
	       which the margin bell should be rung, when enabled.

       1mnumLock (22mclass 1mNumLock)0m
	       If ``true'', 4mxterm24m checks if NumLock is used as a modifier (see
	       4mxmodmap24m(1)).   If  so,  this  modifier  is used to simplify the
	       logic when implementing special	NumLock	 for  the  1msunKeyboard0m
	       resource.   Also	 (when 1msunKeyboard 22mis false), similar logic is
	       used to find the modifier associated with the  left  and	 right
	       Alt keys.  The default is ``true.''

       1moldXtermFKeys (22mclass 1mOldXtermFKeys)0m
	       If  ``true'',  4mxterm24m  will	use old-style control sequences for
	       function keys F1 to F4, for  compatibility  with	 X  Consortium
	       4mxterm24m.   Otherwise,	 it  uses  the VT100-style codes for PF1 to
	       PF4.  The default is ``false.''

       1mon2Clicks (22mclass 1mOn2Clicks)0m

       1mon3Clicks (22mclass 1mOn3Clicks)0m

       1mon4Clicks (22mclass 1mOn4Clicks)0m

       1mon5Clicks (22mclass 1mOn5Clicks)0m
	       Specify	selection  behavior  in	 response  to  multiple	 mouse
	       clicks.	  A  single  mouse  click  is  always  interpreted  as
	       described  in  the  1mSELECTION	22msection  (see  1mPOINTER   USAGE22m).
	       Multiple	 mouse	clicks	(using	the button which activates the
	       1mselect-start 22maction) are interpreted according to the  resource
	       values  of  1mon2Clicks22m,  etc.   The resource value can be one of
	       these:

	       word
		  Select a ``word'' as determined by the  1mcharClass  22mresource.
		  See the 1mCHARACTER CLASSES 22msection.

	       line
		  Select a line (counting wrapping).

	       group
		  Select  a  group of adjacent lines (counting wrapping).  The
		  selection stops on a blank line.

	       page
		  Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.

	       all
		  Select all lines, i.e., including the saved lines.

	       regex
		  Select a ``word'' as determined by  the  regular  expression
		  which follows in the resource value.

	       none
		  No selection action is associated with this resource.	 4mxterm0m
		  interprets it as the end of the list.	 For example, you  may
		  use  it  to  disable triple (and higher) clicking by setting
		  1mon3Clicks 22mto ``none''.

	       The default values for 1mon2Clicks 22mand 1mon3Clicks 22mare ``word'' and
	       ``line'',   respectively.    There  is  no  default  value  for
	       1mon4Clicks 22mor 1mon5Clicks22m, making	 those	inactive.   On	startup,
	       4mxterm24m  determines the maximum number of clicks by the 1mon4m22mX24m1mClicks0m
	       resource values which are set.

       1mpointerColor (22mclass 1mPointerColor)0m
	       Specifies the foreground color of the pointer.  The default  is
	       ``XtDefaultForeground.''

       1mpointerColorBackground (22mclass 1mPointerColorBackground)0m
	       Specifies  the background color of the pointer.	The default is
	       ``XtDefaultBackground.''

       1mpointerShape (22mclass 1mCursor)0m
	       Specifies the name of the shape of the pointer.	The default is
	       ``xterm.''

       1mpopOnBell (22mclass 1mPopOnBell)0m
	       Specifies  whether the window would be raised when Control-G is
	       received.  The default is ``false.''

       1mprintAttributes (22mclass 1mPrintAttributes)0m
	       Specifies whether to print graphic attributes  along  with  the
	       text.   A  real	DEC  VTxxx  terminal will print the underline,
	       highlighting codes but your printer may not  handle  these.   A
	       ``0''  disables	the attributes.	 A ``1'' prints the normal set
	       of  attributes  (bold,  underline,  inverse   and   blink)   as
	       VT100-style  control  sequences.	  A  ``2''  prints  ANSI color
	       attributes as well.  The default is ``1.''

       1mprinterAutoClose (22mclass 1mPrinterAutoClose)0m
	       If ``true'', 4mxterm24m will close the printer  (a  pipe)  when	the
	       application  switches  the  printer  offline  with a Media Copy
	       command.	 The default is ``false.''

       1mprinterCommand (22mclass 1mPrinterCommand)0m
	       Specifies a shell command to which 4mxterm24m will open a pipe  when
	       the first MC (Media Copy) command is initiated.	The default is
	       a blank string.	If the resource value  is  given  as  a	 blank
	       string, the printer is disabled.

       1mprinterControlMode (22mclass 1mPrinterControlMode)0m
	       Specifies  the printer control mode.  A ``1'' selects autoprint
	       mode, which causes 4mxterm24m to print a line from the  screen  when
	       you  move  the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed
	       or vertical tab character, or an	 autowrap  occurs.   Autoprint
	       mode  is overridden by printer controller mode (a ``2''), which
	       causes all of the output to be directed to  the	printer.   The
	       default is ``0.''

       1mprinterExtent (22mclass 1mPrinterExtent)0m
	       Controls	 whether  a  print page function will print the entire
	       page (true), or only  the  the  portion	within	the  scrolling
	       margins (false).	 The default is ``false.''

       1mprinterFormFeed (22mclass 1mPrinterFormFeed)0m
	       Controls	 whether a form feed is sent to the printer at the end
	       of a print page function.  The default is ``false.''

       1mrenderFont (22mclass 1mRenderFont)0m
	       If 4mxterm24m is built with the Xft library, this  controls  whether
	       the 1mfaceName 22mresource is used.  The default is ``true.''

       1mresizeGravity (22mclass 1mResizeGravity)0m
	       Affects the behavior when the window is resized to be taller or
	       shorter.	 1mNorthWest 22mspecifies that the top line of text on	the
	       screen  stay  fixed.   If the window is made shorter, lines are
	       dropped from the bottom; if the window is  made	taller,	 blank
	       lines  are  added  at  the bottom.  This is compatible with the
	       behavior in R4.	1mSouthWest 22m(the  default)  specifies  that	the
	       bottom line of text on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is
	       made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down  onto
	       the  screen;  if	 the  window  is  made	shorter, lines will be
	       scrolled off the top of the screen, and	the  top  saved	 lines
	       will be dropped.

       1mreverseVideo (22mclass 1mReverseVideo)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  reverse video should be simulated.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1mreverseWrap (22mclass 1mReverseWrap)0m
	       Specifies whether or not reverse-wraparound should be  enabled.
	       This  corresponds  to  4mxterm24m's private mode 45.  The default is
	       ``false.''

       1mrightScrollBar (22mclass 1mRightScrollBar)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be	 displayed  on
	       the right rather than the left.	The default is ``false.''

       1msaveLines (22mclass 1mSaveLines)0m
	       Specifies  the  number  of  lines to save beyond the top of the
	       screen when a scrollbar is turned on.  The default is 64.

       1mscrollBar (22mclass 1mScrollBar)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the  scrollbar	should	be  displayed.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1mscrollBarBorder (22mclass 1mScrollBarBorder)0m
	       Specifies the width of the scrollbar border.  Note that this is
	       drawn to overlap the border of the 4mxterm24m window.  Modifying the
	       scrollbar's  border  affects  only  the	line between the VT100
	       widget and the scrollbar.  The default value is 1.

       1mscrollKey (22mclass 1mScrollCond)0m
	       Specifies whether or not pressing a  key	 should	 automatically
	       cause  the  scrollbar  to  go  to  the  bottom of the scrolling
	       region.	This corresponds to 4mxterm24m's private  mode	1011.	The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mscrollLines (22mclass 1mScrollLines)0m
	       Specifies  the number of lines that the 4mscroll-back24m and 4mscroll-0m
	       4mforw24m actions should use as a default.  The default value is	 1.

       1mscrollTtyOutput (22mclass 1mScrollCond)0m
	       Specifies   whether  or	not  output  to	 the  terminal	should
	       automatically cause the scrollbar to go to the  bottom  of  the
	       scrolling region.  The default is ``true.''

       1mselectToClipboard (22mclass 1mSelectToClipboard)0m
	       Tells  4mxterm24m whether to use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for SELECT
	       tokens in the selection mechanism.  The 1mset-select  22maction	can
	       change this at runtime, allowing the user to work with programs
	       that handle only one  of	 these	mechanisms.   The  default  is
	       ``false'', which tells it to use PRIMARY.

       1mshiftFonts (22mclass 1mShiftFonts)0m
	       Specifies  whether  to  enable the actions 1mlarger-vt-font() 22mand
	       1msmaller-vt-font()22m, which are  normally  bound  to  the  shifted
	       KP_Add and KP_Subtract.	The default is ``true.''

       1mshowBlinkAsBold (22mclass 1mShowBlinkAsBold)0m
	       Tells  4mxterm24m  whether  to display text with blink-attribute the
	       same as bold.  If 4mxterm24m has	 not  been  configured	to  support
	       blinking	 text,	the default is ``true.'', which corresponds to
	       older versions of 4mxterm24m, otherwise the default is ``false.''

       1mshowMissingGlyphs (22mclass 1mShowMissingGlyphs)0m
	       Tells 4mxterm24m whether to display a box outlining places  where  a
	       character  has been used that the font does not represent.  The
	       default is ``false.''

       1msignalInhibit (22mclass 1mSignalInhibit)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the entries in	the  ``Main  Options''
	       menu  for  sending  signals to 4mxterm24m should be disallowed.	The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mtekGeometry (22mclass 1mGeometry)0m
	       Specifies the preferred size  and  position  of	the  Tektronix
	       window.	There is no default for this resource.

       1mtekInhibit (22mclass 1mTekInhibit)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the escape sequence to enter Tektronix
	       mode should be ignored.	The default is ``false.''

       1mtekSmall (22mclass 1mTekSmall)0m
	       Specifies whether or not the Tektronix mode window should start
	       in its smallest size if no explicit geometry is given.  This is
	       useful when running 4mxterm24m on displays with small screens.	The
	       default is ``false.''

       1mtekStartup (22mclass 1mTekStartup)0m
	       Specifies  whether  or  not  4mxterm24m should start up in Tektronix
	       mode.  The default is ``false.''

       1mtiXtraScroll (22mclass 1mTiXtraScroll)0m
	       Specifies whether 4mxterm24m  should  scroll  to	 a  new	 page  when
	       processing  the	4mti24m	 termcap entry, i.e., the private modes 47,
	       1047 or 1049.   This  is	 only  in  effect  if  1mtiteInhibit  22mis
	       ``true'',  because  the	intent	of this option is to provide a
	       picture	of  the	 full-screen  application's  display  on   the
	       scrollback  without  wiping  out	 the  text that would be shown
	       before the application was initialized.	The default  for  this
	       resource is ``false.''

       1mtiteInhibit (22mclass 1mTiteInhibit)0m
	       Specifies  whether or not 4mxterm24m should remove 4mti24m and 4mte24m termcap
	       entries (used to switch between alternate screens on startup of
	       many  screen-oriented  programs)	 from  the TERMCAP string.  If
	       set, 4mxterm24m also ignores the escape sequence to  switch  to	the
	       alternate  screen.  4mXterm24m supports terminfo in a different way,
	       supporting composite control sequences (also known  as  private
	       modes)  1047,  1048  and 1049 which have the same effect as the
	       original 47 control sequence.  The default for this resource is
	       ``false.''

       1mtranslations (22mclass 1mTranslations)0m
	       Specifies  the  key  and button bindings for menus, selections,
	       ``programmed strings,'' etc.  The 1mtranslations 22mresource,  which
	       provides much of 4mxterm24m's configurability, is a feature of the X
	       Toolkit Intrinsics library (Xt).	 See the 1mACTIONS 22msection.

       1mtrimSelection (22mclass 1mTrimSelection)0m
	       If you set 1mhighlightSelection22m, you can see the  text  which	 is
	       selected,  including  any trailing spaces.  Clearing the screen
	       (or a line) resets it to a state containing  no	spaces.	  Some
	       lines  may  contain  trailing spaces when an application writes
	       them to the screen.  However, you may not wish to  paste	 lines
	       with  trailing  spaces.	 If  this resource is true, 4mxterm24m will
	       trim trailing spaces from text which is selected.  It does  not
	       affect  spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it trim
	       the trailing newline  from  your	 selection.   The  default  is
	       ``false.''

       1munderLine (22mclass 1mUnderLine)0m
	       This specifies whether or not text with the underline attribute
	       should  be  underlined.	 It  may  be  desirable	  to   disable
	       underlining   when  color  is  being  used  for	the  underline
	       attribute.  The default is ``true.''

       1mutf8 (22mclass 1mUtf8)0m
	       This specifies whether 4mxterm24m will run in UTF-8  mode.   If	you
	       set  this resource, 4mxterm24m also sets the 1mwideChars 22mresource as a
	       side-effect.  The resource is an	 integer,  expected  to	 range
	       from 0 to 3:

	       0  UTF-8	 mode  is  initially off.  The command-line option 1m+u80m
		  sets the resource  to	 this  value.	Escape	sequences  for
		  turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

	       1  UTF-8	 mode  is  initially on.  Escape sequences for turning
		  UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

	       2  The command-line option 1m-u8 22msets the resource to this value.
		  Escape  sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are ignored.

	       3  This is the default value of the resource.   It  is  changed
		  during   initialization  depending  on  whether  the	1mlocale0m
		  resource was set, to 0 or 2.	See the	 1mlocale  22mresource	for
		  additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales.

	       If  you	want  to  set  the value of 1mutf822m, it should be in this
	       range.  Other nonzero values are treated	 the  same  as	``1'',
	       i.e.,  UTF-8  mode  is  initially  on, and escape sequences for
	       turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

       1mutf8Fonts (22mclass 1mUtf8Fonts)0m
	       See the discussion of the 1mlocale 22mresource.

       1mutf8Latin1 (22mclass 1mUtf8Latin1)0m
	       If true, allow an ISO-8859-1 4mnormal24m font to be combined with an
	       ISO-10646 font if the latter is given via the 1m-fw 22moption or its
	       corresponding resource value.  The default is ``false.''

       1mutf8Title (22mclass 1mUtf8Title)0m
	       Applications  can  set  4mxterm24m's  title  by	writing	 a  control
	       sequence.   Normally  this  control  sequence follows the VT220
	       convention, which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1  and	allows
	       for an 8-bit string terminator.	If 4mxterm24m is started in a UTF-8
	       locale, it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to  UTF-8  to  work
	       with the X libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.

	       However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in
	       UTF-8.  Set this resource to ``true'' to	 allow	UTF-8  encoded
	       title strings.  That cancels the translation to UTF-8, allowing
	       UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.

	       The default is ``false.''

       1mveryBoldColors (22mclass 1mVeryBoldColors)0m
	       Specifies whether  to  combine  video  attributes  with	colors
	       specified  by  1mcolorBD22m,  1mcolorBL22m,  1mcolorRV  22mand  1mcolorUL22m.   The
	       resource value is the sum of values for each attribute:
		 1 for reverse,
		 2 for underline,
		 4 for bold and
		 8 for blink.

	       The default is ``0.''

       1mvisualBell (22mclass 1mVisualBell)0m
	       Specifies whether or not a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should
	       be  used instead of an audible bell when Control-G is received.
	       The default is ``false.''

       1mvisualBellDelay (22mclass 1mVisualBellDelay)0m
	       Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual	 bell.
	       Default	is  100.  If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed.
	       This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display  on
	       a laptop.

       1mvt100Graphics (22mclass 1mVT100Graphics)0m
	       This  specifies	whether	 4mxterm24m  will  interpret  VT100 graphic
	       character escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode.	The default is
	       ``true'', to provide support for various legacy applications.

       1mwideBoldFont (22mclass 1mWideBoldFont)0m
	       This  option  specifies the font to be used for displaying bold
	       wide text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice  as
	       wide  as	 the  font that will be used to draw bold text.	 If no
	       doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the
	       bold font.

       1mwideChars (22mclass 1mWideChars)0m
	       Specifies  if  4mxterm24m  should  respond to control sequences that
	       process 16-bit characters.  The default is ``false.''

       1mwideFont (22mclass 1mWideFont)0m
	       This option specifies the font to be used for  displaying  wide
	       text.   By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide
	       as the font that will be used  to  draw	normal	text.	If  no
	       doublewidth font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the
	       normal font.

       1mximFont (22mclass 1mXimFont)0m
	       This option specifies the font to be used  for  displaying  the
	       preedit string in the "OverTheSpot" input method.

	       In  "OverTheSpot"  preedit  type,  the  preedit (preconversion)
	       string is displayed at the position of the cursor.  It  is  the
	       XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.  The
	       XIM client must inform the XIM server of the  cursor  position.
	       For  best  results, the preedit string must be displayed with a
	       proper font.  Therefore, 4mxterm24m informs the XIM  server  of	the
	       proper  font.   The  font  is be supplied by a "fontset", whose
	       default value is "*".  This matches every font, the  X  library
	       automatically  chooses fonts with proper charsets.  The 1mximFont0m
	       resource is provided to override this default font setting.

       The following resources are specified as part  of  the  4mtek401424m  widget
       (class	4mTek401424m).	  These	  are	specified   by	 patterns  such	 as
       "1mXTerm.tek4014.4m22mNAME24m":

       1mfont2 (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies font number 2 to use in the Tektronix window.

       1mfont3 (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies font number 3 to use in the Tektronix window.

       1mfontLarge (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies the large font to use in the Tektronix window.

       1mfontSmall (22mclass 1mFont)0m
	       Specifies the small font to use in the Tektronix window.

       1mginTerminator (22mclass 1mGinTerminator)0m
	       Specifies what character(s)  should  follow  a  GIN  report  or
	       status  report.	The possibilities are ``none,'' which sends no
	       terminating  characters,	 ``CRonly,''  which  sends   CR,   and
	       ``CR&EOT,''  which  sends  both	CR  and	 EOT.	The default is
	       ``none.''

       1mheight (22mclass 1mHeight)0m
	       Specifies the height of the Tektronix window in pixels.

       1minitialFont (22mclass 1mInitialFont)0m
	       Specifies which of the four Tektronix fonts to  use  initially.
	       Values  are  the	 same  as  for	the  4mset-tek-text24m action.	The
	       default is ``large.''

       1mwidth (22mclass 1mWidth)0m
	       Specifies the width of the Tektronix window in pixels.

       The resources that may be specified for the various menus are described
       in  the	documentation  for the Athena 1mSimpleMenu 22mwidget.  The name and
       classes of  the	entries	 in  each  of  the  menus  are	listed	below.
       Resources  named	 "1mline4m22mN24m" where 4mN24m is a number are separators with class
       1mSmeLine22m.

       The 4mmainMenu24m has the following entries:

       1mtoolbar (22mclass 1mSmeBSB)0m

       The following resources	are  useful  when  specified  for  the	Athena
       Scrollbar widget:

       1mthickness (22mclass 1mThickness)0m
	       Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar.

       1mbackground (22mclass 1mBackground)0m
	       Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.

       1mforeground (22mclass 1mForeground)0m
	       Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.
	       The ``thumb'' of the scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern
	       alternating pixels for foreground and background color.

1mPOINTER USAGE0m
       Once the VT102 window is created, 4mxterm24m allows you to select  text	and
       copy it within the same or other windows.

   1mSELECTION0m
       The  selection  functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used
       with no modifiers, and when they are used with the ``shift'' key.   The
       assignment  of the functions described below to keys and buttons may be
       changed through the resource database; see 1mACTIONS 22mbelow.

       Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save  text	into  the  cut
       buffer.	 Move  the  cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the
       button down while moving the cursor  to	the  end  of  the  region  and
       releasing the button.  The selected text is highlighted and is saved in
       the global cut buffer and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is
       released.  Normally (but see the discussion of 1mon2Clicks22m, etc):

	      -	 Double-clicking selects by words.

	      -	 Triple-clicking selects by lines.

	      -	 Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.

       Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to button down,
       so you can change the selection unit in	the  middle  of	 a  selection.
       Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap
       across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by 4mxterm24m  itself
       rather  than  by	 the  application  running  in	the  window.   If  the
       key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to  be  made,	 4mxterm0m
       will  leave  the	 selected  text	 highlighted  for as long as it is the
       selection owner.

       Pointer button two (usually middle) `types' (pastes) the text from  the
       PRIMARY	selection, if any, otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting it
       as keyboard input.

       Pointer button three (usually right)  extends  the  current  selection.
       (Without	 loss  of  generality,	you  can  swap	``right'' and ``left''
       everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.)  If pressed while closer  to
       the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the
       right edge of the selection.  If you contract the  selection  past  the
       left  edge  of  the  selection, 4mxterm24m assumes you really meant the left
       edge, restores the original selection, then extends/contracts the  left
       edge  of	 the  selection.   Extension starts in the selection unit mode
       that the	 last  selection  or  extension	 was  performed	 in;  you  can
       multiple-click to cycle through them.

       By  cutting  and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you
       can take text from several places  in  different	 windows  and  form  a
       command	to  the	 shell, for example, or take output from a program and
       insert it into your favorite editor.  Since cut	buffers	 are  globally
       shared  among  different	 applications, you may regard each as a `file'
       whose contents you know.	 The terminal emulator and other text programs
       should  be  treating  it	 as  if it were a text file, i.e., the text is
       delimited by new lines.

   1mSCROLLING0m
       The scroll region displays the position and amount  of  text  currently
       showing	in  the	 window	 (highlighted)	relative to the amount of text
       actually saved.	As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of
       the highlighted area decreases.

       Clicking	 button	 one  with  the pointer in the scroll region moves the
       adjacent line to the top of the display window.

       Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down  to
       the pointer position.

       Clicking	 button	 two moves the display to a position in the saved text
       that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar.

   1mTEKTRONIX POINTER0m
       Unlike the VT102 window,	 the  Tektronix	 window	 does  not  allow  the
       copying	of  text.   It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode
       the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.	 Pressing any key will
       send that key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing
       button one, two, or three will return the letters `l',  `m',  and  `r',
       respectively.   If  the `shift' key is pressed when a pointer button is
       pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is sent.  To distinguish a
       pointer	button	from  a key, the high bit of the character is set (but
       this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is  RAW;  see
       4mtty24m(4) for details).

1mMENUS0m
       4mXterm24m  has	four  menus, named 4mmainMenu24m, 4mvtMenu24m, 4mfontMenu24m, and 4mtekMenu24m.
       Each menu pops up under the correct  combinations  of  key  and	button
       presses.	 Each menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal
       line.  Some menu entries correspond to modes that can  be  altered.   A
       check  mark appears next to a mode that is currently active.  Selecting
       one of these modes toggles its state.  Other menu entries are commands;
       selecting one of these performs the indicated function.

       All  of	the  menu entries correspond to X actions.  In the list below,
       the menu label is shown followed by the action's name in parenthesis.

   1mMain Options0m
       The 4mxterm24m 4mmainMenu24m pops up when the ``control'' key and pointer  button
       one  are	 pressed  in a window.	This menu contains items that apply to
       both the VT102 and Tektronix windows.  There are several sections:

       Commands for managing X events:

	      Toolbar
		     Clicking on the "Toolbar" menu entry hides the toolbar if
		     it is visible, and shows it if it is not.

	      Secure Keyboard (securekbd)
		     The  1mSecure  Keyboard  22mmode  is  helpful  when  typing in
		     passwords	or  other  sensitive  data  in	 an   unsecure
		     environment; see 1mSECURITY 22mbelow (but read the limitations
		     carefully).

	      Allow SendEvents (allowsends )
		     Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button	events
		     generated	using  the X protocol SendEvent request should
		     be interpreted or discarded.   This  corresponds  to  the
		     1mallowSendEvents 22mresource.

	      Redraw Window (redraw)
		     Forces   the   X  display	to  repaint;  useful  in  some
		     environments.

       Commands for capturing output:

	      Log to File (logging)
		     Captures text sent to the screen in a logfile, as in  the
		     1m-l 22mlogging option.

	      Print Window (print)
		     Sends the text of the current window to the program given
		     in the 1mprinterCommand 22mresource.

	      Redirect to Printer (print-redir)
		     This sets the 1mprinterControlMode 22mto 0 or 2.  You can	use
		     this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
		     the appropriate control sequence.	It is also useful  for
		     switching	the  printer off if an application turns it on
		     without resetting the print control mode.

       Modes for setting keyboard style:

	      8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control)
		     Enabled for VT220 emulation, this controls whether	 4mxterm0m
		     will send 8-bit control sequences rather than using 7-bit
		     (ASCII) controls, e.g.,  sending  a  byte	in  the	 range
		     128-159  rather  than  the escape character followed by a
		     second byte.  4mXterm24m  always  interprets  both	 8-bit	and
		     7-bit  control  sequences (see the document 4mXterm24m 4mControl0m
		     4mSequences24m).	This  corresponds  to  the  1meightBitControl0m
		     resource.

	      Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow key)
		     Modifies  the  behavior  of  the backarrow key, making it
		     transmit  either  a  backspace  (8)   or	delete	 (127)
		     character.	   This	  corresponds	to   the  1mbackarrowKey0m
		     resource.

	      Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
		     Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers.
		     This corresponds to the 1mnumLock 22mresource.

	      Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc)
		     Controls  whether	4mMeta24m  keys	 are  converted into a two-
		     character sequence with the character itself preceded  by
		     ESC.  This corresponds to the 1mmetaSendsEscape 22mresource.

	      Delete is DEL (delete-is-del)
		     Controls  whether	the  Delete  key on the editing keypad
		     should send DEL (127) or the  VT220-style	Remove	escape
		     sequence.	 This corresponds to the 1mdeleteIsDEL 22mresource.

	      Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys)

	      HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys)

	      SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys)

	      Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)

	      VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard)
		     These act as a radio-button, selecting one style for  the
		     keyboard	layout.	  It  corresponds  to  more  than  one
		     resource	 setting:    1msunKeyboard22m,	   1msunFunctionKeys22m,
		     1mscoFunctionKeys 22mand 1mhpFunctionKeys 22m."

       Commands for process signalling:

	      Send STOP Signal (suspend)

	      Send CONT Signal (continue)

	      Send INT Signal (interrupt)

	      Send HUP Signal (hangup)

	      Send TERM Signal (terminate)

	      Send KILL Signal (kill)
		     These  send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM
		     and SIGKILL signals respectively, to the process group of
		     the process running under 4mxterm24m (usually the shell).	The
		     1mSIGCONT 22mfunction is especially useful	 if  the  user	has
		     accidentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending the process.

	      Quit (quit)
		     Stop  processing  X  events  except  to support the 1m-hold0m
		     option, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the the  process
		     group  of	the  process  running under 4mxterm24m (usually the
		     shell).


   1mVT Options0m
       The 4mvtMenu24m sets various modes in the VT102 emulation, and is popped	 up
       when  the  ``control''  key  and	 pointer button two are pressed in the
       VT102 window.

       VT102/VT220 Modes:

	      Enable Scrollbar (scrollbar)
		     Enable (or disable) the scrollbar.	 This  corresponds  to
		     the 1m-sb 22moption and the 1mscrollBar 22mresource.

	      Enable Jump Scroll (jumpscroll)
		     Enable  (or disable) jump scrolling.  This corresponds to
		     the 1m-j 22moption and the 1mjumpScroll 22mresource.

	      Enable Reverse Video (reversevideo)
		     Enable (or disable) reverse-video.	 This  corresponds  to
		     the 1m-rv 22moption and the 1mreverseVideo 22mresource.

	      Enable Auto Wraparound (autowrap)
		     Enable (or disable) auto-wraparound.  This corresponds to
		     the 1m-aw 22moption and the 1mautoWrap 22mresource.

	      Enable Reverse Wraparound (reversewrap)
		     Enable (or disable) reverse wraparound.  This corresponds
		     to the 1m-rw 22moption and the 1mreverseWrap 22mresource.

	      Enable Auto Linefeed (autolinefeed)
		     Enable (or disable) auto-linefeed.	 This is the VT102 NEL
		     function, which causes the emulator to  emit  a  linefeed
		     after  each  carriage  return.  There is no corresponding
		     command-line option or resource setting.

	      Enable Application Cursor Keys (appcursor)
		     Enable  (or  disable)  application	 cursor	 keys.	  This
		     corresponds  to  the 1mappcursorDefault 22mresource.  There is
		     no corresponding command-line option.

	      Enable Application Keypad (appkeypad)
		     Enable  (or  disable)  application	 keypad	 keys.	  This
		     corresponds  to  the 1mappkeypadDefault 22mresource.  There is
		     no corresponding command-line option.

	      Scroll to Bottom on Key Press (scrollkey)
		     Enable (or	 disable)  scrolling  to  the  bottom  of  the
		     scrolling	region on a keypress.  This corresponds to the
		     1m-sk 22moption and the 1mscrollKey 22mresource.

	      Scroll to Bottom on Tty Output (scrollttyoutput)
		     Enable (or	 disable)  scrolling  to  the  bottom  of  the
		     scrolling	region	on  output  to	the  terminal..	  This
		     corresponds to the 1m-si  22moption  and  the  1mscrollTtyOutput0m
		     resource.

	      Allow 80/132 Column Switching (allow132)
		     Enable (or disable) switching between 80 and 132 columns.
		     This  corresponds	to  the	 1m-132	 22moption  and	 the   1mc1320m
		     resource.

	      Select to Clipboard (selectToClipboard)
		     Tell  4mxterm24m  whether	to use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for
		     SELECT tokens in the  1mtranslations  22mresource	which  maps
		     keyboard and mouse actions to select/paste actions.  This
		     corresponds to the 1mselectToClipboard 22mresource.  There	 is
		     no corresponding command-line option.

	      Enable Visual Bell (visualbell)
		     Enable (or disable) visible bell (i.e., flashing) instead
		     of an audible bell.  This corresponds to the  1m-vb  22moption
		     and the 1mvisualBell 22mresource.

	      Enable Pop on Bell (poponbell)
		     Enable  (or disable) raising of the window when Control-G
		     is received.  This corresponds to the 1m-pop 22moption and the
		     1mpopOnBell 22mresource.

	      Enable Margin Bell (marginbell)
		     Enable  (or  disable) a bell when the user types near the
		     right margin.  This corresponds to the 1m-mb 22moption and the
		     1mmarginBell 22mresource.

	      Enable Blinking Cursor (cursorblink)
		     Enable  (or  disable)  the blinking-cursor feature.  This
		     corresponds  to  the  1m-bc  22moption  and  the	1mcursorBlink0m
		     resource.	 There	is  also  an  escape sequence (see the
		     document 4mXterm24m 4mControl24m 4mSequences24m).	The  menu  entry  and
		     the  escape  sequence  states  are	 XOR'd:	 if  both  are
		     enabled, the cursor  will	not  blink,  if	 only  one  is
		     enabled, the cursor will blink.

	      Enable Alternate Screen Switching (titeInhibit)
		     Enable  (or  disable)  switching  between	the normal and
		     alternate screens.	 This corresponds to  the  1mtiteInhibit0m
		     resource.	There is no corresponding command-line option.

	      Enable Active Icon (activeicon)
		     Enable  (or  disable)  the	 active-icon  feature.	  This
		     corresponds   to	the  1m-ai  22moption  and  the	 1mactiveIcon0m
		     resource.

       VT102/VT220 Commands:

	      Do Soft Reset (softreset)
		     Reset scroll regions.  This can be convenient  when  some
		     program  has  left	 the  scroll  regions  set incorrectly
		     (often a  problem	when  using  VMS  or  TOPS-20).	  This
		     corresponds to the VT220 DECSTR control sequence.

	      Do Full Reset (hardreset)
		     The full reset entry will clear the screen, reset tabs to
		     every eight columns, and reset the terminal  modes	 (such
		     as	 wrap  and smooth scroll) to their initial states just
		     after 4mxterm24m has  finished  processing	 the  command  line
		     options.	This  corresponds  to  the  VT102  RIS control
		     sequence, with a few obvious differences.	 For  example,
		     your  session  is	not disconnected as a real VT102 would
		     do.

	      Reset and Clear Saved Lines (clearsavedlines)
		     Perform a full reset, and also clear the saved lines.

       Commands for setting the current screen:

	      Show Tek Window (tekshow)
		     When enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up (makes it
		     visible).	  When	disabled,  hides  the  Tektronix  4014
		     window.

	      Switch to Tek Mode (tekmode)
		     When enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up if it  is
		     not  already  visible,  and  switches the input stream to
		     that window.  When disabled,  hides  the  Tektronix  4014
		     window and switches input back to the VTxxx window.

	      Hide VT Window (vthide)
		     When enabled, hides the VTxxx window, shows the Tektronix
		     4014 window if it was not already	visible	 and  switches
		     the  input	 stream	 to that window.  When disabled, shows
		     the VTxxx window, and switches the input stream  to  that
		     window.

	      Show Alternate Screen (altscreen)
		     When enabled, shows the alternate screen.	When disabled,
		     shows the normal screen.  Note that the normal screen may
		     have saved lines; the alternate screen does not.


   1mVT Fonts0m
       The  4mfontMenu24m  pops up when when the ``control'' key and pointer button
       three are pressed in a window.  It sets the  font  used	in  the	 VT102
       window,	or modifies the way the font is specified or displayed.	 There
       are three sections.

       The first section  allows  you  to  select  the	font  from  a  set  of
       alternatives:

	      Default (fontdefault)
		     Set  the  font  to	 the  default, i.e., that given by the
		     1m*VT100.font 22mresource.

	      Unreadable (font1)
		     Set the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font1  22mresource.

	      Tiny (font2)
		     Set  the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font2 22mresource.

	      Small (font3)
		     Set the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font3  22mresource.

	      Medium (font4)
		     Set  the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font4 22mresource.

	      Large (font5)
		     Set the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font5  22mresource.

	      Huge (font6)
		     Set  the font to that given by the 1m*VT100.font6 22mresource.

	      Escape Sequence
		     This allows you to set the font last specified by the Set
		     Font  escape  sequence  (see  the	document 4mXterm24m 4mControl0m
		     4mSequences24m).

	      Selection (fontsel)
		     This allows you to set the	 font  specified  the  current
		     selection	as  a  font  name (if the PRIMARY selection is
		     owned).

       The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:

	      Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing)
		     When set,	tells  4mxterm24m  to  draw  its  own  line-drawing
		     characters.   Otherwise  it relies on the font containing
		     these.  Compare to the 1mforceBoxChars 22mresource.

	      Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize)
		     When set, 4mxterm24m may ask the font server to produce scaled
		     versions  of  the	normal	font,  for  VT102  double-size
		     characters.

       The third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:

	      TrueType Fonts (render-font)
		     If the 1mrenderFont 22mand corresponding resources	 were  set,
		     this is a further control whether 4mxterm24m will actually use
		     the Xft library calls to obtain a font.

	      UTF-8 (utf8-mode)
		     This  controls  whether  4mxterm24m  uses	UTF-8  encoding	 of
		     input/output.   It	 is  useful  for temporarily switching
		     4mxterm24m to display text from an application which does	not
		     follow the locale settings.

   1mTEK Options0m
       The  4mtekMenu24m  sets	various	 modes	in  the Tektronix emulation, and is
       popped up when the ``control'' key and pointer button two  are  pressed
       in the Tektronix window.	 The current font size is checked in the modes
       section of the menu.

	      Large Characters (tektextlarge)

	      #2 Size Characters (tektext2)

	      #3 Size Characters (tektext3)

	      Small Characters (tektextsmall)

       Commands:

	      PAGE (tekpage)
		     Clear the Tektronix window.

	      RESET (tekreset)

	      COPY (tekcopy)

       Windows:

	      Show VT Window (vtshow)

	      Switch to VT Mode (vtmode)

	      Hide Tek Window (tekhide)

1mSECURITY0m
       X environments differ in their security consciousness.	Most  servers,
       run  under  4mxdm24m,  are capable of using a ``magic cookie'' authorization
       scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people.
       If  your	 server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access
       to the server (see 4mxhost(1)24m), then if you enable access for a host	and
       other  users are also permitted to run clients on that same host, it is
       possible that someone can run  an  application  which  uses  the	 basic
       services	 of  the  X  protocol to snoop on your activities, potentially
       capturing a transcript of everything you type  at  the  keyboard.   Any
       process	which  has  access to your X display can manipulate it in ways
       that you might not anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard to itself
       and  sending  events  to your application's windows.  This is true even
       with  the   ``magic   cookie''	authorization	scheme.	   While   the
       1mallowSendEvents  22mprovides  some  protection	 against rogue applications
       tampering with your programs, guarding against a snooper is harder.

       The possibility of an application  spying  on  your  keystrokes	is  of
       particular  concern  when  you  want  to	 type  in  a password or other
       sensitive data.	The best solution to this problem is to use  a	better
       authorization  mechanism	 than  is  provided  by X.  Given all of these
       caveats, a simple mechanism exists for  protecting  keyboard  input  in
       4mxterm24m.

       The  4mxterm24m	menu  (see  1mMENUS  22mabove)	contains a 1mSecure Keyboard 22mentry
       which, when enabled, attempts to ensure	that  all  keyboard  input  is
       directed 4monly24m to 4mxterm24m (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).  When
       an application prompts you for a password (or  other  sensitive	data),
       you  can	 enable	 1mSecure Keyboard 22musing the menu, type in the data, and
       then disable 1mSecure Keyboard 22musing the menu again.	This  ensures  that
       you  know  which window is accepting your keystrokes.  It cannot ensure
       that there are no processes which have access to your  X	 display  that
       might be observing the keystrokes as well.

       Only  one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt
       to enable 1mSecure Keyboard 22mit may fail.  In this  case,  the	 bell  will
       sound.	If the 1mSecure Keyboard 22msucceeds, the foreground and background
       colors will be exchanged (as if you selected the 1mReverse Video 22mentry in
       the  1mModes  22mmenu);	they  will  be exchanged again when you exit secure
       mode.  If the colors do 4mnot24m switch, then you should be 4mvery24m  suspicious
       that  you  are  being  spoofed.	 If  the  application  you are running
       displays a prompt before asking for the password, it is safest to enter
       secure mode 4mbefore24m the prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the
       prompt gets displayed correctly (in the new colors),  to	 minimize  the
       probability of spoofing.	 You can also bring up the menu again and make
       sure that a check mark appears next to the entry.

       1mSecure Keyboard 22mmode will  be  disabled  automatically  if	your  4mxterm0m
       window  becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up a
       reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
       around  the  window) while in 1mSecure Keyboard 22mmode.	 (This is a feature
       of the X	 protocol  not	easily	overcome.)   When  this	 happens,  the
       foreground  and	background  colors  will be switched back and the bell
       will sound in warning.

1mCHARACTER CLASSES0m
       Clicking the left mouse	button	twice  in  rapid  succession  (double-
       clicking) causes all characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white
       space, punctuation) to be selected  as  a  ``word''.   Since  different
       people  have  different	preferences  for  what should be selected (for
       example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only	 the  separate
       subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use of the
       1mcharClass 22m(class 4mCharClass24m) resource.

       This resource is a series of comma-separated of 4mrange24m:4mvalue24m pairs.  The
       4mrange24m is either a single number or 4mlow24m-4mhigh24m in the range of 0 to 65535,
       corresponding to the code for the character or characters  to  be  set.
       The  4mvalue24m	is arbitrary, although the default table uses the character
       number of the first character occurring in the set.  When not in	 UTF-8
       mode, only the first 256 bytes of this table will be used.

       The default table starts as follows -

	   static int charClass[256] = {
	   /* NUL  SOH	STX  ETX  EOT  ENQ  ACK	 BEL */

       For  example,  the string ``33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48'' indicates that
       the exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash, and  ampersand
       characters  should  be  treated the same way as characters and numbers.
       This is useful for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and
       filenames.

1mACTIONS0m
       It  is  possible	 to  rebind  keys  (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary
       strings for input, by changing the 1mtranslations 22mresources for the vt100
       or  tek4014  widgets.   Changing	 the  1mtranslations 22mresource for events
       other than key and button  events  is  not  expected,  and  will	 cause
       unpredictable  behavior.	  The  following  actions are provided for use
       within the 4mvt10024m or 4mtek401424m 1mtranslations 22mresources:

       1mallow-send-events(4m22mon/off/toggle24m1m)0m
	       This action set or toggles the 1mallowSendEvents 22mresource and	 is
	       also invoked by the 1mallowsends 22mentry in 4mmainMenu24m.

	       This action toggles the state of the 1meightBitInput 22mresource.

       1mbell([4m22mpercent24m1m])0m
	       This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage
	       above or below the base volume.

       1mclear-saved-lines()0m
	       This action does 1mhard-reset() 22m(see below) and also	clears	the
	       history	of  lines saved off the top of the screen.  It is also
	       invoked from the 1mclearsavedlines 22mentry in 4mvtMenu24m.   The  effect
	       is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.

       1mcreate-menu(4m22mm/v/f/t24m1m)0m
	       This  action  creates one of the menus used by 4mxterm24m, if it has
	       not been previously created.  The parameter values are the menu
	       names: 4mmainMenu24m, 4mvtMenu24m, 4mfontMenu24m, 4mtekMenu24m, respectively.

       1mdabbrev-expand()0m
	       Expands	the  word  before cursor by searching in the preceding
	       text on the screen and  in  the	scrollback  buffer  for	 words
	       starting	 with  that  abbreviation.  Repeating 1mdabbrev-expand()0m
	       several times in sequence searches for an alternative expansion
	       by looking farther back.	 Lack of more matches is signaled by a
	       1mbeep()22m.  Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is
	       preceded	 by  a	space)	yield successively all previous words.
	       Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.  The word here is
	       defined	as  a  sequence	 of  non-whitespace  characters.  This
	       feature	 partially   emulates	the   behavior	 of   `dynamic
	       abbreviation' expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/).  Here is
	       a resource setting for 4mxterm24m which will do the same thing:

		   *VT100*translations:	   #override \n\
			Meta <KeyPress> /:dabbrev-expand()


       1mdeiconify()0m
	       Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.

       1mdelete-is-del()0m
	       This action toggles the state of the 1mdeleteIsDEL 22mresource.

       1mdired-button()0m
	       Handles a button	 event	(other	than  press  and  release)  by
	       echoing	the event's position (i.e., character line and column)
	       in the following format:

		       ^X ESC G <line+' '> <col+' '>

       1miconify()0m
	       Iconifies the window.

       1mhard-reset()0m
	       This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and
	       cursor keys and clears the screen.  It is also invoked from the
	       1mhardreset 22mentry in 4mvtMenu24m.

       1mignore()0m
	       This action ignores the event but checks	 for  special  pointer
	       position escape sequences.

       1minsert()0m
	       This action inserts the character or string associated with the
	       key that was pressed.

       1minsert-eight-bit()0m
	       This  action  inserts  an  eight-bit  (Meta)  version  of   the
	       character  or  string associated with the key that was pressed.
	       This only applies to  single-byte  values.   The	 exact	action
	       depends	 on   the   value   of	the  1mmetaSendsEscape	22mand	the
	       1meightBitInput	22mresources.	The  1mmetaSendsEscape	22mresource   is
	       tested first.

	       The  term  "eight-bit" is misleading: 4mxterm24m checks if the key's
	       value is less than 128.	If so, 4mxterm24m adds 128  to	the  value,
	       setting	its  eighth  bit.   Otherwise  4mxterm24m sends an ESC byte
	       before the key.	In other applications' documentation, that  is
	       referred to as a "meta key".

       1minsert-selection(4m22msourcename24m 1m[, ...])0m
	       This  action  inserts  the  string  found  in  the selection or
	       cutbuffer indicated by 4msourcename24m.	Sources are checked in	the
	       order   given   (case  is  significant)	until  one  is	found.
	       Commonly-used  selections  include:  4mPRIMARY24m,  4mSECONDARY24m,   and
	       4mCLIPBOARD24m.	Cut buffers are typically named 4mCUT_BUFFER024m through
	       4mCUT_BUFFER724m.

       1minsert-seven-bit()0m
	       This action is a synonym for 1minsert() 22mThe term  "seven-bit"	 is
	       misleading:  it only implies that 4mxterm24m does not try to add 128
	       to the key's value as in 1minsert-eight-bit()22m.

       1minterpret(4m22mcontrol-sequence24m1m)0m
	       Interpret the given control  sequence  locally,	i.e.,  without
	       passing	it  to	the host.  This works by inserting the control
	       sequence at the front of the input buffer.  Use "\"  to	escape
	       octal  digits  in  the  string.	Xt does not allow you to put a
	       null character (i.e., "\000") in the string.

       1mkeymap(4m22mname24m1m)0m
	       This action dynamically defines a new translation  table	 whose
	       resource	  name	is  4mname24m  with  the  suffix  4mKeymap24m  (case  is
	       significant).  The name 4mNone24m restores the original	translation
	       table.

       1mlarger-vt-font()0m
	       Set  the	 font  to  the	next  larger  one,  based  on the font
	       dimensions.  See also 1mset-vt-font()22m.

       1mload-vt-fonts(4m22mname24m1m[,4m22mclass24m1m])0m
	       Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class.  That
	       is, load the "*VT100.4mname24m.font", resource as "*VT100.font" etc.
	       If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.

	       Unlike  1mset-vt-font()22m,  this  does	not  affect the escape- and
	       select-fonts, since those are not based on resource values.  It
	       does  affect  the fonts loosely organized under the ``Default''
	       menu entry: 1mfont22m, 1mboldFont22m, 1mwideFont 22mand 1mwideBoldFont22m.

       1mmaximize()0m
	       Resizes the window to fill the screen.

	       This action toggles the state of the 1mmetaSendsEscape  22mresource.

       1mpopup-menu(4m22mmenuname24m1m)0m
	       This  action  displays  the  specified popup menu.  Valid names
	       (case is significant) include:  4mmainMenu24m, 4mvtMenu24m, 4mfontMenu24m, and
	       4mtekMenu24m.

       1mprint() 22mThis  action prints the window and is also invoked by the 4mprint0m
	       entry in 4mmainMenu24m.

       1mprint-redir()0m
	       This action toggles the 1mprinterControlMode  22mbetween	 0  and	 2.
	       The  corresponding popup menu entry is useful for switching the
	       printer off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to
	       print random binary files on the terminal.

       1mquit()	 22mThis  action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.  It is
	       also invoked by the 1mquit 22mentry in 4mmainMenu24m.

       1mredraw()0m
	       This action redraws the window  and  is	also  invoked  by  the
	       4mredraw24m entry in 4mmainMenu24m.

       1mrestore()0m
	       Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.

	       This  action scrolls the text window backward so that text that
	       had previously scrolled off  the	 top  of  the  screen  is  now
	       visible.

	       The  4mcount24m argument indicates the number of 4munits24m (which may be
	       4mpage24m, 4mhalfpage24m, 4mpixel24m, or 4mline24m) by which to scroll.

	       An adjustment can be specified for these values by appending  a
	       "+" or "-" sign followed by a number, e.g., 4mpage-224m to specify 2
	       lines less than a page.

	       If the third parameter 4mmouse24m is given, the	action	is  ignored
	       when mouse reporting is enabled.

       1mscroll-forw(4m22mcount24m 1m[,4m22munits24m 1m[,4m22mmouse24m1m] ])0m
	       This action is similar to 1mscroll-back 22mexcept that it scrolls in
	       the other direction.

	       selection, without affecting the selection mode.

       1mselect-start()0m
	       This  action  begins  text  selection  at  the  current pointer
	       location.  See the section on 1mPOINTER USAGE 22mfor information	 on

	       VT102 window.  The first argument is a  single  character  that
	       specifies the font to be used:

	       4md24m  or 4mD24m indicate the default font (the font initially used when
		      4mxterm24m was started),

	       4m124m through 4m624m indicate the fonts specified by the  4mfont124m  through
		      4mfont624m resources,

	       4me24m  or  4mE24m  indicate the normal and bold fonts that have been set
		      through escape codes (or specified  as  the  second  and
		      third action arguments, respectively), and

	       4ms24m or 4mS24m indicate the font selection (as made by programs such as
		      4mxfontsel(1)24m) indicated by the second action argument.

	       If  4mxterm24m  is  configured  to  support  wide   characters,	 an
	       additional  two	optional  parameters  are recognized for the 4me0m
	       argument: wide font and wide bold font.

       1msmaller-vt-font()0m
	       Set the font to	the  next  smaller  one,  based	 on  the  font
	       dimensions.  See also 1mset-vt-font()22m.

       1msoft-reset()0m
	       This  action  resets  the  scrolling region and is also invoked
	       from the 1msoftreset 22mentry in 4mvtMenu24m.  The effect is identical to
	       a soft reset (DECSTR) control sequence.

       1mstart-extend()0m
	       This   action  is  similar  to  1mselect-start  22mexcept  that	the
	       selection is extended to the current pointer location.

       1mstart-cursor-extend()0m
	       This  action  is	 similar  to  1mselect-extend  22mexcept  that	the
	       selection is extended to the current text cursor position.

       1mstring(4m22mstring24m1m)0m
	       This action inserts the specified text string as if it had been
	       typed.	Quotation  is  necessary  if   the   string   contains
	       whitespace  or  non-alphanumeric	 characters.   If  the	string
	       argument begins with the characters ``0x'', it  is  interpreted
	       as a hex character constant.

       1mtek-copy()0m
	       This  action  copies  the  escape  codes	 used  to generate the
	       current window contents to a  file  in  the  current  directory
	       beginning  with	the  name  COPY.   It is also invoked from the
	       4mtekcopy24m entry in 4mtekMenu24m.

       1mtek-page()0m
	       This action clears the Tektronix window and is also invoked  by
	       the 1mtekpage 22mentry in 4mtekMenu24m.

       1mtek-reset()0m
	       This  action resets the Tektronix window and is also invoked by
	       the 4mtekreset24m entry in 4mtekMenu24m.

       1mvi-button()0m
	       Handles a button	 event	(other	than  press  and  release)  by
	       echoing	a  control  sequence  computed	from  the event's line
	       number in the screen relative to the current line:

		       ESC ^P
	       or
		       ESC ^N

	       according to whether the event is before, or after the  current
	       line,  respectively.   The ^N (or ^P) is repeated once for each
	       line that the event differs from the current line.  The control
	       sequence	 is  omitted  altogether if the button event is on the
	       current line.

       1mvisual-bell()0m
	       This action flashes the window quickly.

       The Tektronix window also has the following action:

       1mgin-press(4m22ml/L/m/M/r/R24m1m)0m
	       This action sends the indicated graphics input code.

       The default bindings in the VT102 window use the SELECT token, which is
       set by the 1mselectToClipboard 22mresource:

       Here  is	 an  example  which  uses  shifted select/paste to copy to the
       clipboard, and unshifted select/paste for the  primary  selection.   In
       each  case,  a (different) cut buffer is also a target or source of the
       select/paste operation.	It is important to remember however, that  cut
       buffers	store  data in ISO-8859-1 encoding, while selections can store
       data in a variety of formats  and  encodings.   While  4mxterm24m  owns	the
       selection,  it  highlights it.  When it loses the selection, it removes
       the  corresponding  highlight.	But  you  can  still  paste  from  the
       corresponding cut buffer.

	   *VT100*translations:	   #override \n\
	       ~Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
	       Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) \n\
	       ~Shift<BtnUp>:	    select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
	       Shift<BtnUp>:	    select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)


       Below  is  a  sample  how of the 1mkeymap() 22maction is used to add special
       keys for entering commonly-typed works:

	   *VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
	   *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
		<Key>F14: keymap(None) \n\
		<Key>F17: string("next") string(0x0d) \n\
		<Key>F18: string("step") string(0x0d) \n\
		<Key>F19: string("continue") string(0x0d) \n\
		<Key>F20: string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)


1mCONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD0m
       The 4mXterm24m 4mControl24m 4mSequences24m document lists the control sequences	which
       an  application	can  send 4mxterm24m to make it perform various operations.
       Most of these operations are  standardized,  from  either  the  DEC  or
       Tektronix  terminals,  or  from	more widely used standards such as ISO
       6429.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       4mXterm24m sets several environment variables:

       DISPLAY
	    is the display name, pointing to the X server (see	1mDISPLAY  NAMES0m
	    in X(7)).

       TERM is	set  according	to the termcap (or terminfo) entry which it is
	    using as a reference.

       WINDOWID
	    is set to the X window id number of the 4mxterm24m window.

       XTERM_SHELL
	    is set to the pathname of the program which is  invoked.   Usually
	    that  is  a	 shell	program,  e.g.,	 1m/bin/sh22m.	 Since	it  is	not
	    necessarily	 a  shell  program  however,  it  is   distinct	  from
	    ``SHELL''.

       XTERM_VERSION
	    is	set  to	 the string displayed by the 1m-version 22moption.  That is
	    normally an identifier for the X Window libraries  used  to	 build
	    4mxterm24m, followed by 4mxterm24m's patch number in parenthesis.  The patch
	    number is  also  part  of  the  response  to  a  Secondary	Device
	    Attributes (DA) control sequence (see 4mXterm24m 4mControl24m 4mSequences24m).

       Depending  on  your  system  configuration,  4mxterm24m	may  also  set	the
       following:

       COLUMNS
	    the width of the 4mxterm24m in characters (cf: "stty columns").

       HOME when 4mxterm24m is configured to update utmp.

       LINES
	    the height of the 4mxterm24m in characters (cf: "stty rows").

       LOGNAME
	    when 4mxterm24m is configured to update utmp.

       SHELL
	    when 4mxterm24m is configured to update utmp.  It is also  set  if	you
	    provide the shell name as the optional parameter.

       TERMCAP
	    the	 contents  of  the  termcap entry corresponding to $TERM, with
	    lines and columns values substituted for the  actual  size	window
	    you have created.

       TERMINFO
	    may	 be defined to a nonstandard location in the configure script.

1mFILES0m
       The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.

       4m/etc/utmp0m
	    the system logfile, which records user logins.

       4m/etc/wtmp0m
	    the system logfile, which records user logins and logouts.

       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm0m
	    the 4mxterm24m default application resources.

       4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color0m
	    the 4mxterm24m color application resources.	 If your  display  supports
	    color, use this
		      *customization: -color
	    in	your  .Xdefaults  file to automatically use this resource file
	    rather than 4m/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm24m.  If you do	not
	    do	this, 4mxterm24m uses its compiled-in default resource settings for
	    colors.

1mERROR MESSAGES0m
       Most of the fatal error messages from 4mxterm24m use the following format:
	      xterm: Error 4mXXX24m, errno 4mYYY24m: 4mZZZ0m
       The 4mXXX24m codes (which are used by 4mxterm24m as  its	 exit-code)  are  listed
       below, with a brief explanation.

1mBUGS0m
       Large pastes do not work on some systems.  This is not a bug in	4mxterm24m;
       it  is  a  bug  in  the pseudo terminal driver of those systems.	 4mxterm0m
       feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty will accept data,
       but  some  pty  drivers do not return enough information to know if the
       write has succeeded.

       Many of the options are not resettable after 4mxterm24m starts.

       This program still needs to be rewritten.  It should be split into very
       modular	sections, with the various emulators being completely separate
       widgets that do not know about each other.  Ideally, you'd like	to  be
       able  to	 pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single
       control widget.

       There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry  of  the  Tek  COPY  file
       name.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       These  commands	are  1mSAMPLE  CLIENTS	22mprovided with the XTrap X Server
       Extension Sources, Version 3.3.	XTrap is an X Server  extension	 which
       facilitates  the	 capturing  of	server	protocol and synthesizing core
       input events.  Information on how to obtain these sources can be	 found
       in the SOURCES section below.

       The  1mxtrapreset  22mcommand is the simplest XTrap client in that it merely
       performs an XQueryExtension()  against  XTrap.	The  name  "reset"  is
       historical.   The  4mdisplay24m	argument  is  parsed  by  the X Toolkit and
       specifies the display where XTrap is to be loaded; see X(1).

       1mxtrapinfo 22mdisplays general configuration information as a result of	 an
       GetAvailable  XTrap  request  to	 the  specified	 server.  It is simply
       designed to test the request/response mechanism of the XTrap  extension
       and  client  library  as	 well as display the configuration information
       that it finds.

       1mxtrapstats  22mtests  the  event  and	request	 vectoring  of	the  server
       extension  by configuring XTrap to collect usage statistics on all core
       input events and requests.  It has a primitive  command-line  interface
       for  showing  the  counters, zeroing out the counters, and quitting the
       program.

       1mxtrapout 22mtests the output transport from the  XTrap	 extension  to	the
       XTrap  client  library.	As an aside, since xtrapout has the capability
       of "recording" events and requests it receives, 1mxtrapout 22mis	 ideal	for
       providing input to test 1mxtrapin.  22mSince events are the only concern for
       the input transport, the -e flag can be specified to indicate that  all
       input  events (and only events) should be recorded by 1mxtrapout.  4m22mscript0m
       is specified primarily for non-U*IX machines which  don't  support  I/O
       re-direction  easily.   The  -v	flag is used to force recording of all
       requests and input events.

       1mxtrapin 22mis used to	test  the  input  transport  to	 the  XTrap  server
       extension.   As	stated earlier, it's input can be provided by 1mxtrapout0m
       using the -e qualifier.	While it's primary  function  is  for  testing
       XTrap  and  serving  as	an  example  for  XTrap	 functionality, it can
       reasonably used as a primitive "playback" client for X sessions.

       1mxtrapchar 22mparses ANSI character sequences including application program
       sequences  to  synthesize  input	 events	 to X Window servers using the
       XTrap server extension.	The intent of this program is to  serve	 as  a
       sample implementation for interfacing character-based alternative input
       sources into X servers  (e.g.   voice  recognition  systems).   Another
       application  might  be  "remote	keyboards".   The  -v  flag causes the
       program	to  display  XTrap  configuration   information	  and	echo's
       characters  processed  to  stdout.   If present, this must be the first
       argument.

       Note: 1mxtrapchar 22mhas only been used with Digital Workstations using	the
       LK201  compatible  keyboard.   Though  reasonable  effort  was  done to
       maintain portability,  no claims are made as to the  current  level  of
       portability to non-DEC servers for this program.

       The  1mxtrapproto 22mcommand is a regression test designed to test the basic
       XTrap protocol between a client and server.  If a given	implementation
       is  suspect,  the  results  of  this  test  should  be sent to an XTrap
       implementor and/or developer.

	    known as the RECORD extension (XTrap input synthesis functionality is
	    currently covered by the XTEST extension).	It is strongly suggested
	    that users of XTrap technology begin developing against RECORD/XTEST
	    as it is the intention of the X Consortium to drive these two extensions
	    in the standards process for providing the protocol capturing/synthesis
	    functionality.  Some members of the xtest working group are actively
	    researching migration issues between XTrap and RECORD.  If you'd like

1mNAME0m
       xvidtune - video mode tuner for XFree86

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxvidtune 22m[ 1m-show 22m| 1m-prev 22m| 1m-next 22m| 1m-unlock 22m] [ 4m-toolkitoption24m ... ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Xvidtune is a client interface to  the  XFree86	X  server  video  mode
       extension (XFree86-VidModeExtension).

       When  given one of the non-toolkit options, xvidtune provides a command
       line interface to either switch the video mode.

       Without any options (or with only toolkit options) it presents the user
       with  various  buttons  and  sliders  that can be used to interactively
       adjust existing video modes.  It will also  print  the  settings	 in  a
       format suitable for inclusion in an XF86Config file.

       Normally	 the  XFree86 X servers only allow changes to be made with the
       XFree86-VidModeExtension from clients connected via a local  connection
       type.

       Note:   The  original mode settings can be restored by pressing the `R'
       key, and this can be used to restore  a	stable	screen	in  situations
       where the screen becomes unreadable.

       The available buttons are:

       1mLeft0m
       1mRight0m
       1mUp0m
       1mDown0m
		 Adjust	 the  video  mode so that the display will be moved in
		 the appropriate direction.

       1mWider0m
       1mNarrower0m
       1mShorter0m
       1mTaller0m
		 Adjust the video mode so that the  display  size  is  altered
		 appropriately.

       1mQuit	   22mExit the program.

       1mApply	   22mAdjust the current video mode to match the selected settings.

       1mAuto	   22mCause the Up/Down/Right/Left,  Wider/Narrower/Shorter/Taller,
		 Restore,   and	  the	special	  S3  buttons  to  be  applied
		 immediately.  This button can be toggled.

       1mTest	   22mTemporarily switch to the selected settings.

       1mRestore   22mReturn the settings to their original values.

       1mFetch	   22mQuery the server for its current settings.

       1mShow	   22mPrint the currently selected settings to stdout in XF86Config
		 "Modeline" format.  The primary selection is similarly set.

       1mNext	   22mSwitch the Xserver to the next video mode.

       1mPrev	   22mSwitch the Xserver to the previous video mode.

       For some S3-based cards (964 and 968) the following are also available:

       1mInvertVCLK0m
		 Change the VCLK invert/non-invert state.

       1mEarlySC   22mChange the Early SC state.  This affects screen wrapping.

       1mBlankDelay10m
       1mBlankDelay20m
		 Set the blank delay values.  This  affects  screen  wrapping.
		 Acceptable  values  are  in the range 0-7.  The values may be
		 incremented or decremented with the `+' and `-'  buttons,  or
		 by pressing the `+' or `-' keys in the text field.

       For  S3-864/868	based  cards 4mInvertVCLK24m and 4mBlankDelay124m may be useful.
       For S3 Trio32/Trio64 cards only 4mInvertVCLK24m is available.  At the moment
       there  are  no  default settings available for these chips in the video
       mode extension and thus this feature is disabled in xvidtune.   It  can
       be  enabled  by	setting	 any of the optional S3 commands in the screen
       section of XF86Config, e.g. using
		 1mblank_delay 4m22m"*"24m 1m00m

1mOPTIONS0m
       4mxvidtune24m accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as
       the following:

       1m-show	   22mPrint the current settings to stdout in XF86Config "Modeline"
		 format and exit.

       1m-prev	   22mSwitch the Xserver to the previous video mode.

       1m-next	   22mSwitch the Xserver to the next video mode.

       1m-unlock   22mNormally, 4mxvidtune24m will disable the switching of video  modes
		 via  hot-keys	while  it  is running.	If for some reason the
		 program did not exit cleanly and they are still disabled, the
		 program  can be re-run with this option to re-enable the mode
		 switching key combinations.

1mNAME0m
       Xvfb - virtual framebuffer X server for X Version 11

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mXvfb 22m[ option ] ...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXvfb24m  is  an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
       and no physical input devices.  It emulates a  dumb  framebuffer	 using
       virtual memory.

       The  primary use of this server was intended to be server testing.  The
       mfb or cfb code for any depth can be exercised with this server without
       the  need  for  real  hardware that supports the desired depths.	 The X
       community has found many other novel uses for 4mXvfb24m,	 including  testing
       clients	against	 unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch
       processing with 4mXvfb24m as a background rendering engine, load testing, as
       an  aid	to  porting  the  X server to a new platform, and providing an
       unobtrusive way to run applications that don't really need an X	server
       but insist on having one anyway.

1mBUILDING0m
       To build 4mXvfb24m, put the following in your host.def and remake.

       #define BuildServer YES /* if you aren't already building other servers
       */
       #define XVirtualFramebufferServer YES


1mOPTIONS0m
       In addition to the normal server options described  in  the  4mXserver(1)0m
       manual page, 4mXvfb24m accepts the following command line switches:

       1m-screen 4m22mscreennum24m 4mW24m1mx4m22mH24m1mx4m22mD24m[1m@4m22mx24m1m,4m22my24m]
	   This	 option	 creates  screen 4mscreennum24m and sets its width, height,
	   and depth to W, H, and D respectively, and  optionally  the	screen
	   origin (for Xinerama purposes) to (x,y).  By default, only screen 0
	   exists and has the dimensions 1280x1024x8.  If a screen  origin  is
	   not	specified  when using Xinerama, the default is for screen 4mN24m to
	   be positioned to the right of screen 4mN-124m.

       1m-pixdepths 4m22mlist-of-depths0m
	   This option specifies a list	 of  pixmap  depths  that  the	server
	   should  support  in addition to the depths implied by the supported
	   screens.  4mlist-of-depths24m is a space-separated list of integers that
	   can have values from 1 to 32.

       1m-fbdir 4m22mframebuffer-directory0m
	   This	 option	 specifies  the	 directory  in which the memory mapped
	   files containing the framebuffer memory  should  be	created.   See
	   FILES.   This option only exists on machines that have the mmap and
	   msync system calls.

       1m-shmem0m
	   This option specifies that the framebuffer should be put in	shared
	   memory.   The  shared  memory ID for each screen will be printed by
	   the server.	The shared memory is in xwd format.  This option  only
	   exists  on  machines	 that  support	the  System  V	shared	memory
	   interface.

       If neither 1m-shmem 22mnor 1m-fbdir 22mis specified, the framebuffer memory  will
       be allocated with malloc().

       1m-linebias 4m22mn0m
	   This option specifies how to adjust the pixelization of thin lines.
	   The value 4mn24m is a bitmask of octants in which  to  prefer  an  axial
	   step	 when  the Bresenham error term is exactly zero.  See the file
	   Xserver/mi/miline.h for more information.  This option is  probably
	   only	 useful	 to  server developers to experiment with the range of
	   line pixelization possible with the cfb and mfb code.

       1m-blackpixel 4m22mpixel-value24m1m, -whitepixel 4m22mpixel-value0m
	   These options specify the black and white pixel values  the	server
	   should use.

1mFILES0m
       The following files are created if the -fbdir option is given.

       4mframebuffer-directory24m/Xvfb_screen<n>
	   Memory  mapped  file	 containing screen n's framebuffer memory, one
	   file per screen.  The file is in xwd format.	 Thus, taking a	 full-
	   screen  snapshot  can  be  done  with  a file copy command, and the
	   resulting snapshot will even contain the cursor image.

1mEXAMPLES0m
       Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1600x1200x32
	       The server will listen for connections as server number 1,  and
	       screen 0 will be depth 32 1600x1200.

       Xvfb :1 -screen 1 1600x1200x16
	       The server will listen for connections as server number 1, will
	       have   the   default   screen   configuration   (one    screen,
	       1280x1024x8), and screen 1 will be depth 16 1600x1200.

       Xvfb -pixdepths 3 27 -fbdir /usr/tmp
	       The server will listen for connections as server number 0, will
	       have   the   default   screen   configuration   (one    screen,
	       1280x1024x8),  will also support pixmap depths of 3 and 27, and
	       will use memory mapped files in /usr/tmp for the framebuffer.

       xwud -in /usr/tmp/Xvfb_screen0
	       Displays screen 0  of  the  server  started  by	the  preceding
	       example.

       4mdisplay24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXwd24m	 is  an X Window System window dumping utility.	 4mXwd24m allows X users
       to store window images in a specially formatted dump file.   This  file
       can  then be read by various other X utilities for redisplay, printing,
       editing, formatting, archiving,	image  processing,  etc.   The	target
       window  is selected by clicking the pointer in the desired window.  The
       keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of the dump and twice  when
       the dump is completed.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This  argument  allows you to specify the server to connect to;
	       see 4mX(7)24m.


       1m-help	 22mPrint out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.


       1m-nobdrs 22mThis argument specifies that the window dump should not include
	       the pixels that compose the X window border.  This is useful in
	       situations where you may wish to include the window contents in
	       a document as an illustration.


       1m-out 4m22mfile0m
	       This  argument allows the user to explicitly specify the output
	       file on the command line.  The default is to output to standard
	       out.


       1m-xy	 22mThis  option  applies  to  color displays only. It selects `XY'
	       format dumping instead of the default `Z' format.


       1m-add 4m22mvalue0m
	       This option specifies an signed value  to  be  added  to	 every
	       pixel.


       1m-frame	 22mThis  option  indicates that the window manager frame should be
	       included when manually selecting a window.


       1m-root	 22mThis option indicates that the root window should  be  selected
	       for  the	 window	 dump,	without requiring the user to select a
	       window with the pointer.


       1m-id 4m22mid24m	 This option  indicates	 that  the  window  with  the  specified
	       resource	 id  should  be	 selected for the window dump, without
	       requiring the user to select a window with the pointer.


       1m-name 4m22mname0m
	       This option  indicates  that  the  window  with	the  specified
	       WM_NAME	property  should  be  selected	for  the  window dump,
	       without requiring the user to select a window with the pointer.


       1m-rect	 22mThis  option  indicates  that  the rectangle region of a screen
	       should be selected with the pointer. Window-related  parameters
	       like 1mnobdrs 22mand 1mframe 22mare ignored.


       1m-icmap	 22mNormally  the  colormap  of the chosen window is used to obtain
	       RGB values.  This option forces the first installed colormap of
	       the screen to be used instead.


       1m-screen 22mThis  option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain
	       the image should be  done  on  the  root	 window,  rather  than
	       directly	 on the specified window.  In this way, you can obtain
	       pieces of other windows that overlap the specified window,  and
	       more  importantly,  you	can capture menus or other popups that
	       are independent windows but appear over the specified window.


       1m-silent 22mOperate silently, i.e. don't ring any bells	 before	 and  after
	       dumping the window.

       [-tree] [-stats] [-bits]	 [-events]  [-size]  [-wm]  [-shape]  [-frame]
       [-all] [-english] [-metric] [-display 4mdisplay24m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXwininfo24m  is  a  utility  for  displaying  information  about  windows.
       Various	information  is	 displayed  depending  on  which  options  are
       selected.  If no options are chosen, 1m-stats 22mis assumed.

       The  user  has the option of selecting the target window with the mouse
       (by clicking any mouse button in the desired window) or	by  specifying
       its  window  id on the command line with the 1m-id 22moption.  Or instead of
       specifying the window by its id number, the 1m-name 22moption may be used to
       specify which window is desired by name.	 There is also a special 1m-root0m
       option to quickly obtain information on the screen's root window.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-help	 22mPrint out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.


       1m-id 4m22mid24m	 This option allows the user to specify a target  window  4mid24m  on
	       the  command  line  rather  than	 using the mouse to select the
	       target window.  This is very useful in debugging X applications
	       where  the  target  window is not mapped to the screen or where
	       the use of the mouse might be impossible or interfere with  the
	       application.


       1m-name 4m22mname0m
	       This  option  allows  the user to specify that the window named
	       4mname24m is the target window on the command line rather than using
	       the mouse to select the target window.


       1m-root	 22mThis  option  specifies  that  X's	root  window  is the target
	       window.	This is useful in situations where the root window  is
	       completely obscured.


       1m-int	 22mThis option specifies that all X window ids should be displayed
	       as  integer  values.   The  default  is	to  display  them   as
	       hexadecimal values.


       1m-children0m
	       This  option causes the root, parent, and children windows' ids
	       and names of the selected window to be displayed.


       1m-tree	 22mThis  option  is  like  1m-children	 22mbut	 displays  all	children
	       recursively.


       1m-stats	 22mThis option causes the display of various attributes pertaining
	       to  the	location  and  appearance  of  the  selected   window.
	       Information  displayed includes the location of the window, its
	       width and height, its depth, border width, class,  colormap  id
	       if  any,	 map  state,  backing-store  hint, and location of the
	       corners.


       1m-bits	 22mThis option causes the display of various attributes pertaining
	       to  the	selected window's raw bits and how the selected window
	       is to be stored.	 Displayed information includes	 the  selected
	       window's	 bit  gravity,	window	gravity,  backing-store	 hint,
	       backing-planes value, backing pixel, and	 whether  or  not  the
	       window has save-under set.


       1m-events 22mThis  option  causes  the  selected	 window's event masks to be
	       displayed.  Both the event mask of events wanted by some client
	       and the event mask of events not to propagate are displayed.


       1m-size	 22mThis  option  causes  the  selected window's sizing hints to be
	       displayed.  Displayed information includes: for both the normal
	       size  hints and the zoom size hints, the user supplied location
	       if any; the program supplied location if any; the user supplied
	       size if any; the program supplied size if any; the minimum size
	       if any; the maximum size if any; the resize increments if  any;
	       and the minimum and maximum aspect ratios if any.


       1m-wm	 22mThis  option  causes the selected window's window manager hints
	       to be displayed.	 Information displayed may include whether  or
	       not  the	 application  accepts  input,  what  the window's icon
	       window # and name is, where the window's icon  should  go,  and
	       what the window's initial state should be.


       1m-shape	 22mThis  option  causes  the  selected	 window's window and border
	       shape extents to be displayed.

       1m-frame	 22mThis option causes window manager frames to be considered  when
	       manually selecting windows.


       1m-metric 22mThis  option  causes  all individual height, width, and x and y
	       positions to be displayed in millimeters as well as  number  of
	       pixels,	based  on  what	 the  server thinks the resolution is.
	       Geometry specifications that are in 1m+x+y 22mform are not  changed.

       1m-english0m
	       This  option  causes  all individual height, width, and x and y
	       positions to be displayed in inches (and feet, yards, and miles
	       if necessary) as well as number of pixels. 1m-metric 22mand 1m-english0m
	       may both be enabled at the same time.


       1m-all	 22mThis option is a quick way to ask for all information possible.


       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see

XWUD(1)								       XWUD(1)



1mNAME0m
       xwud - image displayer for X

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mxwud 22m[-in 4mfile24m] [-noclick] [-geometry 4mgeom24m] [-display  4mdisplay24m]  [-new]
       [-std  <maptype>] [-raw] [-vis <vis-type-or-id>] [-scale] [-help] [-rv]
       [-plane 4mnumber24m] [-fg 4mcolor24m] [-bg 4mcolor24m] [-dumpheader]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mXwud24m is an X Window System image  undumping	 utility.   4mXwud24m  allows  X
       users  to  display  in a window an image saved in a specially formatted
       dump file, such as produced by 4mxwd(1)24m.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-bg 4m22mcolor0m
	       If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed,
	       this option can be used to specify the color to display for the
	       "0" bits in the image.


       1m-display 4m22mdisplay0m
	       This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
	       4mX(7)24m.


       1m-dumpheader0m
	       This  option  prints  out  the  XWD  header  information	 only.
	       Nothing is displayed.


       1m-fg 4m22mcolor0m
	       If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed,
	       this option can be used to specify the color to display for the
	       "1" bits in the image.


       1m-geometry 4m22mgeom0m
	       This option allows you to specify the size and position of  the
	       window.	 Typically you will only want to specify the position,
	       and let the size default to the actual size of the image.


       1m-help	 22mPrint out a short description of the allowable options.


       1m-in 4m22mfile0m
	       This option allows the user to  explicitly  specify  the	 input
	       file  on	 the  command  line.   If  no input file is given, the
	       standard input is assumed.


       1m-new	 22mThis option forces creation of a new  colormap  for	 displaying
	       the  image.  If the image characteristics happen to match those
	       of the display, this can get the image on  the  screen  faster,
	       but at the cost of using a new colormap (which on most displays
	       will cause other windows to go technicolor).


       1m-noclick0m
	       Clicking	 any  button  in  the  window	will   terminate   the
	       application,  unless this option is specified.  Termination can
	       always be achieved by typing 'q', 'Q', or ctrl-c.


       1m-plane 4m22mnumber0m
	       You can select a single bit plane of the image to display  with
	       this  option.   Planes  are  numbered with zero being the least
	       significant bit.


       1m-raw	 22mThis option forces the image  to  be  displayed  with  whatever
	       color  values  happen  to  currently exist on the screen.  This
	       option is mostly useful when undumping an image back  onto  the
	       same  screen  that  the	image  originally came from, while the
	       original windows are  still  on	the  screen,  and  results  in
	       getting the image on the screen faster.


       1m-rv	 22mIf a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed,
	       this option forces the foreground and background colors	to  be
	       swapped.	  This	may  be	 needed when displaying a bitmap image
	       which has the color sense of pixel values "0" and "1"  reversed
	       from what they are on your display.


       1m-scale	 22mAllow the window to be resized, and scale the image to the size
	       of the window.


       1m-std 4m22mmaptype0m
	       This  option  causes  the  image	 to  be	 displayed  using  the
	       specified  Standard Colormap.  The property name is obtained by
	       converting the type  to	upper  case,  prepending  "RGB_",  and
	       appending  "_MAP".   Typical  types  are "best", "default", and
	       "gray".	See 4mxstdcmap(1)24m  for  one	way  of	 creating  Standard
	       Colormaps.


       1m-vis 4m22mvis-type-or-id0m
	       This option allows you to specify a particular visual or visual
	       class.  The default is to pick the "best"  one.	 A  particular
	       class	can    be    specified:	  "StaticGray",	  "GrayScale",
	       "StaticColor", "PseudoColor",  "DirectColor",  or  "TrueColor".
	       Or  "Match" can be specified, meaning use the same class as the
	       source image.  Alternatively, an exact visual id	 (specific  to
	       the  server)  can  be specified, either as a hexadecimal number
	       (prefixed  with	"0x")  or  as  a  decimal  number.    Finally,
	       "default"  can  be  specified, meaning to use the same class as
	       the colormap of the root window.	 Case is  not  significant  in
	       any of these strings.

PolyglotMan(1)							PolyglotMan(1)



1mNAME0m
       PolyglotMan, rman - reverse compile man pages from formatted form to  a
       number of source formats

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       rman [ 4moptions24m ] [ 4mfile24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       4mPolyglotMan24m	  takes	 man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX
       and transforms them into any  of	 a  number  of	text  source  formats.
       PolyglotMan was formerly known as RosettaMan. The name of the binary is
       still called 4mrman24m , for scripts that depend on that name; mnemonically,
       just  think "reverse man". Previously 4mPolyglotMan24m  required pages to be
       formatted by nroff prior	 to  its  processing.  With  version  3.0,  it
       4mprefers24m  4m[tn]roff24m  4msource24m	 and usually produces results that are better
       yet. And source processing is the only way to translate tables.	Source
       format  translation  is	not  as	 mature	 as formatted, however, so try
       formatted translation as a backup.

       In parsing [tn]roff source, one could implement	an  arbitrarily	 large
       subset of [tn]roff, which I did not and will not do, so the results can
       be off. I did implement a significant subset of those use in man pages,
       however,	 including  tbl	 (but  not  eqn),  if tests, and general macro
       definitions, so usually the results look great. If they	don't,	format
       the  page  with	nroff before sending it to PolyglotMan. If PolyglotMan
       doesn't recognize a key macro used by a large class of pages,  however,
       e-mail  me the source and a uuencoded nroff-formatted page and I'll see
       what I can do. When running  PolyglotMan	 with  man  page  source  that
       includes or redirects to other [tn]roff source using the .so (source or
       inclusion) macro, you should be in the parent directory	of  the	 page,
       since  pages  are written with this assumption. For example, if you are
       translating /usr/man/man1/ls.1, first cd into /usr/man.

       4mPolyglotMan24m	 accepts man  pages  from:  SunOS,  Sun	 Solaris,  Hewlett-
       Packard	HP-UX,	AT&T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX, DEC Ultrix, SGI
       IRIX, Linux, FreeBSD, SCO. Source  processing  works  for:  SunOS,  Sun
       Solaris,	 Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX,
       DEC Ultrix. It can produce  printable  ASCII-only  (control  characters
       stripped),  section  headers-only, Tk, TkMan, [tn]roff (traditional man
       page source), SGML, HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e,	RTF,  Perl  5  POD.  A
       modular	 architecture  permits	easy  addition	of  additional	output
       formats.

       The  latest  version  of	  PolyglotMan	is   always   available	  from
       4mftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z24m .

1mOPTIONS0m
       The  following  options	should	not  be	 used with any others and exit
       PolyglotMan without processing any input.

       -h|--help      Show list of command line options and exit.

       -v|--version   Show version number and exit.

       4m-f|--filter0m
       4m<ASCII|roff|TkMan|Tk|Sections|HTML|SGML|MIME|LaTeX|LaTeX2e|RTF|POD>0m
		      Set the output filter. Defaults to ASCII.

       -S|--source    PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine whether its
		      input is source or formatted; use this option to declare
		      source input.

       -F|--format|--formatted
		      PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine whether its
		      input is source or formatted; use this option to declare
		      formatted input.

       -l|--title 4mprintf-string0m
		      In  HTML	mode  this  sets the <TITLE> of the man pages,
		      given the same parameters as 4m-r24m .

       -r|--reference|--manref 4mprintf-string0m
		      In HTML and SGML modes this sets the URL form  by	 which
		      to  retrieve  other  man	pages.	The string can use two
		      supplied parameters: the man page name and its  section.
		      (See  the	 Examples section.)  If the string is null (as
		      if set from a shell by "-r ''"), `-' or `off', then  man
		      page  references will not be HREFs, just set in italics.
		      If your printf supports XPG3 positions  specifier,  this
		      can be quite flexible.

       -V|--volumes 4m<colon-separated24m 4mlist>0m
		      Set  the	list  of  valid	 volumes to check against when
		      looking  for  cross-references  to  other	  man	pages.
		      Defaults	to 4m1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:o:l:n:p24m (volume names can
		      be multicharacter). If an non-whitespace string  in  the
		      page is immediately followed by a left parenthesis, then
		      one of the valid volumes, and ends with  optional	 other
		      characters  and  then  a	right  parenthesis--then  that
		      string is reported as  a	reference  to  another	manual
		      page. If this -V string starts with an equals sign, then
		      no optional characters are allowed between the match  to
		      the  list	 of  valids  and  the right parenthesis. (This
		      option is needed for SCO UNIX.)

       The following options apply only when  formatted	 pages	are  given  as
       input.  They  do	 not  apply  or	 are always handled correctly with the
       source.

       -b|--subsections
		      Try  to  recognize  subsection  titles  in  addition  to
		      section  titles.	 This  can cause problems on some UNIX
		      flavors.

       -K|--nobreak   Indicate manual pages don't have page breaks,  so	 don't
		      look  for	 footers and headers around them. (Older nroff
		      -man macros always put in page breaks, but  lately  some
		      vendors  have  realized  that  printout are made through
		      troff, whereas nroff -man is used to  format  pages  for
		      reading  on screen, and so have eliminated page breaks.)
		      4mPolyglotMan24m	usually gets this right even  without  this
		      flag.

       -k|--keep      Keep  headers  and footers, as a canonical report at the
		      end of the page. changeleft  Move	 changebars,  such  as
		      those found in the Tcl/Tk manual pages, to the left. -->
		      notaggressive  4mDisable24m   aggressive	man  page  parsing.
		      Aggressive  manual, which is on by default, page parsing
		      elides headers  and  footers,  identifies	 sections  and
		      more. -->

       -n|--name 4mname24m Set	name  of  man  page  (used  in roff format). If the
		      filename is given in the form " 4mname24m .  4msection24m	 ",  the
		      name  and	 section  are automatically determined. If the
		      page is being parsed from [tn]roff source and it	has  a
		      .TH  line, this information is extracted from that line.

       -p|--paragraph paragraph mode toggle.  The  filter  determines  whether
		      lines  should  be	 linebroken  as they were by nroff, or
		      whether lines should be flowed together into paragraphs.
		      Mainly for internal use.

       -s|section 4m#24m   Set	volume	(aka  section)	number of man page (used in
		      roff format).  tables Turn on aggressive table  parsing.
		      -->

       -t|--tabstops 4m#0m
		      For  those  macros sets that use tabs in place of spaces
		      where  possible  in  order  to  reduce  the  number   of
		      characters used, set tabstops every 4m#24m  columns. Defaults
		      to 8.

1mNOTES ON FILTER TYPES0m
   1mROFF0m
       Some flavors of UNIX ship man  page  without  [tn]roff  source,	making
       one's laser printer little more than a laser-powered daisy wheel.  This
       filer tries to intuit the original [tn]roff directives, which can  then
       be recompiled by [tn]roff.

   1mTkMan0m
       TkMan, a hypertext man page browser, uses 4mPolyglotMan24m to show man pages
       without the (usually) useless headers and footers  on  each  pages.  It
       also  collects  section	and  (optionally)  subsection heads for direct
       access from a pulldown menu. TkMan and Tcl/Tk,  the  toolkit  in	 which
       it's    written,	   are	  available    via    anonymous	   ftp	  from
       4mftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/0m

   1mTk0m
       This option outputs the text in a series of  Tcl	 lists	consisting  of
       text-tags  pairs,  where	 tag  names  roughly correspond to HTML.  This
       output can be  inserted	into  a	 Tk  text  widget  by  doing  an  4meval0m
       4m<textwidget>24m  4minsert24m  4mend24m	 4m<text>24m  .	 This  format should be relatively
       easily parsable by other programs that want both the text and the tags.
       Also see ASCII.

   1mASCII0m
       When  printed  on a line printer, man pages try to produce special text
       effects by overstriking characters with themselves  (to	produce	 bold)
       and  underscores (underlining). Other text processing software, such as
       text editors, searchers, and indexers, must counteract this. The	 ASCII
       filter  strips away this formatting. Piping nroff output through 4mcol24m 4m-b0m
       also strips away this formatting, but it leaves behind  unsightly  page
       headers and footers. Also see Tk.

   1mSections0m
       Dumps  section and (optionally) subsection titles. This might be useful
       for another program that processes man pages.

   1mHTML0m
       With a simple extension to an HTTP server for  Mosaic  or  other	 World
       Wide  Web  browser,  4mPolyglotMan24m   can produce high quality HTML on the
       fly. Several  such  extensions  and  pointers  to  several  others  are
       included in 4mPolyglotMan24m 's 4mcontrib24m  directory.

   1mSGML0m
       This  is	 approaching the Docbook DTD, but I'm hoping that someone that
       someone with a real interest in this will polish	 the  tags  generated.
       Try it to see how close the tags are now.

   1mMIME0m
       MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail Extensions) as defined by RFC 1563,
       good for consumption by MIME-aware  e-mailers  or  as  Emacs  (>=19.29)
       enriched documents.

   1mLaTeX and LaTeX2e0m
       Why not?

   1mRTF0m
       Use  output on Mac or NeXT or whatever. Maybe take random man pages and
       integrate with NeXT's documentation system better.  Maybe NeXT has  own
       man page macros that do this.

   1mPostScript and FrameMaker0m
       To  produce  PostScript,	 use  4mgroff24m  or 4mpsroff24m . To produce FrameMaker
       MIF, use FrameMaker's builtin filter. In both cases you	need  4m[tn]roff0m
       source, so if you only have a formatted version of the manual page, use
       4mPolyglotMan24m 's roff filter first.

1mEXAMPLES0m
       To convert the 4mformatted24m  man  page	 named	4mls.124m   back  into	[tn]roff
       source form:

       4mrman24m 4m-f24m 4mroff24m 4m/usr/local/man/cat1/ls.124m 4m>24m 4m/usr/local/man/man1/ls.10m

       Long  man  pages are often compressed to conserve space (compression is
       especially effective on formatted man pages as many of  the  characters
       are  spaces).  As  it  is a long man page, it probably has subsections,
       which we try  to	 separate  out	(some  macro  sets  don't  distinguish
       subsections  well enough for 4mPolyglotMan24m to detect them). Let's convert
       this to LaTeX format:

       4mpcat24m 4m/usr/catman/a_man/cat1/automount.z24m 4m|24m 4mrman24m 4m-b24m 4m-n24m 4mautomount24m 4m-s24m 4m124m	 4m-f0m
       4mlatex24m 4m>24m 4mautomount.man0m

       Alternatively,  4mman24m	 4m124m 4mautomount24m 4m|24m 4mrman24m 4m-b24m 4m-n24m 4mautomount24m 4m-s24m 4m124m 4m-f24m 4mlatex24m 4m>0m
       4mautomount.man0m

       For HTML/Mosaic users, 4mPolyglotMan24m	can, without  modification  of	the
       source  code,  produce  HTML  links  that point to other HTML man pages
       either pregenerated  or	generated  on  the  fly.  First	 let's	assume
       pregenerated  HTML  versions  of	 man  pages  stored in 4m/usr/man/html24m .
       Generate these one-by-one with the following form:
       4mrman24m 4m-f24m 4mhtml24m 4m-r24m  4m'http:/usr/man/html/%s.%s.html'24m  4m/usr/man/cat1/ls.124m  4m>0m
       4m/usr/man/html/ls.1.html0m

       If  you've  extended  your  HTML client to generate HTML on the fly you
       should use something like:
       4mrman24m 4m-f24m 4mhtml24m 4m-r24m 4m'http:~/bin/man2html?%s:%s'24m 4m/usr/man/cat1/ls.10m
       when generating HTML.

1mBUGS/INCOMPATIBILITIES0m
       4mPolyglotMan24m	 is not perfect in all cases, but it usually  does  a  good
       job,  and  in  any  case reduces the problem of converting man pages to
       light editing.

       Tables in formatted pages, especially H-P's, aren't handled very	 well.
       Be sure to pass in source for the page to recognize tables.

       The  man pager 4mwoman24m  applies its own idea of formatting for man pages,
       which can confuse 4mPolyglotMan24m . Bypass 4mwoman24m  by passing the  formatted
       manual page text directly into 4mPolyglotMan24m .

       The  [tn]roff  output format uses fB to turn on boldface. If your macro
       set requires .B, you'll have to a postprocess the 4mPolyglotMan24m output.
