       NOTE: This documentation does not completely match the
       implementation in R6 (as a result of some late changes made
       in the code).  Specifically, support was added for font
       server cloning, and conditional compliation was introduced
       for client vs. server code.

       The  X Transport Interface is intended to combine all system
       and transport specific code  into  a  single  place  in	the
       source  tree.  This  API	 should	 be  used by all libraries,
       clients and servers of the X Window System. Use of this	API
       should  allow  the  addition  of new types of transports and
       support for new platforms without making any changes to	the
       source except in the X Transport Interface code.

       This  interface	should solve the problem of multiple #ifdef
       TRANSPORT   and	 #ifdef	  PLATFORM   statements	  scattered
       throughout the source tree.

       This   interface	 should	 provide  enough  functionality	 to
       support	all  types  of	protocols,   including	 connection
       oriented	 protocols  such as X11 and FS, and connection-less
       oriented protocols such as XDMCP.


       4m2.24m	4mOverview24m 4mof24m 4mthe24m 4minterface0m



       The interface provides an API for use by	 applications.	The
       functions  in  this  API	 perform work that is common to all
       transports and systems, such as parsing an  address  into  a
       host  and  port	number.	 The  functions	 in  this  API call
       transport specific functions that are contained in  a  table
       whose  contents	are  defined  at  compile  time. This table
       contains an entry for each type of transport. Each entry	 is
       a   record  containing  mostly  pointers	 to  function  that
       implements the interface for the given transport.

       This API does not provide an  abstraction  for  select()	 or
       poll().	   These    function   are   themselves	  transport
       independent, so an additional interface is  not	needed	for
       these  functions.   It is also unclear how such an interface
       would affect performance.


       4m3.24m	4mDefinition24m 4mof24m 4mAddress24m 4mSpecification24m 4mFormat0m



       Addresses are specified in the following syntax,

       4mprotocol/host:port0m

       where 4mprotocol24m specifies a protocol family or an alias for a
       protocol family. A definition of common protocol families is
       given in a later section.












       The 4mhost24m  part  specifies  the  name  of  a	 host  or  other
       transport  dependent  entity  that could be interpreted as a
       Network Service Access Point (NSAP).

       The 4mport24m part specifies the	 name  of  a  Transport	 Service
       Access  Point  (TSAP).  The format of the TSAP is defined by
       the  underlying	transport   implementation,   but   it	 is
       represented  using  a  string  format  when it is part of an
       address.


       4m4.24m	4mInternal24m 4mData24m 4mStructures0m



       There are two major  data  structures  associated  with	the
       transport independent portion of this interface.	 Additional
       data structures may be used internally by each transport.

       4m4.124m	 4mXtransport0m



       Each transport supported	 has  an  entry	 in  the  transport
       table.	The  transport	table  is  an  array  of 4mXtransport0m
       records. Each record contains all the  entry  points  for  a
       single transport. This record is defined as:







































       typedef struct _Xtransport {

	   char *TransName;
	   int	flags;

	   XtransConnInfo (*OpenCOTSClient)(
	    struct _Xtransport *,    /* transport */
	    char *,		/* protocol */
	    char *,		/* host */
	    char *		/* port */
	   );

	   XtransConnInfo (*OpenCOTSServer)(
	    struct _Xtransport *,    /* transport */
	    char *,		/* protocol */
	    char *,		/* host */
	    char *		/* port */
	   );

	   XtransConnInfo (*OpenCLTSClient)(
	    struct _Xtransport *,    /* transport */
	    char *,		/* protocol */
	    char *,		/* host */
	    char *		/* port */
	   );

	   XtransConnInfo (*OpenCLTSServer)(
	    struct _Xtransport *,    /* transport */
	    char *,		/* protocol */
	    char *,		/* host */
	    char *		/* port */
	   );

	   int	 (*SetOption)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    int,	   /* option */
	    int		   /* arg */
	   );

	   int	 (*CreateListener)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    char *,		/* port */
	    int		   /* flags */
	   );

	   int	 (*ResetListener)(
	    XtransConnInfo	/* connection */
	   );

	   XtransConnInfo (*Accept)(
	    XtransConnInfo	/* connection */
	   );

	   int	 (*Connect)(












	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    char *,		/* host */
	    char *		/* port */
	   );

	   int	 (*BytesReadable)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    BytesReadable_t *	/* pend */
	   );

	   int	 (*Read)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    char *,		/* buf */
	    int		   /* size */
	   );

	   int	 (*Write)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    char *,		/* buf */
	    int		   /* size */
	   );

	   int	 (*Readv)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    struct iovec *,	     /* buf */
	    int		   /* size */
	   );

	   int	 (*Writev)(
	    XtransConnInfo,	     /* connection */
	    struct iovec *,	     /* buf */
	    int		   /* size */
	   );

	   int	 (*Disconnect)(
	    XtransConnInfo	/* connection */
	   );

	   int	 (*Close)(
	    XtransConnInfo	/* connection */
	   );

       } Xtransport;



       The 4mflags24m field can contain an OR of the following masks:

       4mTRANS_ALIAS24m:  indicates  that  this	 record	 is providing an
       alias, and should not be used to create a listner.

       4mTRANS_LOCAL24m: indicates that this is a LOCALCONN transport.














       4m4.224m	 4mXtransConnInfo0m



       Each connection will have an opaque 4mXtransConnInfo24m transport
       connection  object  allocated  for  it. This record contains
       information  specific  to  the  connection.  The	 record	 is
       defined as:

       typedef struct _XtransConnInfo *XtransConnInfo;

       struct _XtransConnInfo {
	   struct _Xtransport	  *transptr;
	   char	 *priv;
	   int	      flags;
	   int	      fd;
	   int	      family;
	   char	 *addr;
	   int	      addrlen;
	   char	 *peeraddr;
	   int	      peeraddrlen;
       };



       4m5.24m	4mExposed24m 4mTransport24m 4mIndependent24m 4mAPI0m



       This  API  is  included in each library and server that uses
       it. The API may be used by the library, but it is not  added
       to  the	public	API  for  that	library.  This interface is
       simply an implementation facilitator. This  API	contains  a
       low  level  set	of  core  primitives,  and  a  few  utility
       functions that are built	 on  top  of  the  primitives.	The
       utility functions exist to provide a more familiar interface
       that can be used to port existing code.

       A macro is defined in Xtrans.h for TRANS(func) that  creates
       a  unique  function  name  depending  on	 where	the code is
       compiled.   For	  example,    when    built    for    Xlib,
       TRANS(OpenCOTSClient) becomes _X11TransOpenCOTSClient.

       All failures are considered fatal, and the connection should
       be closed and re-established  if	 desired.  In  most  cases,
       however,	 the value of errno will be available for debugging
       purposes.

       4m5.124m	 4mCore24m 4mInterface24m 4mAPI0m



	   XtransConnInfo TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)(char *address)













	    This function creates a  Connection-Oriented  Transport
	    that  is  suitable	for use by a client.  The parameter
	    4maddress24m contains the full  address  of	 the  server  to
	    which  this endpoint will be connected.  This functions
	    returns  an	 opaque	 transport  connection	object	 on
	    success, or NULL on failure.

	   XtransConnInfo TRANS(OpenCOTSServer)(char *address)

	    This  function  creates a Connection-Oriented Transport
	    that is suitable for use by a  server.   The  parameter
	    4maddress24m  contains the full address to which this server
	    will  be  bound.   This  functions	returns	 an  opaque
	    transport  connection  object  on  success,	 or NULL on
	    failure.

	   XtransConnInfo TRANS(OpenCLTSClient)(char *address)

	    This function creates a Connection-Less Transport  that
	    is suitable for use by a client.  The parameter 4maddress0m
	    contains the full address of the server to	which  this
	    endpoint  will be connected.  This functions returns an
	    opaque transport connection object on success, or  NULL
	    on failure.

	   XtransConnInfo TRANS(OpenCLTSServer)(char *address)

	    This  function creates a Connection-Less Transport that
	    is suitable for use by a server.  The parameter 4maddress0m
	    contains  the full address to which this server will be
	    bound.  This  functions  returns  an  opaque  transport
	    connection object on success, or NULL on failure.

	   int	  TRANS(SetOption)(XtransConnInfo  connection,	int
	    option, int arg)

	    This function sets transport options,  similar  to	the
	    way	 setsockopt()  and  ioctl()  work.   The  parameter
	    4mconnection24m  is	 an  endpoint  that  was  obtained  from
	    _XTransOpen*()   functions.	   The	 parameter   4moption0m
	    contains the option that will be set. The actual values
	    for	 4moption24m  are  defined  in	a  later  section.   The
	    parameter 4marg24m can be used  to	pass  in  an  additional
	    value  that	 may  be  required  by	some options.  This
	    function return 0 on success and -1 on failure.

	    Note:  Based  on  current  usage,	the   complimentary
	    function TRANS(GetOption)() is not necessary.

	   int	  TRANS(CreateListener)(XtransConnInfo	connection,
	    char *port, int flags)

	    This  function  sets  up  the   server   endpoint	for
	    listening.	 The  parameter	 4mconnection24m  is an endpoint












	    that  was  obtained	 from  TRANS(OpenCOTSServer)()	 or
	    TRANS(OpenCLTSServer)().   The parameter 4mport24m specifies
	    the port to which this endpoint  should  be	 bound	for
	    listening.	 If  4mport24m	is  NULL, then the transport may
	    attempt  to	 allocate  any	available  TSAP	 for   this
	    connection.	 If the transport cannot support this, then
	    this  function  will  return  a  failure.	The   4mflags0m
	    parameter  can  be	set to ADDR_IN_USE_ALLOWED to allow
	    the call to the underlying	binding	 function  to  fail
	    with   a   EADDRINUSE   error   without   causing	the
	    TRANS(CreateListener) function itself  to  fail.   This
	    function return 0 on success and -1 on failure.

	   int TRANS(ResetListener)(XtransConnInfo connection)

	    When  a  server  is restarted, certain listen ports may
	    need to be reset.  For example, unix  domain  needs	 to
	    check that the file used for communication has not been
	    deleted.   If  it  has,  it	 must  be  recreated.	The
	    parameter  4mconnection24m	is  an opened and bound endpoint
	    that  was  obtained	 from  TRANS(OpenCOTSServer)()	and
	    passed  to TRANS(CreateListener)().	 This function will
	    return one of the following	 values:  TRANS_RESET_NOOP,
	    TRANS_RESET_NEW_FD, or TRANS_RESET_FAILURE.

	   XtransConnInfo TRANS(Accept)(XtransConnInfo connection)

	    Once a connection indication is received, this function
	    can	 be called to accept the connection.  The parameter
	    4mconnection24m is an opened and  bound  endpoint  that  was
	    obtained  from  TRANS(OpenCOTSServer)()  and  passed to
	    TRANS(CreateListener)().  This function will  return  a
	    new	 opaque	 transport  connection object upon success,
	    NULL otherwise.

	   int	 TRANS(Connect)(XtransConnInfo	 connection,   char
	    *address)

	    This  function  creates  a connection to a server.	The
	    parameter 4mconnection24m is an endpoint that  was	obtained
	    from  TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)().   The parameters 4maddress0m
	    specify the TSAP to which this endpoint should connect.
	    If	the protocol is included in the address, it will be
	    ignored.  This function return 0 on success and  -1	 on
	    failure.

	   int	  TRANS(BytesReadable)(XtransConnInfo	connection,
	    BytesReadable_t *pend);

	    This function provides the same  functionality  as	the
	    BytesReadable macro.

	   int	 TRANS(Read)(XtransConnInfo  connection, char *buf,
	    int size)












	    This function will return the number of bytes requested
	    on	a  COTS	 connection, and will return the minimum of
	    the number bytes requested or the size of the  incoming
	    packet on a CLTS connection.

	   int	 TRANS(Write)(XtransConnInfo connection, char *buf,
	    int size)

	    This function will write the requested number of  bytes
	    on	a  COTS	 connection,  and will send a packet of the
	    requested size on a CLTS connection.

	   int	 TRANS(Readv)(XtransConnInfo   connection,   struct
	    iovec *buf, int size)

	    Similar to TRANS(Read)().

	   int	  TRANS(Writev)(XtransConnInfo	connection,  struct
	    iovec *buf, int size)

	    Similar to TRANS(Write)().

	   int TRANS(Disconnect)(XtransConnInfo connection)

	    This function is used when	an  orderly  disconnect	 is
	    desired.  This  function  breaks  the connection on the
	    transport.	It  is	similar	 to  the  socket   function
	    shutdown().

	   int TRANS(Close)(XtransConnInfo connection)

	    This  function  closes  the	 transport, unbinds it, and
	    frees  all	resources  that	 was  associated  with	the
	    transport.	If a TRANS(Disconnect) call was not made on
	    the connection, a disorderly disconnect may occur.

	   int TRANS(IsLocal)(XtransConnInfo connection)

	    Returns TRUE if it is a local transport.

	   int TRANS(GetMyAddr)(XtransConnInfo connection,
		    int	  *familyp,   int   *addrlenp,	 Xtransaddr
	    **addrp)

	    This   function   is  similar  to  getsockname().  This
	    function will allocate space for  the  address,  so	 it
	    must  be  freed by the caller.  Not all transports will
	    have a valid address until a connection is established.
	    This  function  should not be used until the connection
	    is established with Connect() or Accept().

	   int TRANS(GetPeerAddr)(XtransConnInfo connection,
		    int	  *familyp,   int   *addrlenp,	 Xtransaddr
	    **addrp)












	    This   function  is	 similar  to  getpeername().   This
	    function will allocate space for  the  address,  so	 it
	    must  be  freed by the caller.  Not all transports will
	    have a valid address until a connection is established.
	    This  function  should not be used until the connection
	    is established with Connect() or Accept().

	   int		  TRANS(GetConnectionNumber)(XtransConnInfo
	    connection)

	    Returns   the  file	 descriptor  associated	 with  this
	    transport.

	   int TRANS(MakeAllCOTSServerListeners)(
		    char *port, int *partial_ret,  int	*count_ret,
	    XtransConnInfo **connections_ret)

	    This  function  should be used by most servers. It will
	    try to  establish  a  COTS	server	endpoint  for  each
	    transport  listed  in the transport table.	4mpartial_ret0m
	    will be set to True if only a partial network could	 be
	    created.	4mcount_ret24m	 is  the  number  of  transports
	    returns, and 4mconnections_ret24m is the list of transports.

	   int TRANS(MakeAllCLTSServerListeners)(
		    char  *port,  int *partial_ret, int *count_ret,
	    XtransConnInfo **connections_ret)

	    This function should be used by most servers.  It  will
	    try	 to  establish	a  CLTS	 server	 endpoint  for each
	    transport listed in the transport  table.	4mpartial_ret0m
	    will  be set to True if only a partial network could be
	    created.   4mcount_ret24m  is  the	number	 of   transports
	    returns, and 4mconnections_ret24m is the list of transports.

       4m5.224m	 4mUtility24m 4mAPI0m



       This section describes a few useful functions that have been
       implemented   on	 top  of  the  Core  Interface	API.  These
       functions are being provided as a convenience.

	   int TRANS(ConvertAddress)(int *familyp, int	 *addrlenp,
	    Xtransaddr *addrp)

	    This function converts a sockaddr based address to an X
	    authorization based address (ie AF_INET, AF_UNIX to the
	    X	  protocol     definition    (ie    FamilyInternet,
	    FamilyLocal)).
















       4m6.24m	4mTransport24m 4mOption24m 4mDefinition0m



       The following options are defined for the TRANS(SetOption)()
       function.  If  an  OS  or  transport does not support any of
       these options, then it will silently ignore the option.

	   TRANS_NONBLOCKING

	    This  option  controls  the	 blocking   mode   of	the
	    connection.	 If  the  argument  is	set  to 1, then the
	    connection will be set to blocking. If the argument	 is
	    set	 to  0,	 then  the  connection	will be set to non-
	    blocking.

	   TRANS_CLOSEONEXEC

	    This  option  determines  what  will  happen   to	the
	    connection when an exec is encountered. If the argument
	    is set to 1, then the connection will be closed when an
	    exec  occurs.  If  the  argument  is set to 0, then the
	    connection will not be closed when an exec occurs.


       4m7.24m	4mHidden24m 4mTransport24m 4mDependent24m 4mAPI0m



       The hidden transport dependent functions are placed  in	the
       Xtransport  record.   These  function  are  similar  to	the
       Exposed	Transport  Independent	API,  but   some   of	the
       parameters  and return values are slightly different.  Stuff
       like the #ifdef	SUNSYSV	 should	 be  handled  inside  these
       functions.

	   XtransConnInfo *OpenCOTSClient (
		    struct  _Xtransport *thistrans, char *protocol,
	    char *host, char *port)

	    This function creates a Connection-Oriented	 Transport.
	    The	 parameter  4mthistrans24m points to an Xtransport entry
	    in the transport table. The parameters 4mprotocol24m,  4mhost24m,
	    and	 4mport24m point to strings containing the corresponding
	    parts   of	 the   address	 that	was   passed   into
	    TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)().

	    This function must allocate and initialize the contents
	    of the XtransConnInfo structure  that  is  returned	 by
	    this  function.  This function will open the transport,
	    and bind it into the transport namespace if applicable.
	    The	  local	  address  portion  of	the  XtransConnInfo
	    structure will also be filled in by this function.













	   XtransConnInfo *OpenCOTSServer (
		    struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char	 *protocol,
	    char *host, char *port)

	    This  function creates a Connection-Oriented Transport.
	    The parameter 4mthistrans24m points to an  Xtransport  entry
	    in	the transport table. The parameters 4mprotocol24m, 4mhost24m,
	    and 4mport24m point to strings containing the  corresponding
	    parts   of	 the   address	 that	was   passed   into
	    TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)().

	    This function must allocate and initialize the contents
	    of	the  XtransConnInfo  structure	that is returned by
	    this function. This function will open the transport.

	   XtransConnInfo *OpenCLTSClient (
		    struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char	 *protocol,
	    char *host, char *port)

	    This  function creates a Connection-Less Transport. The
	    parameter 4mthistrans24m points to an  Xtransport  entry  in
	    the transport table. The parameters 4mprotocol24m, 4mhost24m, and
	    4mport24m point  to	 strings  containing  the  corresponding
	    parts   of	 the   address	 that	was   passed   into
	    TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)().

	    This function must allocate and initialize the contents
	    of	the  XtransConnInfo  structure	that is returned by
	    this function. This function will open  the	 transport,
	    and bind it into the transport namespace if applicable.
	    The	 local	address	 portion  of   the   XtransConnInfo
	    structure will also be filled in by this function.

	   XtransConnInfo *OpenCLTSServer (
		    struct  _Xtransport *thistrans, char *protocol,
	    char *host, char *port)

	    This function creates a Connection-Less Transport.	The
	    parameter  4mthistrans24m  points  to an Xtransport entry in
	    the transport table. The parameters 4mprotocol24m, 4mhost24m, and
	    4mport24m  point  to  strings  containing  the corresponding
	    parts   of	 the   address	 that	was   passed   into
	    TRANS(OpenCOTSClient)().

	    This function must allocate and initialize the contents
	    of the XtransConnInfo structure  that  is  returned	 by
	    this function. This function will open the transport.

	   int	  SetOption  (struct  _Xtransport  *thistrans,	int
	    option, int arg)

	    This function provides a  transport	 dependent  way	 of
	    implementing  the  options	defined	 by the X Transport
	    Interface. In the current prototype, this  function	 is












	    not	 being	used,  because all of the option defined so
	    far, are transport independent. This function will have
	    to	be  used if a radically different transport type is
	    added, or a transport dependent option is defined.

	   int CreateListener (struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char
	    *port, int flags )

	    This  function  takes a transport endpoint opened for a
	    server,  and  sets	it  up	to  listen   for   incoming
	    connection	requests. The parameter 4mport24m should contain
	    the port portion of the address that was passed to	the
	    Open function.

	    The	    parameter	 4mflags24m    should	 be    set    to
	    ADDR_IN_USE_ALLOWED	  if   the   underlying	  transport
	    endpoint  may  be  already bound and this should not be
	    considered as an error. Otherwise 4mflags24m sould be set to
	    0.	 This  is  used by IPv6 code, where the same socket
	    can be bound to both an IPv6 address and then to a IPv4
	    address.

	    This   function   will  bind  the  transport  into	the
	    transport name space if applicable,	 and  fill  in	the
	    local  address portion of the XtransConnInfo structure.
	    The transport endpoint will then be set to	listen	for
	    incoming connection requests.

	   int ResetListener (struct _Xtransport *thistrans)

	    This function resets the transport for listening.

	   XtransConnInfo Accept(struct _Xtransport *thistrans)

	    This  function  creates  a	new transport endpoint as a
	    result of an incoming connection request. The parameter
	    4mthistrans24m is the endpoint that was opened for listening
	    by the server. The new endpoint  is	 opened	 and  bound
	    into   the	 transport's  namespace.  A  XtransConnInfo
	    structure describing the new endpoint is returned  from
	    this function

	   int	 Connect(struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char *host,
	    char *port )

	    This function establishes a connection to a server. The
	    parameters	4mhost24m  and 4mport24m describe the server to which
	    the connection should be  established.  The	 connection
	    will be established so that Read() and Write() call can
	    be made.

	   int	  BytesReadable(struct	 _Xtransport	*thistrans,
	    BytesReadable_t *pend )













	    This  function replaces the BytesReadable() macro. This
	    allows each transport to have it's	own  mechanism	for
	    determining how much data is ready to be read.

	   int	 Read(struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char *buf, int
	    size )

	    This function  reads  4msize24m  bytes  into  4mbuf24m  from  the
	    connection.

	   int Write(struct _Xtransport *thistrans, char *buf, int
	    size )

	    This  function  writes  4msize24m  bytes  from  4mbuf24m  to  the
	    connection.

	   int	 Readv(struct  _Xtransport *thistrans, struct iovec
	    *buf, int size )

	    This function performs a readv() on the connection.

	   int Writev(struct _Xtransport *thistrans, struct  iovec
	    *buf, int size )

	    This function performs a writev() on the connection.

	   int Disconnect(struct _Xtransport *thistrans)

	    This  function  initiates  an  orderly  shutdown  of  a
	    connection. If a transport does not distinguish between
	    orderly and disorderly disconnects, then a call to this
	    function will have no affect.

	   int Close(struct _Xtransport *thistrans)

	    This function will break the connection, and close	the
	    endpoint.

       The   implementation  of	 each  transport  can  be  platform
       specific. It is expected that existing connection types such
       as  TCPCONN,  UNIXCONN,	LOCALCONN  and	STREAMSCONN will be
       replaced with flags for each possible transport type.

       Below are the flags that can be set  in	4mConnectionFlags24m  in
       the vendor.cf or site.def config files.

       TCPCONN	     Enables the INET (IPv4) Domain Socket based transport
       IPv6	     Extends TCPCONN to enable IPv6 Socket based transport













       UNIXCONN	     Enables the UNIX Domain Sokcet based transport
       STREAMSCONN   Enables the TLI based transports
       LOCALCONN     Enables the SYSV Local connection transports
       DNETCONN	     Enables the DECnet transports

       This  section refers to the prototype implementation that is
       being  developed	 concurrently  with  this  document.   This
       prototype  has  been  able  to  flush  out  many details and
       problems as the specification was being developed.

       All of the source code for  this	 interface  is	located	 in
       xc/lib/xtrans.

       All  functions  names  in  the  source  are  of	the  format
       TRANS(func)(). The TRANS() macro is defined as


       #if (__STDC__ && !defined(UNIXCPP)) || defined(ANSICPP)
       #define TRANS(func) _PROTOCOLTrans##func
       #else
       #define TRANS(func) _PROTOCOLTrans/**/func
       #endif


       PROTOCOL will be uniquely defined in  each  directory  where
       this  code  is  compiled. PROTOCOL will be defined to be the
       name of the protocol that is implemented by the	library	 or
       server, such as X11, FS, and ICE.

       All libraries and servers that use the X Transport Interface
       should have a new file called transport.c.  This	 file  will
       include	the  transports	 based	on  the configuration flags
       4mConnectionFlags24m. Below is an example transport.c.

       #include "Xtransint.h"

       #ifdef DNETCONN
       #include "Xtransdnet.c"
       #endif
       #ifdef LOCALCONN
       #include "Xtranslocal.c"
       #endif
       #ifdef TCPCONN
       #include "Xtranssock.c"
       #endif
       #ifdef STREAMSCONN
       #include "Xtranstli.c"
       #endif
       #include "Xtrans.c"
       #include "Xtransutil.c"


       The source files for this interface are listed below.


















       Xtrans.h	       Function prototypes and defines for
		       the Transport Independent API.
       Xtransint.h     Used by the interface implementation only.
		       Contains the internal data structures.
       Xtranssock.c    Socket implementation of the Transport Dependent API.
       Xtranstli.c     TLI implementation of the Transport Dependent API.
       Xtransdnet.c    DECnet implementation of the Transport Dependent API.
       Xtranslocal.c   Implementation of the Transport Dependent API for
		       SYSV Local connections.
       Xtrans.c	       Exposed Transport Independent API Functions.
       Xtransutil.c    Collection of Utility functions that use the
		       X Transport Interface.


       The file 4mXtransint.h24m contains much of the transport	 related
       code  that  previously in Xlibint.h and Xlibnet.h. This will
       make the definitions available for all transport users. This
       should also obsolete the equivalent code in other libraries.
