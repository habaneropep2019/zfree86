1mDefinitions0m

4mc24m	  The literal character 4mc24m.

4mC24m	  A single (required) character.

4mPs24m	  A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of one of
     more digits.

4mPm24m	  A multiple numeric parameter composed of any number of single
     numeric parameters, separated by ;	 character(s).	Individual val-
     ues for the parameters are listed with 4mPs24m .

4mPt24m	  A text parameter composed of printable characters.

1mC1 (8-Bit) Control Characters0m

The 4mxterm24m program recognizes both 8-bit and 7-bit control characters.
It generates 7-bit controls (by default) or 8-bit if S8C1T is enabled.
The following pairs of 7-bit and 8-bit control characters are equiva-
lent:

ESC D
     Index (IND	 is 0x84)
ESC E
     Next Line (NEL  is 0x85)
ESC H
     Tab Set (HTS  is 0x88)
ESC M
     Reverse Index (RI	is 0x8d)
ESC N
     Single Shift Select of G2 Character Set (SS2  is 0x8e): affects
     next character only
ESC O
     Single Shift Select of G3 Character Set (SS3  is 0x8f): affects
     next character only
ESC P
     Device Control String (DCS	 is 0x90)
ESC V
     Start of Guarded Area (SPA	 is 0x96)
ESC W
     End of Guarded Area (EPA  is 0x97)
ESC X
     Start of String (SOS  is 0x98)
ESC Z
     Return Terminal ID (DECID is 0x9a).  Obsolete form of CSI c  (DA).
ESC [
     Control Sequence Introducer (CSI  is 0x9b)
ESC \
     String Terminator (ST  is 0x9c)
ESC ]
     Operating System Command (OSC  is 0x9d)
ESC ^
     Privacy Message (PM  is 0x9e)
ESC _
     Application Program Command (APC  is 0x9f)

These control characters are used in the vtXXX emulation.

1mVT100 Mode0m
Most of these control sequences are standard VT102 control sequences,
but there is support for later DEC VT terminals (i.e., VT220, VT320,
VT420), as well as ISO 6429 and 4maixterm24m color controls.  The only VT102
features not supported is auto-repeat, since the only way X provides for
this will affect all windows.  There are additional control sequences to
provide 4mxterm-24mdependent functions, such as the scrollbar or window size.
Where the function is specified by DEC or ISO 6429, the code assigned to
it is given in parentheses.  The escape codes to designate and invoke
character sets are specified by ISO 2022; see that document for a dis-
cussion of character sets.

LF	       Line Feed or New Line (NL) (Ctrl-J)
SO	       Shift Out (Ctrl-N) -> Switch to Alternate Character Set:
	       invokes the G1 character set.
SP	       Space.
TAB	       Horizontal Tab (HT) (Ctrl-I)
VT	       Vertical Tab (Ctrl-K) same as LF
SI	       Shift In (Ctrl-O) -> Switch to Standard Character Set:
	       invokes the G0 character set (the default).

1mApplication Program-Control functions0m
APC 4mPt24m ST	    4mxterm24m implements no APC  functions; 4mPt24m is ignored.  4mPt0m
	       need not be printable characters.

1mDevice-Control functions0m
DCS 4mPs24m; 4mPs24m| 4mPt24m ST
	       User-Defined Keys (DECUDK).  The first parameter:
		 4mPs24m = 0  -> Clear all UDK definitions before starting
	       (default)
		 4mPs24m = 1  -> Erase Below (default)
	       The second parameter:
		 4mPs24m = 0  -> Lock the keys (default)
		 4mPs24m = 1  -> Do not lock.
	       The third parameter is a ';'-separated list of strings
	       denoting the key-code separated by a '/' from the hex-
	       encoded key value.  The key codes correspond to the DEC
	       function-key codes (e.g., F6=17).
DCS $ q 4mPt24m ST  Request Status String (DECRQSS).  The string following
	       the "q" is one of the following:
		 " q	 -> DECSCA
		 " p	 -> DECSCL
		 r	 -> DECSTBM
		 m	 -> SGR
	       4mxterm24m responds with DCS 1 $ r 4mPt24m ST for valid requests,
	       replacing the 4mPt24m with the corresponding CSI string, or
	       DCS 0 $ r 4mPt24m ST for invalid requests.
DCS + q 4mPt24m ST  Request Termcap/Terminfo String (xterm, experimental).
	       The string following the "q" is a list of names encoded
	       in hexadecimal (2 digits per character) separated by ;
	       which correspond to termcap or terminfo key names.
	       4mxterm24m responds with DCS 1 + r 4mPt24m ST for valid requests,
	       adding to 4mPt24m an = , and the value of the corresponding
	       string that xterm would send, or DCS 0 + r 4mPt24m ST for
	       invalid requests.  The strings are encoded in hexadecimal
	       (2 digits per character).

	       pasting by other applications.
	       If the second parameter is a ? , 4mxterm24m replies to the
	       host with the selection data encoded using the same pro-
	       tocol.

1mPrivacy Message0m
PM 4mPt24m ST	    4mxterm24m implements no PM	 functions; 4mPt24m is ignored.	 4mPt0m
	       need not be printable characters.

1mPC-Style Function Keys0m
If 4mxterm24m does minimal translation of the function keys, it usually does
this with a PC-style keyboard, so PC-style function keys result.  Sun
keyboards are similar to PC keyboards.	Both have cursor and scrolling
operations printed on the keypad, which duplicate the smaller cursor and
scrolling keypads.
X does not predefine NumLock (used for VT220 keyboards) or Alt (used as
an extension for the Sun/PC keyboards) as modifiers.  These keys are
recognized as modifiers when enabled by the 1mnumLock 22mresource, or by the
DECSET 1 0 3 5	control sequence.
The cursor keys transmit the following escape sequences depending on the
mode specified via the 1mDECCKM 22mescape sequence.

		      1mKey	    Normal    Application0m
		  --------------------------------------
		  1mCursor Up	   CSI A      SS3 A0m
		  1mCursor Down	   CSI B      SS3 B0m
		  1mCursor Right   CSI C      SS3 C0m
		  1mCursor Left	   CSI D      SS3 D0m
		  --------------------------------------

The home- and end-keys (unlike PageUp and other keys also on the 6-key
editing keypad) are considered "cursor keys" by 4mxterm24m.  Their mode is
also controlled by the 1mDECCKM 22mescape sequence:

		      1mKey	  Normal    Application0m
		    ----------------------------------
		    1mHome	 CSI H	    SS3 H0m
		    1mEnd	 CSI F	    SS3 F0m
		    ----------------------------------

The application keypad transmits the following escape sequences depend-
ing on the mode specified via the 1mDECPNM 22mand 1mDECPAM 22mescape sequences.
Use the NumLock key to override the application mode.
Not all keys are present on the Sun/PC keypad (e.g., PF1, Tab), but are
supported by the program.

They also provide 12 function keys, as well as a few other special-pur-
pose keys.

		       ---------------------------

Older versions of 4mxterm24m implement different escape sequences for F1
through F4.  These can be activated by setting the 1moldXtermFKeys0m
resource.  However, since they do not correspond to any hardware termi-
nal, they have been deprecated.	 (The DEC VT220 reserves F1 through F5
for local functions such as 1mSetup22m).

			 1mKey	    Escape Sequence0m

		       1mF1	    CSI 1 1 ~0m

		       1mF3	    CSI 1 3 ~0m
		       1mF4	    CSI 1 4 ~0m
		       ---------------------------

In normal mode, i.e., a Sun/PC keyboard when the 1msunKeyboard 22mresource is
false, 4mxterm24m recognizes function key modifiers which are parameters
appended before the final character of the control sequence.

		      1mCode	 Modifiers0m

		       1m7	 Alt + Control0m
		       1m8	 Shift + Alt + Control0m
		    ---------------------------------

For example, shift-F5 would be sent as CSI 1 5 ; 2 ~

If the 1malwaysUseMods 22mresource is set, the Meta modifier also is recog-
nized, making parameters 9 through 16.

1mVT220-Style Function Keys0m
However, 4mxterm24m is most useful as a DEC VT102 or VT220 emulator.  Set the
1msunKeyboard 22mresource to true to force a Sun/PC keyboard to act like a
VT220 keyboard.
The VT102/VT220 application keypad transmits unique escape sequences in
application mode, which are distinct from the cursor and scrolling key-
pad:

The VT220 provides a 6-key editing keypad, which is analogous to that on
the PC keyboard.  It is not affected by 1mDECCKM 22mor 1mDECPNM22m/1mDECPAM22m:

		     1mKey	 Normal	   Application0m
		   ----------------------------------
		   Insert     1mCSI 2 ~	   CSI 2 ~0m

		   PageUp     1mCSI 5 ~	   CSI 5 ~0m
		   PageDown   1mCSI 6 ~	   CSI 6 ~0m
		   ----------------------------------

The VT220 provides 8 additional function keys.	With a Sun/PC keyboard,
access these keys by Control/F1 for F13, etc.

1mVT52-Style Function Keys0m
A VT52 does not have function keys, but it does have a numeric keypad
and cursor keys.  They differ from the other emulations by the prefix.
Also, the cursor keys do not change:

		       1mKey	    Normal/Application0m
		   ----------------------------------
		   1mCursor Up	    ESC A0m
		   1mCursor Down    ESC B0m
		   1mCursor Right   ESC C0m
		   1mCursor Left    ESC D0m
		   ----------------------------------

The keypad is similar:

		  --------------------------------------
		  1mSpace	   SP	      ESC ? SP0m
		  1mTab		   TAB	      ESC ? I0m

		  --------------------------------------


1mSun-Style Function Keys0m
The 4mxterm24m program provides support for Sun keyboards more directly, by a
menu toggle that causes it to send Sun-style function key codes rather
than VT220.  Note, however, that the 4msun24m and 4mVT10024m emulations are not
really compatible.  For example, their wrap-margin behavior differs.
Only function keys are altered; keypad and cursor keys are the same.
The emulation responds identically.  See the xterm-sun terminfo entry
for details.

1mHP-Style Function Keys0m
Similarly, 4mxterm24m can be compiled to support HP keyboards.	See the
xterm-hp terminfo entry for details.

1mThe Alternate Screen Buffer0m
1mXterm 22mmaintains two screen buffers.  The normal screen buffer allows you
to scroll back to view saved lines of output up to the maximum set by
the 1msaveLines 22mresource.  The alternate screen buffer is exactly as large
as the display, contains no additional saved lines.  When the alternate
screen buffer is active, you cannot scroll back to view saved lines.
1mXterm 22mprovides control sequences and menu entries for switching between
the two.
Most full-screen applications use terminfo or termcap to obtain strings
used to start/stop full-screen mode, i.e., 4msmcup24m and 4mrmcup24m for terminfo,
or the corresponding 4mti24m and 4mte24m for termcap.  The 1mtiteInhibit 22mresource
removes the 4mti24m and 4mte24m strings from the TERMCAP string which is set in
the environment for some platforms.  That is not done when 1mxterm 22mis
built with terminfo libraries because terminfo does not provide the
whole text of the termcap data in one piece.  It would not work for ter-
minfo anyway, since terminfo data is not passed in environment vari-
ables; setting an environment variable in this manner would have no
effect on the application's ability to switch between normal and alter-
nate screen buffers.  Instead, the newer private mode controls (such as
1 0 4 9 ) for switching between normal and alternate screen buffers sim-
ply disable the switching.  They add other features such as clearing the
display for the same reason: to make the details of switching indepen-
dent of the application that requests the switch.

1mBracketed Paste Mode0m
When bracketed paste mode is set, pasted text is bracketed with control
sequences so that the program can differentiate pasted text from typed-
in text.  When bracketed paste mode is set, the program will receive:
ESC [ 200 ~, followed by the pasted text, followed by ESC [ 201 ~.

1mMouse Tracking0m
The VT widget can be set to send the mouse position and other informa-
tion on button presses.	 These modes are typically used by editors and
other full-screen applications that want to make use of the mouse.

There are six mutually exclusive modes.	 One is DEC Locator mode,
enabled by the DECELR CSI 4mPs24m ; 4mPs24m  ´z control sequence, and is not
described here (control sequences are summarized above).  The remaining
five modes are each enabled (or disabled) by a different parameter in
DECSET CSI ? 4mPm24m h or DECRST CSI ? 4mPm24m l control sequence.

Manifest constants for the parameter values are defined in 1mxcharmouse.h0m
as follows:

		#define SET_X10_MOUSE		    9
		#define SET_VT200_MOUSE		    1000
		#define SET_VT200_HIGHLIGHT_MOUSE   1001
		#define SET_BTN_EVENT_MOUSE	    1002
		#define SET_ANY_EVENT_MOUSE	    1003

The motion reporting modes are strictly 4mxterm24m extensions, and are not
part of any standard, though they are analogous to the DEC VT200 DECELR
locator reports.

Parameters (such as pointer position and button number) for all mouse
tracking escape sequences generated by 4mxterm24m encode numeric parameters
in a single character as 4mvalue24m+32.	 For example, !	 specifies the value
1.  The upper left character position on the terminal is denoted as 1,1.

X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence only on button press,
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.  It is enabled by
specifying parameter 9 to DECSET.  On button press, 4mxterm24m sends CSI M
4mCbCxCy24m (6 characters).  4mCb24m is button-1.  4mCx24m and 4mCy24m are the x and y coor-
dinates of the mouse when the button was pressed.

Normal tracking mode sends an escape sequence on both button press and
release.  Modifier key (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1000 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, 4mxterm24m sends CSI M 4mCbCxCy24m.  The low two bits of 4mCb24m encode button
information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
The next three bits encode the modifiers which were down when the button
was pressed and are added together:  4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.  Note
however that the shift and control bits are normally unavailable because
4mxterm24m uses the control modifier with mouse for popup menus, and the
shift modifier is used in the default translations for button events.
The 4mMeta24m modifier recognized by 4mxterm24m is the 4mmod124m mask, and is not nec-
essarily the "Meta" key (see 4mxmodmap24m).  4mCx24m and 4mCy24m are the x and y coor-
dinates of the mouse event, encoded as in X10 mode.

Wheel mice may return buttons 4 and 5.	Those buttons are represented by
the same event codes as buttons 1 and 2 respectively, except that 64 is
added to the event code.  Release events for the wheel buttons are not
reported.

Mouse highlight tracking notifies a program of a button press, receives
a range of lines from the program, highlights the region covered by the
mouse within that range until button release, and then sends the program
the release coordinates.  It is enabled by specifying parameter 1001 to
DECSET.	 Highlighting is performed only for button 1, though other but-
ton events can be received.  1mWarning: 22muse of this mode requires a coop-
erating program or it will hang 4mxterm.24m  On button press, the same infor-
mation as for normal tracking is generated; 4mxterm24m then waits for the
program to send mouse tracking information.  4mAll24m 4mX24m 4mevents24m 4mare24m 4mignored0m
4muntil24m 4mthe24m 4mproper24m 4mescape24m 4msequence24m 4mis24m 4mreceived24m 4mfrom24m 4mthe24m 4mpty:24m CSI 4mPs24m ; 4mPs24m ;
4mPs24m ; 4mPs24m ; 4mPs24m T .	 The parameters are 4mfunc,24m 4mstartx,24m 4mstarty,24m 4mfirstrow,24m and
4mlastrow.24m  4mfunc24m is non-zero to initiate highlight tracking and zero to
abort.	4mstartx24m and 4mstarty24m give the starting x and y location for the
highlighted region.  The ending location tracks the mouse, but will
never be above row 4mfirstrow24m and will always be above row 4mlastrow.24m  (The
top of the screen is row 1.)  When the button is released, 4mxterm24m reports
the ending position one of two ways: if the start and end coordinates
are valid text locations: CSI t 4mCxCy24m.  If either coordinate is past the
end of the line: CSI T 4mCxCyCxCyCxCy24m.  The parameters are 4mstartx,24m 4mstarty,0m
4mendx,24m 4mendy,24m 4mmousex,24m and 4mmousey.24m  4mstartx,24m 4mstarty,24m 4mendx,24m and 4mendy24m give the
starting and ending character positions of the region.	4mmousex24m and
4mmousey24m give the location of the mouse at button up, which may not be
over a character.

Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal tracking, but
4mxterm24m also reports button-motion events.  Motion events are reported
only if the mouse pointer has moved to a different character cell.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1002 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, 4mxterm24m sends the same codes used by normal tracking mode.	On
button-motion events, 4mxterm24m adds 32 to the event code (the third charac-
ter, 4mCb24m).	The other bits of the event code specify button and modifier
keys as in normal mode.	 For example, motion into cell x,y with button 1
down is reported as CSI M @ 4mCxCy24m.	( @  = 32 + 0 (button 1) + 32 (motion
indicator) ).  Similarly, motion with button 3 down is reported as CSI M
B 4mCxCy24m.  ( B  = 32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion indicator) ).

Any-event mode is the same as button-event mode, except that all motion
events are reported, even if no mouse button is down.  It is enabled by
specifying 1003 to DECSET.

1mTektronix 4014 Mode0m
Most of these sequences are standard Tektronix 4014 control sequences.
Graph mode supports the 12-bit addressing of the Tektronix 4014.  The
major features missing are the write-through and defocused modes.  This
document does not describe the commands used in the various Tektronix
plotting modes but does describe the commands to switch modes.
